genius IQ's living in China than there
are people of any kind living in the
United States?"
1,ERICA (V.O. ),1,That can't be true.
2,MARK (V.O.),2,it is true.
3,ERICA (V.O.),3,What would account for that?
4,MARK (V.0.),4,"Well first of all, a lot of people live
in China. But here's my question:"
5,FADE IN,5,"MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of
any physically intimidating attributes masks a very
complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye
contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you
or to himself.
ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door face
that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the
conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there
and her politeness is about to be tested.
The scene is stark and simple."
6,MARK,6,"How do you distinguish yourself in a
population of people who all got 1600 on
their SAT's?"
7,ERICA,7,I didn't know they take SAT's in China.
8,MARK,8,"I wasn't talking about China anymore, I
was talking about here."
9,ERICA,9,You got 1600?
10,MARK,10,"You can sing in an a Capella group.
2."
11,BRICA,11,"Does that mean that you actually got
nothing wrong?"
12,MARK,12,"Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar
PC."
13,ERICA,13,Or you get into a final club.
14,MARK,14,"Or you get into a final club, exactly."
15,ERICA,15,I like guys who row crew.
16,"MARK
(BEAT)",16,"Well I can't do that. And yes, it means I
got nothing wrong on the test."
17,ERICA,17,Have you ever tried?
18,MARK,18,I'm trying now.
19,ERICA,19,To row crew?
20,MARK,20,"To get into a final club. To row crew?
No. Are you, like--whatever--crazy?"
21,ERICA,21,"Sometimes, Mark-seriously-YOU say two
things at once and I'm not sure which one
we're talking about."
22,MARK,22,"But you've seen guys who row crew, right?"
23,ERICA,23,No.
24,MARK,24,"Okay, well.. they're bigger than me.
They're world class athletes. And a
second ago you said you like guys who row
crew so I assumed you'd met one."
25,ERICA,25,"I guess I meant I liked the idea of it.
The way a girl likes cowboys.
3."
26,MARK,26,The Phoenix is good.
27,ERICA,27,This is a new topic?
28,MARK,28,It's the same topic.
29,ERICA,29,"We're still talking about the finals
clubs?"
30,MARK,30,"Would you rather talk about something
else?"
31,ERICA,31,"It's just that since the beginning of
the conversation about finals clubs I
think I may have had a birthday."
32,MARK,32,"We can change the subject.
ERICA.
(can't get over it)
There are more people in China with genius
IQ's than the entire population of--"
33,MARK,33,It's about exclusivity.
34,T'RICA,34,.....what is?
35,MARK,35,"The final clubs. And that's how you
distinguish yourself. The Phoenix is the
most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt
punched the Porc."
36,ERICA,36,Which one?
37,MARK,37,"The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best
of the best."
38,ERICA,38,I actually meant which Roosevelt.
39,MARK,39,"Theodore.
4."
40,ERICA,40,"Okay, well, which is the easiest one to
get into?
MARK takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag
and blows the smoke out before he says..."
41,MARK,41,Hm.
42,ERICA,42,What?
43,MARK,43,why would you ask me that?
44,ERICA,44,I was just asking.
45,MARK,45,"They're all hard to get into. My friend
Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil
futures last summer and he won't get in.
Money or the ability to make it doesn't
impress anybody around here. Everybody
can do that."
46,ERICA,46,"He made $300,000 in a summer?"
47,MARK,47,He likes meteorology.
48,ERICA,48,You said it was oil futures.
49,MARK,49,"If you can predict the weather you can
predict the price of heating oil. You
asked me that because you think the final
club that's easiest to get into is the
one where I'll have the best chance,"
50,"ERICA
(BEAT)",50,I've lost my place again.
51,MARK,51,"You asked me which one was the easiest to
get into because you think that's where I
have the best chance."
52,ERICA,52,"The one that's easiest to get into would
be the one where anybody had the best
chance.
S."
53,MARK,53,"I just think you asked--the placement of
where you asked the question--"
54,ERICA,54,"I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was
asking just to ask. Mark, I'm not
speaking in code."
55,MARK,55,Erica--
56,ERICA,56,"You're obsessed with the finals clubs.
You have finals clubs OCD and you need to
see someone about this who'll prescribe
some sort of medication. You don't care
if side effects may include blindness,
okay, just do it."
57,MARK,57,"Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there's
a difference between being obsessed and
being motivated."
58,ERICA,58,Yes there is.
59,MARK,59,"Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do
speak in code."
60,ERICA,60,I didn't mean to be cryptic.
61,MARK,61,"I'm saving I need to do something
substantial in order to get the attention
of the clubs."
62,ERICA,62,Why?
63,MARK,63,Because they're exclusive.
64,(BEAT),64,And fun and they lead to a better life.
65,ERICA,65,"You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected
president because he was a member of the
Phoenix Club?"
66,MARK,66,"He was a member of the Porcellian and yes
I do.
6."
67,ERICA,67,Maybe he sang in an a Capella group.
68,MARK,68,"I want to be straight forward and tell
you that I think you should be a lot more
supportive. If I get in I'll be taking
you to the parties and you'll be meeting
people that you wouldn't normally get to
meet."
69,"ERICA
(SMILES)",69,You would do that for me?
70,MARK,70,You're my girlfriend.
71,ERICA,71,"okay, well I want to be straight forward
and tell you that I'm not anymore."
72,"MARK
(BEAT)",72,What do you mean?
73,ERICA,73,"I'm not your girlfriend anymore,"
74,MARK,74,Is this a joke?
75,ERICA,75,"No, I'm sorry, it's not."
76,MARK,76,You're breaking up with me?
77,ERICA,77,"You're going to introduce me to people I
wouldn't normally get to meet? What the
fuck is that supposed to mean?"
78,MARK,78,Take it easy.
79,ERICA,79,What was it supposed to mean?
80,MARK,80,"It was--Erica, the reason we're able to
sit here and drink is that you used to
sleep with the door guy."
81,"ERICA
(PAUSE)",81,I want to really try not to lose it now.
82,(MORE),82,7.
83,ERICA (CONT'D),83,"The door guy's name is Bobby. I haven't

97,MARK,97,Why?
98,ERICA,98,"Because it's exhausting. Going out with

you're not likely to--I wasn't making a

impressed with my education."

107,ERICA,107,I think we should just be friends.
108,MARK,108,I don't need friends.

being friends with you."

rich. But you're going to go through life

it. We know that-he lied to. our faces for
a month and a half-while he--"
670,CAMERON,670,He didn't lie to our faces.
671,DIVYA,671,"He never saw our. faces! Fine, he lied to
our e-mail accounts and he got himself a
42-day head start because he knows what
apparently you don't which is that
getting there first is everythinal"
672,CAMERON,672,"I'm a competitive racer, Div, I don't
think you need to school me on the
importance of getting there first."
673,"DIVYA

the phone with you?"
674,CAMERON,674,"Yeah, well his in-house counsel, We're
gonna send him everything and he'll look
at it and if he thinks it's appropriate
he'll send a cease and desist letter.
61."
675,DIVYA,675,"A cease and desist letter doesn't have
any teeth."
676,CAMERON,676,"You think we should hire lawyers and sue
him?"
677,DIVYA,677,"I think we should hire lawyers and have
them beat him senseless with a crescent
wrench."
678,TYLER,678,We don't have to do that.
679,CAMERON,679,That's right.
680,TYLER,680,We can do it ourselves.

TYLER",681,"I'm six-five, 220-pounds and there are
two of me."
682,CAMERON,682,"And I'm saying let's Calm down until we
know what we're talking about."
683,DIVYA,683,"Just how much more information are you
waiting for? We met with Mark three
times, we exchanged 52 e-mails, we can
prove that he looked at the code, he'd
seen what Victor had already done and we
talked at length about what we planned to
do."
684,(POINTING),684,The page looks the same:

It says ""A Mark Zuckerberg Production""."

They wr ""Zuckerberg said that he
hoped the prly options would help to
restore his reputation following student
outrage over Facemash.com""."

telling us to go fuck ourselves. We know
plenty of people at the Crimson. While
we're waiting for dad's lawyer to look
this over, we can at least---"
692,CAMERON,692,No.
693,TYLER,693,"--get something going in the paper so
that people know-"
694,CAMERON,694,What?
695,TYLER,695,That this thing is in dispute.
696,CAMERON,696,"We're not starting a knife fight in the
Crimson and we're not suing anybody."
697,DIVYA,697,"Why not?
CAMERON wants-to answer the question but doesn't.."

idea, did you know that Cameron and Tyler
carne from a family of means?"

tax last year, go on."

members of a Harvard final club called
the Porcellian."

724,(TO MARK),724,"So it's safe to say you were aware that
my clients had money?"
725,MARK,725,Yes.
726,GAGE,726,"Let.me tell you why I'm asking. I'm
wondering why, if you needed a thousand
dollars to start up your project, you
didn't ask my clients for it. They'd
demonstrated to you an interest in this
kind of thing so--"
727,MARY,727,"From that you're deducing that I didn't
go to them because I didn't want them to
know what I was working on? I went to my
best friend for the money because he's
who I wanted to be partners with because
of our similar vision and his superior
business skills. Eduardo was president of
the Harvard Investors Association and he
was my best friend.

728,GAGE,728,"Your best friend is suing you for 600-
million dollars."

him as Mr. Saverin?"

733,GRETCHEN,733,Not anymore.

736,DIVYA,736,"Everyone on campus was using it.
""Facebook me"" was a common expression
after two weeks."

738,DIVYA,738,"Mark was the biggest thing on a campus
that included 19 Nobel. Laureates, 15
Pulitzer Prize winners, two future
Olympians and a movie star."

743,SPEAKER (VO),743,"The seminal event for me was when he was
in Harvard Square and picked up a copy of
Popular Electronics Magazine that ha the
MITS Altair Kit on the cover."
744,SPEAKER (VO),744,"There's a lower-level and a balcony and both are full.
MARK and EDUARDO are sitting in the second to last row of the
balcony.
We'll hear the SPEAKER but we'll only get to see him in a
slightly blurry image as our attention is on MARK and EDUARDO."
745,SPEAKER,745,"And it was a clear day, And I was up in
my Radcliffe dorm. And he brought that up
there and said, ""Look, it's going to
happen without us. We've got to do it
now."" And so I said...""Okay.""
He gets an appreciative LAUGH from the STUDENTS."
746,SPEAKER (CONT'D),746,"Now the startingâ¢of this industry was
very humble indeed. The kit computer on
the cover-of that magazine--
We HEAR a little muffled giggling coming from the row behind
MARK and EDUARDO, MARK is too into the speech to notice but
the giggling registers as a slight annoyance on EDUARDO's
face."
747,SPEAKER (CONT'D),747,"--had an 8080 processor in it, and you
had to assemble it yourself and it came
with 256K of memory.
EDUARDO hears the giggling again and turns around.
In the row behind them and a few seats over are two beautiful
Asian students.--ALICE and JENNY. They're a little overly made-
up for a lecture. JENNY, the one sitting closest to EDUARDO,
is wearing a short skirt with a white shirt: open one button
too far down the front and we can see a hint of the red bra
she's wearing underneath.

She leans forward and whispers to EDUARDO--"
748,"JENNY

749,"EDUARDO

our--we're--yes."
752,"JENNY
(STILL WHISPERING)",752,"Way cool. I'm Jenny. This is Alice.
EDUARDO can't help noticing--just because it's in his line of
sight--that down the row from the girls, someone else is
pointing at them and whispering to a friend.
Then back to the girls--"
753,"EDUARDO
(WHISPERING)",753,Very nice to meet you.
754,"JENNY
(WHISPERING)",754,"Facebook me when you get home. Maybe we
can all go out for a drink later."
755,"EDUARDO
(WHISPERING)",755,"Certainly. I'll certainly--absolutely I
will do that.
EDUARDO turns back to the speaker, who MARK hasn't taken his
eyes off of--"

EDUARDO--always in his suit-.-is buttoning up his overcoat as
he walks and MARK zips up his hoodie."
759,EDUARDO,759,"She said ""Facebook me"" and we can all
have a drink later. Which is stunningly
great for two reasons. One, she said
""Facebook me"". Right? And the other is
that, you know--"
760,MARK,760,They want to have drinks later.
761,EDUARDO,761,"Yes: Have you ever heard so many
different good things packed into one
ordinary-sized sentence?
A group of guys hustle up to MARK and EDUARDO--"

782,EDUARDO,782,I said it's time to monetize the site.

JENNY, sitting at a table. with an empty seat waiting."
1146,JENNY,1146,They're not gonna card us here.
1147,EDUARDO,1147,They might.
1148,JENNY,1148,Look around.
1149,EDUARDO,1149,"It' :l.l be embarrassing,"
1150,"JENNY

1153,MARK,1153,Are you gonna talk about ads again?
1154,EDUARDO,1154,"Unless you're the Ballet Theatre of
Hartford, the urpose of a business is to
make a profit.'"
1155,MARK,1155,This isn't a business.

business head of the company.
MARK says nothing..."

1158,MARK,1158,"He's a god, he can be as late as he
wants."

1160,MARK,1160,What is he?
1161,EDUARDO,1161,25 minutes late.
1162,JENNY,1162,"I think Wardo's jealous.
CUT BACK TO:"
1163,EDUARDO,1163,I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.
1164,GRETCHEN,1164,Why?
1165,EDUARDO,1165,"I didn't know him at all but I'd done an
internet search and asked around. He
struck me as kind of a wild man.
CUT BACK TO:

TNT. 66 - NIGHT"
1166,JENNY,1166,Why?
1167,EDUARDO,1167,"He crashed out of two pretty big internet
companies in-spectacular fashion and he's
got a reputation with drugs."
1168,MARK,1168,He also founded'the companies.
1169,EDUARDO,1169,We don't need him.
1170,MARK,1170,"(nodding toward the door)
He's here.
SEAN PARKER has stepped into the restaurant and is. saying
hello to the hostess while hugging a waitress."
1171,EDUARDO,1171,"And he does own a watch.
SEAN stops at a table to shake hands with a guy in a suit and
kiss his girlfriend. It's sort of an incongruous sight--this
22 year old kid who's able to work a room like Sinatra. Who
the hell is this?"
1172,EDUARDO,1172,"(quiet] ) .
Take your time..."
1173,JENNY,1173,"Stop it.
SEAN makes his way'over to MARK's table--"

EDU.ARDO"
1175,(SHAKING HANDS),1175,How do you do.

its great to meet you."

1181,WAITRESS,1181,Hey baby boy.
1182,SEAN,1182,"Could you bring out some things? The
lacquered pork with that ginger confit? I
don't know, tuna tartar, some lobster
claws, the foie gras and the shrimp
dumplings, that'll get us started. Jenny,
what do you like to drink?"
1183,JENNY,1183,An appletini?
1184,SEAN,1184,Great. Four.
1185,EDUARDO,1185,"From that point on it was a Sean-a-thon.
I'd never seen anyone perform a monologue
at dinner before but that's what
happened."
1186,CUT TO:,1186,"The CA[ERA is moving around the table as SEAN--in and out of
MOS-â¢-is telling story after story while food is brought,
drinks put down, more food brought and more drinks put down.
MARK is enthralled, JENNY is sexy and EDUARDO is polite.
EDUARDO (V.O.)
He took us through his episode with
Napster ."

35 million they said we owed in royalties
and in the end we just had to declare
bankruptcy but I made a name for myself.

1188,JENNY,1188,"I'll say.
EDUARDO (V.o.)
And then he went to his second business
venture which was Plaxo, an online
rolodex."
1189,SEAN,1189,"See, we had a VC from the beginning.
Michael Moritz, a partner at Sequoia
Capital who'd invested in Yahoo and
Google. Moritz wanted to push me out from"
1190,THE BE,1190,"ginning and he hired private detectives to dig up everything on me
they could. Did they find anything? No.
But I was out of the company. I'm not
done with Moritz and Sequoia Capital yet.
I swear to God, Mark, before I'm 25 I'm
gonna make those guys kiss my ass and
then cry like girls, There will be
retribution for Plaxo and I'm not just
talking. I brought down the record
companies with Napster and I'll bring
down Michael Moritz,"
1191,E DUARDO,1191,"You didn't bring down the record
companies, They won."
1192,SEAN,1192,"In court.
.EDUARDO"
1193,(BEAT),1193,Yes.
1194,SEAN,1194,"(shrugging it off)
Well.
EDUARDO (V.O.)
And he told story after story about life
in Silicon Valley, parties at Stanford
and-down in LA, friends who"" d become
billionaires--and then he finally got
around to theFacebook."
1195,SEAN,1195,Tell me about your progress.
1196,EDUARDO,1196,Well... we're in 29 schools now and we
1197,HAVE OVER--,1197,103.
1198,SEAN,1198,(ignoring EDUARDO and going for
1199,MARK),1199,Tell me about the strategy you're using.
1200,MARK,1200,"Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor in
Texas but Baylor already had a social
network on campus so instead of going
right after them, we made a list of every
school within a hundred miles and put
theFacebook on those campuses first.
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were
seeing their friends on our site and we
were in."
1201,SEAN,1201,Perfect.
1202,EDAURDO,1202,"Thank you, it was mine."
1203,"JENNY
(TO EDUARDO)",1203,Easy.
1204,EDUARDO,1204,"Settle an argument for us, would you? I
say it's time to start making money from
theFacebook but Mark doesn't want
advertising. Who's right?"
1205,SEAN,1205,"Neither of you. TheFacebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it."
1206,MART,1206,Yes.
1207,SEAN,1207,"You don't want to ruin it with ads
because ads aren't cool."
1208,MARK,1208,Exactly.
1209,SEAN,1209,"it's like you're throwing the coolest
party on campus and someone's telling you
it's gotta be over at 11:00.
MARY,
Exactly."
1210,SEAN,1210,"You don't even know what the thing is
yâ¬t.
104,"
1211,MARK,1211,I said exactly that.
1212,SEAN,1212,"Row big it can get and how far it can go.
Picture sharing, news feeds, a virtual
champagne room, apps you haven't even
thought of. This.is no time to take your
chips down. A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?"
1213,EDUARDO,1213,You?
1214,SEAN,1214,"A billion dollars. And that's where
you're headed. A billion dollar
valuation. Unless you take bad advice in
which case you might as well have come up
with a chain of very successful dry
cleaners. When you go fishing you can
catch a lot of fish or you can catch a
big fish. You ever walk into a guy's den
and see a picture of him standing next to
fourteen trout? No, he's holding an. 800
pound marlin and that's what you want.
Hey guys, it's your company, I don't have
a dog in this fight. Irjust came to say
hi."
1215,EDUO,1215,"No, he came to hook an 800 pound marlin
and he did. He owned Mark after that
dinner. He picked up the check, told Mark
they'd talk again soon and was gone. But
not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.
CUT BACK.TO:"
1216,SEAN,1216,"(signing the check)
Oh Hey. Drop the ""the"". Just Facebook,
It's cleaner.
And SEAN heads out, patting backs and kissing waitresses along
the way."
1217,"MARK
(KNOCKED OUT)",1217,"Shit.
105."
1218,EDUARDO,1218,"That's gotta be some kind of land speed
record for talking."
1219,MARK,1219,You want to end the party at eleven.
1220,EDUARDO,1220,I'm trying to pay for the party.
1221,MARK,1221,There won't be a party unless it's cool.
1222,(BEAT),1222,What'd you think?
1223,EDUARDO,1223,"Sure, let's drop the ""the""."
1224,MARK,1224,"I meant catching the marlin instead of
the 1.4 trout. Doesn't that sound good?"
1225,EDUARDO,1225,Only if you're a trout.
1226,GRETCHEN,1226,"I'M going to enter this as Plaintiff's
Exhibit 54. Incorporation papers for

done anything that would be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?"

already put Facebook and different pins showing the schools

And after a moment of placid quiet--"
1431,---BOOSHI,1431,"Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for
the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and
prestigious Henley Royal Regatta.
The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The
port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the
Ilollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a
pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the ""H"" of
Harvard.
We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing
section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot
-- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n
blazers and brightly colored floral ties.
But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just
their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural.
straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half
torture test against the best competition they've ever faced.
And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the
Dutch.
The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of
them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late.
Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving
the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of
Americans.
124.
We'll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and latex
we'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next
to him is their mother, who can barely watch.
Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice
through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and
there's still no daylight between them.
We see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON's left hand begin
to stream down his arm.
25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy--
even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups
the closest race in the history of the competition. The 'ATH_PT'ï¿½
is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed--
the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.
The blood that's covering CAMERON's left arm is being diluted
by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig,
and pull, and pull, and pull, and---
POP!
--the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of
the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.
CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch
group holding a giant flag and.jumping up and down. The
Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.
The two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug
as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.
The MOTHER drops her head-and looks down. The FATHER refuses
to look away.
From CAMERON and TYLER, just the'breathing.,"

After a moment, a man in a double breasted navy blazer steps
out with his retinue in tow. The man is PRINCE ALBERT of
Monaco. He receives a healthy clapping of golf applause as he
approaches the stand.

1734,SEAN,1734,Oh dude.
1735,MARK,1735,What?
1736,SEAN,1736,"Yeah.
An intern, ASHLEIGH, comes along With a small package--"
1737,ASHLEIGH,1737,"Excuse me, Mark?
SEAN.
We were just talkin' about you,Ash.
We're on for tonight?"
1738,ASHLEIGH,1738,Yeah.
1739,(TO MARK),1739,This came in for you.
1740,MARK,1740,"You can put it on my desk.
ASHLEIGH puts the small package on Mark's desk."
1741,SEAN,1741,"She's 19, I can't he.lp it, But I'll tell
you what--after tonight.she's yours. in
fact, I'm. gonna get' you in with all sorts
of girls you wouldn't have met before."
1742,(CALLING OUT),1742,Mackey!
1743,"MACKEY
(CALLING BACK)",1743,Yes sir!
1744,SEAN,1744,Refresh!
1745,MARK,1745,"(blandly to SEAN)
You'd do that for me?
MACKEY hits the ""refresh"" key and the big screen shows--
1,000,002
CHEERS erupts throughout the place. SEAN grabs MARK and hugs
him but MARK doesn't quite hug back--he's still hearing what
SEAN just said."
1746,CUT TO:,1746,153.
1747,CUT TO:,1747,"We can hear the thumping music coming 'from the party inside
and college kids have spilled out onto the front lawn of this
pristine, four-columned house."
1748,CUT TO:,1748,"It's dark but we can make out people dancing. The place is
packed."
1749,UT TO,1749,"We hear the thumping music from the party. SEAN's in there
with a couple of guys, ASHLEIGH and another GIRL. SEAN's got
his cell phone out and will snap a picture every once in a
while."
1750,GIRL,1750,I can't find a mirror.
1751,GUY,1751,Do it on anything. You can use a CD.
1752,ASHLEIGH,1752,"Do it off this.
ASHLEIGH's sat on the bed and unbuttoned her top so that she's
in just a bra. She's offering her chest as a surface off of
which to snort cocaine."
1753,GIRL,1753,"Alright!
The GIRL taps out some coke from a vial onto ASHLEIGH's chest
and starts passing around a rolled up 20-dollar bill for
everyone to have a turn and she herself will unbutton her
shirt too for the same purpose. All this while SEAN is
talking,"
1754,SEAN,1754,"The next transformative development? A
picture sharing application. A place
where you view pictures that coincide
with your social life. It is the
true... digitalization of real life. You
don't just go to a party anymore, you go
to a party with your digital camera and
your friends relive the party on
Facebook. And tagging. The idea that you
could tag anyone you wanted in those
pictures so that people could find
themselves. Then a digital log of every
change in a person's life, broadcast to
all their friends instantaneously.
154,"
1755,ASHLEIGH,1755,Would this be easier without the bra?
1756,GUY,1756,"It's worth finding out.
The girls start happily slipping off their bras--
.SEAN
I've spent hours--"
1757,ASHLEIGH,1757,Why has the music stopped?
1758,SEAN,1758,"I've spent hours watching what people do
when they log on."
1759,ASHLEIGH,1759,"Seriously, why has the music stopped?
ASHLEIGH has a point. The music stopped in the addle of
SEAN's speech and the sound outside from the party just
doesn't sound like a party anymore."
1760,SEAN,1760,"flow they always checked their friends'
status updates, checked to see which of
their friends had changed their profiles,
changed their photos and mostly...We
lived on farms, then we lived in cities
and now we're gonna live on the internet."
1761,- ASHLEIGH,1761,"Sean. Stop. Something's going on
downstairs,
SEAN stops talking-he senses it too now.
SEAN walks out of the room to the--
INT, STAIRCASE LANDING - CONTINUOUS
And out the window he sees a fleet of police cars with their
lights flashing parked in front of the house. Then before he
can react, the front door flies open--
POLICE with flashlights walk in--the beams of light streaking
across the darkened party floor and the faces..
We HEAR muffled murmurs from the cops of ""party's over"" and
""step to the side"" and ""nobody's leaving just yet"", etc.
SEAN bolts back into--
155."
1762,- ASHLEIGH,1762,--leaving the door open.
1763,SEAN,1763,"It's the cops.
And they all spring into action. The girls are putting their
bras back on, SEAN is wiping down a night table with the palm
of his hand to get the coke dust off."
1764,"SEAN (CONT'D)
POLICEMAN",1764,"What's goin' on?
They turn to see TWO POLICEMEN standing in the doorway, their
flashlights scanning the room and hitting SEAN's eyes."
1765,"SEAN
(BEAT)",1765,"We're sorry, was the music too loud?
We've got kind of a celebration going."
1766,POLICEMAN,1766,"Ladies, I need you to put your shirts on."
1767,SEAN,1767,"I can have them turn the music down.
One of the policemen casually takes SEAN's hand and sees that
his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard. The
cop uses his finger to taste what it is."
1768,SEAN (CONT'D),1768,"Yeah, that isn't mine."
1769,POLICEMAN,1769,"Okay, could you all stay where you are.
And the handcuffs start to come out and we've got a room of
terrified children.
GIRL,
Wait, can we just talk for a second?
We start to move in on SEAM...
150."
1770,"POLICEMAN
(TO SEAN)",1770,"You got anything in your pockets I need
to know about?"
1771,SEAN,1771,No sir.
1772,- POLICEMAN,1772,"Don't be stupid now,"
1773,SEAN,1773,I don It.
1774,POLICEMAN,1774,"(out of SEAN's shirt pocket)
What's this?"
1775,SEAN,1775,"It's an Epipen,"
1776,POLICEMAN,1776,And this?
1777,SEAN,1777,That's my inhaler.
1778,POLICEMAN #2,1778,"Ladies, how old are you?"
1779,GIRL,1779,I'm 20.
1780,ASHLEIGH,1780,"I'm 19,"
1781,POLICEMAN,1781,Lying makes â¢ i_'E worse.
1782,ASHLEIGH,1782,"I'm 17, I-'m sorry, I shouldn't have lied.
SEAN closes. his eyes at hearing this news as we HEAR the sound
of the-cuffs lock around his wrists and we"
1783,CUT TO:,1783,"A digital LED clock on the wall tells us it's 4:40AM.
MARK is sitting at his computer alone. No one else is in the
office. The San Francisco skyline is beautiful outside the
floor-to-ceiling glass.
His cell phone RINGS and he answers.
1. 57."
1784,"MARK
(INTO PHONE)",1784,Hello?
1785,INTERCUT WITH:,1785,"SEAN, freezing with no coat on, is sitting on the bottom of
the steps to the police station.'The LAWYER we've seen before
is standing in back of him."
1786,"SEAN
(INTO PHONE)",1786,"Listen, something's happened.
We see MARK listening on his end but can't hear SEAN's end of
the conversation."
1787,"MARK
(PAUSE)",1787,Shit.
1788,SEAN,1788,"It's alright, it's gonna be alright. I've
posted bond-and I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies so I can't----
We're back on MARK's side. He listens... listens..."
1789,MARK,1789,"17?
Back on SEAN's side-"
1790,SEAN,1790,"I think it was Moritz. I swear, I think
it was Michael Moritz."
1791,"MARK
(EVENLY)",1791,"This is gonna be news, Sean, it's gonna.
be online any second."
1792,"SEAN
(BEAT)",1792,I know.
1793,"MARK
(BLANK)",1793,You know with anunderage intern and--
1794,SEAN,1794,"It's cool, I've got it under control.
158,"
1795,"MARK
(NO PANIC)",1795,"I'll get it under control. I'll call our
guys and see what the next move is. But
this is gonna be news now."
1796,SEAN,1796,"You think it was Moritz? 'Cause I do. And
I'm gonna meet that guy in a dark alley
one night. Or Eduardo? Did Eduardo have
me followed?"
1797,MARK,1797,"(cool as ice)
Go home, Sean. I'll call our people.
MARK clicks the phone shut. He sits there a moment.
He looks at the small package. that Ashleigh dropped on his
desk earlier. He opens up the brown paper wrapping and there's
a box.
He opens the box--a thousand brand new business cards. He
takes one of the business cards out and looks at it.
I'm CEO ...Bitoh
And over this we HEAR a woman's voice...
MARYLIN (V.0.)
Mark?"
1798,CUT TO:,1798,"MARK is sitting alone.-in the conference room. The only one
left is MARYL?N,whose voï¿½.ce we just. heard. The lightp of the
San Francisco skyline fill the huge picture windows."
1799,MARYLIN,1799,"Mark?
MARK looks up at her..."
1800,MARYLIN (CONT'D),1800,"Everyone's gone,
MARK doesn't say anything..."
1801,MARYLIN (CONT'D),1801,"We're done for the day,"
1802,"MARK
(PAUSE)",1802,"Who would you rather he?
159."
1803,MARYLIN,1803,I'm sorry?
1804,MARK,1804,My lawyer or their lawyer?
1805,"MARYLIN
(SMILES)",1805,"Something tells me over the long run
there's more money in being your lawyer.
What happened to Sean?"
1806,MAIM,1806,"He cashed out most of his stock. Hey
listen, all you had all day was that
salad. You want to get something to eat?"
1807,MARYLIN,1807,I can't.
1808,MARK,1808,I'm not a bad guy.
1809,MARYLIN,1809,I know that. I like you.
1810,MARK,1810,What happens now?
1811,MARYLIN,1811,"Sy and the rest of them are at the Palm
having a steak. Then they'll come back, up
to the office and start working on a
settlement agreement to present to you."
1812,MARK,1812,They're gonna want to settle?
1813,MARYLIN,1813,"Oh yeah. And you're gonna have to pay
some bonus money too."
1814,MARK,1814,Why?
1815,MARYLIN,1815,"'Cause you're gonna need these guys to
sign a non-disclosure agreement and
you're gonna need to be indemnified. They
say one unflattering word about you in
public and you own their house, wife and
kids."
1816,MARK,1816,"I invented Facebook.
160."
1817,MARYLIN,1817,"I'm talking about what a jury'll see.
.That's what I do, that's what I'm doing
here. I'm trying to specialize in voir
dire--jury selection. Clothes, hair,
wedding ring, speaking style, likability--"
1818,MARK,1818,Likability?
1819,MARYLIN,1819,"I've been licensed to practice law for
all of-20 months and I could get a jury
to believe you planted the story about
Eduardo. You know how? Just by asking the
question. Watch. Why weren't you at the
sorority party that night?"
1820,MARK,1820,"You think I'm the one who called the
police?"
1821,MARYLIN -,1821,"Doesn't matter, I asked the question and
now everybody's thinking about it. You
lost the jury in the first 10 minutes."
1822,"MARK
(PAUSE)",1822,"Farm animals?
.MARYLIN
Yeah,"
1823,MARK,1823,I was drunk and angry and stupid.
1824,MARYLIN,1824,And blogging.
1825,(PAUSE),1825,"Pay the fine. Get your parking validated.
Get out of it. That's what Sy and the
guys'll tell you in the morning."
1826,MARK,1826,"Would anyone mind it I stayed and used
the computer for a minute?"
1827,MARYLIN,1827,"No. There's a night guy downstairs. Stay
as long as you want."
1828,MARK,1828,"Thanks. I appreciate your help today,"
1829,MARYLIN,1829,"You're not an asshole, Mark. You just
want to be.
161.
MARYI,IN, who's been putting on her coat, takes her briefcase
and exits.
MARK sits down at the computer. He logs on to Facebook.
He -types a name in the-search box: ""Erica Albright"".
Erica's name and picture come up, along with Boston
University, '07. Mark smiles. She's on Facebook.
He moves the mouse back and forth between two boxes: ""Send a
Message."" and ""Add as a Friend"".
He clicks on ""Add as a Friend"".
A box comes up that reads: ""Your request to add Erica Albright
as a friend has been sent.""
Then MARK clicks to his homepage and waits for the response.
And waits..."
