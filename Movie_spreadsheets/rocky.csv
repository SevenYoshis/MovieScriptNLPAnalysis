more moths than flies -- An'
the moths get caught in my
turtle's throat -- That makes

I was sayin', the moths get
caught in the turtle's throat
an' makes 'em cough..."
57,ROCKY,57,"A little cough an' I gotta

69,OWNER,69,"We're not responsible for

animal shelter, Y'know.
...Adrian, I want you to clean
all those cat cages downstairs,
they're a mess."
70,ROCKY,70,"He only had a hundred an'

77,GAZZO,77,"Yo Rock.  Did I give you a job
this mornin?  How come ya
didn't break this guy's thumb
like I asked ya?  When ya
don't do what ya are told, it
makes me look bad, kid."
78,ROCKY,78,"I figure if I break the thumb
this guy gets thrown outta his
job and can't pay nothin no
more."
79,GAZZO,79,"It don't matter.  It's my
reputation.  These guys think
they can get off light.  It's
bad for my reputation -- It's
bad for business.  See ya
killer."
80,GAZZO,80,... The Rock's a good kid.
81,BODYGUARD,81,... A meatbag.
82,RUDY,82,...See the fight last night?
83,RUDY,83,"Nah, I was fightin' myself."
84,RUDY,84,"Apollo Creed beat the bum to
pieces."
85,FIGHTER #1,85,"Hey, hear ya knocked Spider
Rice out in the sixth?"
86,ROCKY,86,The third -- Shoulda seen it.
87,FIGHTER #2,87,"Hey, Rock, touch my hand."
88,ROCKY,88,How come?
89,FIGHTER #2,89,"C'mon, it's important."
90,FIGHTER #2,90,Can ya tell I just whacked-off?
91,ROCKY,91,... These ain't my clothes.
92,ROCKY,92,... These ain't my pictures.
93,ROCKY,93,"Yo, Mike -- What's happenin'
here?"
94,MIKE,94,It ain't your locker no more.
95,ROCKY,95,"Whatta ya talkin' about it

97,FIGHTER,97,"...Hey, Peanut, gimme some

98,MIKE,98,"Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you,
Nobody -- You don't call me
Peanut."
99,FIGHTER,99,"Peanut, gimme some soap."
100,ROCKY,100,"You were ready to bite that
guy's face."
101,MIKE,101,"Yeah -- See the fight last
night?  Apollo Creed beat that
English guy bad."
102,ROCKY,102,Creed's great.
103,MICKEY,103,"I don't care what nobody says,
this bum Creed woulda never
made it in the Thirties --"
104,ROCKY,104,"Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?"
105,MICKEY,105,... What?
106,ROCKY,106,"I said, how ya feelin'?"
107,MICKEY,107,Do you see me talkin'?  Huh?
108,ROCKY,108,Yeah.
109,MICKEY,109,"Then stand there an' wait till
I'm done -- Creed's good,
yeah, he's real fine but I
gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper,
who's got the stuff it takes

d'ya need?  Okay, go to work..."
110,MICKEY,110,Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
111,ROCKY,111,"I was talkin' with ya man,
Mike. -- Hey, how come I been
put outta my locker?"
112,MICKEY,112,Dipper needed it.
113,MICKEY,113,"Dipper's a climber -- You're a
tomato."
114,ROCKY,114,... Tomato?
115,MICKEY,115,"Facts is facts.  I run a
business here -- I'm cleanin'
house --"
116,MICKEY,116,How old are ya?
117,ROCKY,117,...What?
118,MICKEY,118,How old?
119,ROCKY,119,"Come July, twenty-five."
120,MICKEY,120,More like thirty.
121,ROCKY,121,"Twenty-five, thirty -- What's
the difference? -- It took me
two months to learn the
combination of that locker."
122,MICKEY,122,The legs must be goin'.
123,ROCKY,123,"Yeah, they're goin', -- that's
nature... That was my locker
for six years."
124,MICKEY,124,... Did ya fight last night?
125,ROCKY,125,Yeah --
126,MICKEY,126,Did ya win?
127,ROCKY,127,"Yeah, Kayo."
128,MICKEY,128,... Who'd ya fight?
129,ROCKY,129,Spider Rice.
130,MICKEY,130,Rice is a bum.
131,ROCKY,131,"You think everybody I fight is
a bum."
132,MICKEY,132,Ain't they?
133,MICKEY,133,"Ya want the truth -- Ya got
heart, but ya fight like an
ape -- The only thing special
about you is ya never got ya
nose broke -- keep ya nose
pretty -- what's left of ya
brain an' retire."
134,ROCKY,134,"Listen, I'm gonna take a
steam -- Did good last night --
Shoulda seen it."
135,MICKEY,135,"Hey, ever think about retirin'?"
136,ROCKY,136,...No.
137,MICKEY,137,Think about it.
138,ROCKY,138,"Yeah, sure."
139,ROCKY,139,"...I think I'm gonna take a
steam -- Shoulda seen me
fight -- Did good, y'know."
140,MICKEY,140,"Known him since he was
fifteen -- A waste of life."
141,DIPPER,141,"... I dig yo' locker, Man."
142,TRAINER,142,"Time, Dipper."
143,ROCKY,143,"... Wow -- cold!  Good night
to catch pneumonia."
144,ROCKY,144,"Ah -- I came in here for
somethin'... Oh, yeah, would
ya like somebody to walk ya
home?"
145,ROCKY,145,"Hey, how's my buddy doin'?"
146,ROCKY,146,"-- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see
ya later."
147,ADRIAN,147,"... Goodnight, Rocky."
148,ROCKY,148,"Catch pneumonia out there --
Seen Paulie?"
149,ROCKY,149,"Yo, Paulie."
150,PAULIE,150,"Yo, Rocky -- Look at this
mirror.  I'd like to kill the
friggin' moron who broke this
mirror."
151,ROCKY,151,"Yo, Paulie."
152,PAULIE,152,What?
153,ROCKY,153,"Your sister's givin' me the
shoulder."
154,PAULIE,154,"Forget her.  You could do
better than my sister."
155,ROCKY,155,"Every mornin', every night I
pass by -- I smile."
156,ROCKY (CONT'D),156,"I say jokes.  Nothin'.  She
looks at me."
157,PAULIE,157,"Looks, huh?"
158,ROCKY,158,"Yeah, like I was a plate of
leftovers -- Somethin' wrong
with my face -- Whatta I need,
a Caddy to connect with ya
sister?"
159,PAULIE,159,My sister's a friggin' loser.
160,ROCKY,160,Hey --
161,PAULIE,161,"Sometimes she gets me so
crazy, I'd like to split her
head with a razor."
162,ROCKY,162,"Don't get mental, man."
163,PAULIE,163,Ya caught me in a bad mood.
164,ROCKY,164,Ya always in a bad mood --
165,PAULIE,165,... Adrian ain't sharp.
166,PAULIE,166,"She's a loser -- She don't
enjoy life -- She reads --
Brainy -- Pushin' thirty
friggin' years old!  She's
gonna die alone if she don't
wise up."
167,ROCKY,167,I'm thirty myself.
168,PAULIE,168,"An' you're dyin' alone, too."
169,ROCKY,169,"I don't see no crowd around
you, neither."
170,PAULIE,170,"I wanna kill the friggin'
moron who broke the mirror."
171,ROCKY,171,Let's get outta this stink.
172,PAULIE,172,"The girl's dryin' up!  She's
gotta live a little before her
body dries up!!  You're a pal,
Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to
her?  Y'know, it's Thanksgivin'
tomorrow."
173,ROCKY,173,... Sure.
174,PAULIE,174,"Tomorrow you come for some
bird, right?"
175,ROCKY,175,Absolutely...
176,ANDY,176,"That was alotta crap to go
through for a dinner invite."
177,COMMENTATOR,177,"How was the flight, Champ?"
178,APOLLO,178,Very high an' very fast.
179,COMMENTATOR,179,"Apollo, how would you rate
this last British challenger,
Henry Wilcoxson?"
180,APOLLO,180,"He was big, an' very nasty so
I destroyed him in a hurry --
Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac
Lee Green next month."
181,COMMENTATOR,181,"You're referring to the much
publicized bicentennial fight?"
182,APOLLO,182,"That's right -- It's gonna be
the greatest sportin' event in
this country's history -- A
gala occurrence!"
183,COMMENTATOR,183,"Still to be held in
Philadelphia?"
184,APOLLO,184,"The Bicentennial Heavyweight
Championship of the World is
gonna be held in the only
place it can be held --
Philadelphia! -- the nation's
cradle -- January First -- the
first major event of our two
hundredth year."
185,COMMENTATOR,185,Where're you off to now?
186,APOLLO,186,"Me an' my wife are goin' home
'cause we miss our children
an' can't go no more time
without seein' them."
187,COMMENTATOR,187,"Any quick advice for young
boxing hopefuls?"
188,APOLLO,188,"... Stay in school an' use
your brains, dig -- Be a
lawyer, be a doctor, carry a
leather briefcase an' forget
about sports!!  Sports can
only make ya grunt an' smell --
Be a thinker not a stinker!!"
189,COMMENTATOR,189,"Jerry Simpson at Kennedy
Airport with the Champion,
Apollo Creed."
190,ANDY,190,"Nobody cares what's happenin'
in the world of sports
nomore -- Downhill.  Baseball,
downhill -- Basketball,
downhill.  Football's goin',
too.  Bank on it.  Baseball
use to be America's best
sport... Sure -- Nuttin' like
squattin' through a great
double header, but now
baseball's all business."
191,ANDY,191,"Where are the real fighters?
The pros.  Today we jig clowns."
192,ROCKY,192,Clown.
193,ANDY,193,Yeah.
194,ROCKY,194,"He took his best shot an'
became champ -- What shot did
you ever take?"
195,ANDY,195,"Yo, Rock, you ain't happy with
yourself?  Fine.  But me, I
gotta business here -- I don't
need to take no shot."
196,ANDY,196,"Take a shot, he says! -- Sure,
I'll take a shot!"
197,CHIPPED TOOTH,197,"Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man."
198,ROCKY,198,"... No wine -- Bad for ya'
brain."
199,CHIPPED TOOTH,199,"C'mon, man, it's cold, man."
200,ROCKY,200,No wine.
201,CHIPPED TOOTH,201,"Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar."
202,ROCKY,202,Why?
203,CHIPPED TOOTH,203,"'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme
a dollar."
204,ROCKY,204,No dollar.
205,CHIPPED TOOTH,205,"Hey, give Rocky a dime."
206,YOUNG MAN #2,206,... How come?
207,CHIPPED TOOTH,207,So he can call all his friends.
208,ROCKY,208,... That's an old one.
209,CHIPPED TOOTH,209,"Buy us some Thunderbird, man."
210,ROCKY,210,"Is that Marie? -- Marie, ya
brother know you're hangin'
out so late?"
211,MARIE,211,... Screw you.
212,ROCKY,212,What'd you say?
213,MARIE,213,"... Screw you, yoyo."
214,ROCKY,214,"Did these guys teach you to
talk dirty?  Huh?"
215,MARIE,215,Hey --
216,ROCKY,216,What?
217,MARIE,217,"Stuff it, man!"
218,ROCKY,218,Don't you never say that --
219,ROCKY,219,"-- You guys talk like that in
front of a little girl -- You
guys are scum."
220,CHIPPED TOOTH,220,"This is our place, dig!"
221,ROCKY,221,"Don't ya never come round this
girl -- Go home."
222,YOUNG MAN #2,222,"This is our corner, man!  You
go, chump!"
223,CHIPPED TOOTH,223,"We'll kill you, man -- We
gotta gun."
224,ROCKY,224,"Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent
ya face!"
225,ROCKY,225,"How come ya wanna hang out
with those guys?  They teach
ya bad things."
226,MARIE,226,"I like 'em.  If you don't you
can f--"
227,ROCKY,227,"Hey!  When I was your age,
there was only one girl who
talked like that in the whole
neighborhood."
228,MARIE,228,... Yeah.
229,ROCKY,229,Make your teeth yella --
230,MARIE,230,I like yella teeth.
231,ROCKY,231,Makes your breath like garbage.
232,MARIE,232,Maybe I like garbage.
233,ROCKY,233,"Nobody likes garbage --
Anyway, this girl with the
dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin',
but the guys wouldn't take her
out for any serious datin'."
234,MARIE,234,Why?
235,ROCKY,235,"'Cause that's the way guys
are -- They laugh when ya talk
dirty.  They think ya cute for
a while, but then ya getta
reputation an' watch out."
236,ROCKY (CONT'D),236,"Nobody's ever gonna take ya
serious.  Ya get no respect...
I gotta use a bad word --
Whore.  You'll end up maybe
becomin' a whore."
237,MARIE,237,"C'mon, Rocky.  I'm twelve."
238,ROCKY,238,"That doesn't matter -- You
don't really have to be a
whore, just act like one an'
that's it."
239,MARIE,239,What?
240,ROCKY,240,"Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty
years from now people will say
'D'you remember Marie?' 'No,
who was she?' 'She was that
little whore who hung out at
the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh,
now I remember!'... See, they
don't remember you, they
remember the rep."
241,ROCKY,241,"... That's your house, ain't it?"
242,ROCKY,242,"Listen, I hope ya don't --"
243,MARIE,243,I won't.
244,ROCKY,244,What was I gonna say?
245,MARIE,245,"Ya hope I don't keep acting
like a whore or I'll turn into
one, right?"
246,ROCKY,246,"Ya, somethin' like that."
247,MARIE,247,"Goodnight, Rocky."
248,ROCKY,248,"'Night, Marie."
249,MARIE,249,"... Fuck you, Creepo!!!"
250,ROCKY,250,"... Yeah, who're you to give
advice, Creepo."
251,LAWYER,251,"Are the doctor's reports
confirmed?"
252,JERGENS,252,Definitely --
253,JERGENS,253,"-- It says here, Mac Lee Green
has suffered a seriously
cracked third metacarpal in
his left hand."
254,APOLLO,254,Damn.
255,JERGENS,255,"I suppose we could cancel the
fight indefinitely if you are
set on fighting Green."
256,TRAINER,256,"It ain't just Green, what
about the time Apollo's
invested --"
257,JERGENS,257,"I believe we can find a
solution."
258,APOLLO,258,"Solution, nothin' -- What
about the Bicentennial fight."
259,LAWYER,259,"Jergens, don't play games with
my client!  Apollo has already
done nearly a million dollars
worth of publicity --"
260,TRAINER,260,Ten million's worth!
261,LAWYER,261,"-- And has made contractual
obligations with over twenty
different organizations -- He
doesn't want to be embarrassed."
262,APOLLO,262,"You best find me another
ranked contender an' I mean in
a flash, man!"
263,JERGENS,263,"I contacted Ernie Roman's
manager, he's fighting in
France the same week."
264,APOLLO,264,"Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's
ranked fifth."
265,JERGENS,265,"Shaw's fighting in South
America -- Why not postpone
the bout until July Fourth?"
266,LAWYER,266,"Hell with Fourth of July, man!
Ten thousand things'll be
goin' down on the Fourth of
July! -- Apollo wants to be
first!"
267,JERGENS,267,"That may not be possible, Jimmy."
268,TRAINER,268,"This man here is the Star,
dig -- Don't cause him to
breathe heavy -- Now what
'bout that sucker, Billy Dukes?"
269,JERGENS,269,"Went to California and gained
fifty pounds -- and I called
every worthwhile contender,
but they say five weeks isn't
enough time to get in shape."
270,APOLLO,270,"Shape, nothin' -- They're
afraid.  They know everybody
in the world's gonna see this
fight an' none of them gotta
prayer of beating me so
they're makin' excuses so they
don't have to be the chump
that's gonna be whipped in
front of the whole civilized
world!!"
271,JERGENS,271,"Apollo, I'm sure there's a way
to salvage this."
272,TRAINER,272,"Nobody wants to be dissected
on the country's birthday."
273,JERGENS,273,"All I can counter with is that
I'm a goddamn good promoter --
I've promoted in every country
in the world -- and I've tried
to the best of my abilities.
Perhaps you're right, and no
one wants to be beat on the
country's birthday... I don't
know what else to say --"
274,APOLLO,274,"I do -- Maybe what this fight
needs is something new -- a
novelty."
275,TRAINER,275,"You's the novelty, Champ!"
276,APOLLO,276,Give my main man a raise!!
277,APOLLO,277,"Now here's what's goin' down.
Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say
this but one time.  On January
first, the first day of the
Bicentennial I'm gonna fight
me a local poor underdog, dig?
A snow-white underdog.  An'
I'm gonna put his face on this
poster with me, hear?  An'
I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm
sentimental -- An' all the
people in the country all
sentimental, man, an' they'd
like nothin' better than me,
Apollo Creed, to let some
unknown get a shot at the
greatest title in the world on
this country's biggest birthday.
Now that's the way I see it
an' that's the way I want it!!"
278,JERGENS,278,... It's very American.
279,APOLLO,279,"No, man, it's very smart."
280,ROCKY,280,"Next Wednesday I grab a grand
from Snyder.  An' Thursday two
yards from Cappoli, okay?"
281,GAZZO,281,"No, two yards from Snyder, an'
a grand from Cappoli."
282,ROCKY,282,Ya sure?
283,GAZZO,283,"Hey, screw ya brain on right.
Now, who's this girl you're
going out with tonight?"
284,ROCKY,284,How'd you know?
285,GAZZO,285,You think I don't hear things?
286,ROCKY,286,Paulie's sister.
287,BODYGUARD,287,Hear she's retarded.
288,ROCKY,288,"She ain't retarded, she's shy."
289,BODYGUARD,289,"Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards
like the zoo."
290,ROCKY,290,Does that bum have to say that?
291,GAZZO,291,"Buddy's in a bad mood --
prostate problems."
292,ROCKY,292,He's always in a bad mood.
293,ROCKY,293,"Count ya blessin's.  Ya a
healthy person -- ya legs
work -- ya hands work --"
294,BODYGUARD,294,I don't like ya face.
295,ROCKY,295,Don't like yours neither.
296,BODYGUARD,296,Kiss my ass.
297,ROCKY,297,Move your shoulders down.
298,GAZZO,298,"Buddy's got a thing against
ya, Rock.  Some people just
hate for no reason, y'know."
299,ROCKY,299,Yeah.
300,GAZZO,300,"Here's fifty bucks -- You an'
the girl have a nice time."
301,ROCKY,301,"Thanks, Mr. Gazzo."
302,APOLLO,302,How 'bout this Billy Snow?
303,JERGENS,303,Fouls.
304,APOLLO,304,How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
305,TRAINER,305,"Too old, dull fighter."
306,TRAINER,306,Bobby Judge is a good boy.
307,APOLLO,307,"... I don't feel heat from the
name."
308,JERGENS,308,"Joe Zack is a good prospect --
Exciting boy."
309,APOLLO,309,... Still don't feel no heat.
310,JERGENS,310,"Exactly what are you looking
for, Apollo?"
311,APOLLO,311,... This man.
312,APOLLO,312,"'The Italian Stallion' -- He's
my man."
313,JERGENS,313,"Rocky Balboa -- His record's
poor --"
314,APOLLO,314,"Don't matter -- That name.
'The Italian Stallion,' it's
right on."
315,APOLLO,315,"Who discovered America?  An
Italian, right?  So, man, what
could be better than to get it
on with one of his ancestors --"
316,TRAINER,316,He won't last one round.
317,APOLLO,317,"Listen, I gonna carry this boy
three rounds, then drop 'im
like a bad habit."
318,TRAINER,318,"I don't like you messin' with
southpaws -- They do everything
wrong."
319,APOLLO,319,"Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop
'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed
meets the Italian Stallion.'
Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn
monster movie!!"
320,ROCKY,320,I usta be deadly at half-ball.
321,PAULIE,321,"I hate the friggin' game...
I'd like to talk some business."
322,ROCKY,322,What kinda business?
323,PAULIE,323,"Look at my hands -- See how
the joints are swollen."
324,PAULIE,324,"Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in
an' out of a freezer carryin'
meat plays hell on the joints."
325,ROCKY,325,Maybe ya should see a doctor.
326,PAULIE,326,"I don't need a doctor, I need
a different job."
327,ROCKY,327,"Maybe another job is the best
thing."
328,PAULIE,328,"Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo.
Tell him I'm a friend an'
would do a good job... Tell
him I ain't bothered by
nothin' an' would be a great
collector... Bustin' bones
don't bother me -- Tell him
I'm a good worker."
329,ROCKY,329,Gazzo's gotta come to you.
330,PAULIE,330,"I'm askin' ya to go to him --
As a favor."
331,ROCKY,331,"Gazzo's gotta come to you --
Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job --
Do what you do now."
332,PAULIE,332,You know her?
333,ROCKY,333,Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
334,PAULIE,334,"Yeah, sure -- She's very
excited."
335,ADRIAN,335,"Paulie, you're late."
336,PAULIE,336,Did you call the hospital?
337,PAULIE,337,"If I'm ten minutes late, she
calls the hospital."
338,COMMENTATOR (V.O.),338,"... Unfortunate luck for
fifth-ranked heavyweight, Mac
Lee Green.  The slugging
fighter acquired a serious
fracture in his left hand
after an aggressive day of
sparring -- Champion Apollo
Creed says he'll be 'shopping
for another victim,' to fill
Green's vacancy for the
Bicentennial Championship
Fight to be held in Philly
next month... By the way,
rumor has it that this will be
the most widely-viewed sporting
event in the entire world --
and that includes the Super
Bowl, folks... Today U.S.
swimmers set a new..."
339,ADRIAN,339,"... Paulie, why didn't you
tell me you were bringing him
home?!  Look at me, I'm not
ready for this."
340,PAULIE,340,"Like it would make a difference
if you were, right?  This
guy's a friend and now he's
takin' ya out."
341,ADRIAN,341,No... I can't!
342,PAULIE,342,"Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom
an' I don't wanna know from
nothin'."
343,ADRIAN,343,"Paulie, please --"
344,PAULIE,344,"Hey, I want ya out
instamaticly. -- I'm sicka
lookin' at ya hangin' around
like a friggin' spider -- Go
out -- Live!  Do, enjoy life."
345,ADRIAN,345,... Like you?
346,PAULIE,346,"Don't get wise with me.  I
want ya to stop bein' a loser."
347,ADRIAN,347,I can't go out.
348,PAULIE,348,Why?
349,ADRIAN,349,"Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
I've gotta turkey in the oven."
350,PAULIE,350,"!! Ya want the bird, go out in
the alley an' eat the bird --
I want ya outta the house --
Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya
hungry, Rock?"
351,ROCKY,351,Maybe ya better forget it.
352,PAULIE,352,"Forget nothin' -- Here, talk
to my sister, tell 'er
somethin' nice."
353,ROCKY,353,"... Yo, Adrian, it's me,
Rocky... Ah, ah -- Ah, it's
kinda hard for me to think of
somethin' to say, y'know --
'Cause I never talked to a
door before, I mean whatta ya
say to a door."
354,ROCKY,354,... Maybe I better forget it.
355,PAULIE,355,"Try again, c'mon, try again."
356,ROCKY,356,"Ah, Adrian, I know ya ain't
too happy at this moment, but
would ya do me a favor -- I
ain't got nobody to spend
Thanksgivin' with -- How 'bout
you an' me goin' out -- Get
somethin' to eat, maybe laugh
a little, who knows... Would
ya like, I dunno, go out
together?"
357,ROCKY,357,We'll have a good time.
358,ROCKY,358,What's ya sister like to do?
359,PAULIE,359,Ice skate.
360,ROCKY,360,I didn't want no turkey anyway.
361,ADRIAN,361,It's Thanksgiving.
362,ROCKY,362,"To you, to me it's Thursday."
363,ROCKY,363,"Looks quiet, y'know."
364,ADRIAN,364,I think it's closed.
365,ROCKY,365,"I think mebbe we're early or
somethin' --"
366,CLEANER,366,"Hey, whatta ya doin' here --
we're closed... Yo, we're
closed!"
367,ROCKY,367,"Are ya closed to the General
Public or to just everybody."
368,CLEANER,368,"Hey, the rink is empty 'cause
we're closed -- ya ain't
allowed in here so do me a
favor an' not stay here."
369,ROCKY,369,"Wait here, gotta smooth this
guy out."
370,ADRIAN,370,"We could go somewhere else
an' --"
371,CLEANER,371,"Yo, pal, what's with you --
The place ain't operatin'."
372,ROCKY,372,"Listen, I gotta problem.  This
girl ain't feelin' well,
y'know -- The doctor says she
should exercise, y'know once
in awhile an' ice skatin' is
the best thing --"
373,CLEANER,373,This a con?
374,ROCKY,374,"Look at her, ya can see she
ain't feelin' good -- needs a
few minutes exercise --"
375,CLEANER,375,Few minutes?
376,ROCKY,376,... Ten minutes.
377,CLEANER,377,Ten minutes for ten dollars.
378,ROCKY,378,"... Yeah, give 'er the Blades."
379,ADRIAN,379,... Aren't you skating?
380,ROCKY,380,"Ain't skated since I was
fifteen -- That's when I
started fightin' -- gotta
watch the ankles.  Yeah,
fightin' use to be tops with
me, but no more.  All I wanted
to prove was I weren't no
bum -- That I had the stuff to
make a good pro."
381,ADRIAN,381,And you never got the chance?
382,CLEANER,382,Nine minutes!
383,ROCKY,383,"Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still
fight.  Kinda do it like a
hobby.  See I'm a natural
southpaw an' most pugs won't
fight a southpaw 'cause we
mess up their timin' an' look
awkward -- Southpaw means
lefthanded... But I guess in
the long run things probably
worked out for the best, right?"
384,ADRIAN,384,"But you never had a chance to
prove yourself."
385,ROCKY,385,Absolutely.
386,CLEANER,386,Eight minutes!
387,ROCKY,387,I just dislocated my finger.
388,ADRIAN,388,Ohh!
389,CLEANER,389,Seven minutes!
390,ROCKY,390,"It ain't your fault -- I
originally done it in the Baby
Crenshaw fight."
391,ROCKY,391,"That's me fightin' Big Baby
Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the
size of an airplane an' I
broke my hands on his head --
I lost, but it's a nice
picture, don't ya think?"
392,CLEANER,392,Six!
393,ROCKY,393,How 'bout some Cokes?
394,CLEANER,394,Cost ya a buck.
395,ROCKY,395,"This guy is beautiful -- get
the Cokes."
396,ROCKY,396,"See, I ain't graceful,
y'know -- I don't move good --
Stink as a dancer too -- But I
can really swat, I hit hard,		real hard, but I'm a southpaw
an' nobody wants to fight a
southpaw! -- Havin' a good time?"
397,ROCKY,397,"Y'know how I got started in
the fight racket?"
398,ADRIAN,398,By accident?
399,CLEANER,399,Here -- Three minutes.
400,ROCKY,400,"Yeah -- My ol' man who was
never the sharpest told me --
I weren't born with much brain
so I better use my body."
401,ROCKY,401,What's funny?
402,ADRIAN,402,"My mother told me just the
opposite.  She said, 'You
weren't born with much of a
body so you'd better develop
your brain.'"
403,CLEANER,403,Time!
404,CLEANER,404,That's ten bucks.
405,ROCKY,405,"I must be goin' deaf 'cause I
thought ya said, 'ten cents.'"
406,CLEANER,406,... How 'bout for the Cokes?
407,ROCKY,407,Charge it.
408,ROCKY,408,"Had ya goin', didn't I, huh?"
409,ROCKY,409,"Some people are very shy by
nature."
410,ADRIAN,410,... I suppose.
411,ROCKY,411,"I would say you're very shy bu
nature."
412,ADRIAN,412,... I suppose.
413,ROCKY,413,"Some people think bein' shy is
a disease, but it don't bother
me."
414,ADRIAN,414,It doesn't bother me either.
415,ROCKY,415,"Then why did I bother bringin'
it up?  'Cause I'm dumb,
that's why... Y'know, I think
we make a real sharp coupla
coconuts -- I'm dumb an'
you're shy."
416,ADRIAN,416,"... It is just hard for me to
understand why anybody wants
to be a fighter."
417,ROCKY,417,"Ya gotta be a little soft to
wanna be a pug... It's a
racket where ya' almost
guaranteed to end up a bum."
418,ADRIAN,418,I don't think you're a bum.
419,ROCKY,419,"... I'm at least half a bum.
Yeah, fightin' is a crazy
racket.  The roughest part is
the mornin' after."
420,ADRIAN,420,Morning after?
421,ROCKY,421,"After a rough fight, ya'
nothin' but a large wound.
Sometimes I feel like callin'
a taxi to drive me from my bed
to the bathroom... Ya' eyes
hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair
even hurts... But the thing
I'm proud of is I been in over
sixty fights an' never had a
busted nose -- Bent an'
twisted an' bitten but never
broke... That's rare."
422,ADRIAN,422,"Why do you do it if it hurts
so bad?"
423,ROCKY,423,... Guess.
424,ADRIAN,424,'Cause you can't sing or dance?
425,ROCKY,425,Would ya like a glass of water?
426,ADRIAN,426,... No thanks.
427,ROCKY,427,"Here's the guys I was tellin'
ya about -- This is Cuff an'
Link."
428,ADRIAN,428,I sold them to you.
429,ROCKY,429,"... Oh, yeah, I bought the
whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me
the turtles, the bowl, an' the
mountain -- I had to get rid
of the mountain 'cause they
kept fallin' off."
430,ADRIAN,430,Do you have a phone?
431,ROCKY,431,"I had it pulled.  People
callin' all the time.  Who
needs it -- Who'd you wanna
call?"
432,ADRIAN,432,"I wanna let my brother know
where I am."
433,ROCKY,433,D'you really wanna call?
434,ADRIAN,434,"Yes, I do."
435,ROCKY,435,You sure?
436,ADRIAN,436,Yes.
437,ROCKY,437,Why?
438,ADRIAN,438,I think he might be worried.
439,ROCKY,439,I'll call your brother.
440,ROCKY,440,"!!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's
with me!  I'll call ya later."
441,ROCKY,441,"What's the matter?  Ya don't
like the room?"
442,ADRIAN,442,It's fine.
443,ROCKY,443,It's only temporary.
444,ADRIAN,444,It's not that --
445,ROCKY,445,"What's the problem?  You don't
like me -- Don't like the
turtles -- What is it?"
446,ADRIAN,446,I don't think I belong here.
447,ROCKY,447,It's okay.
448,ADRIAN,448,"No, I don't belong here."
449,ROCKY,449,"It's all right -- You're my
guest."
450,ADRIAN,450,"... I've never been in a man's
apartment before."
451,ROCKY,451,They're all the same.
452,ADRIAN,452,"I'm not sure I know you well
enough -- I don't think I'm
comfortable."
453,ROCKY,453,"Yo, I'm not comfortable either."
454,ADRIAN,454,I should leave.
455,ROCKY,455,"But I'm willin' to make the
best of this uncomfortable
situation."
456,ROCKY,456,Would ya take off your glasses?
457,ADRIAN,457,What?
458,ROCKY,458,The glasses... Please.
459,ADRIAN,459,... T-thank you.
460,ROCKY,460,Do me another favor?
461,ADRIAN,461,... What?
462,ROCKY,462,Could ya take off that hat.
463,ROCKY,463,I always knew you was pretty.
464,ADRIAN,464,Don't tease me.
465,ROCKY,465,"I wanna kiss ya -- Ya don't
have to kiss me back if ya
don't feel like it."
466,MIKE,466,"Hey, Rock -- What happened?"
467,ROCKY,467,'Bout what?
468,MICKEY,468,"Did ya get the message, kid?"
469,ROCKY,469,Message -- What message?
470,MICKEY,470,"A Rep from Miles Jergens'
Promotions was lookin' for
ya -- They need sparrin'
partners for Creed."
471,ROCKY,471,Ya puttin' me on?
472,MICKEY,472,Here's the card?
473,ROCKY,473,When was they here?
474,MICKEY,474,'Bout an hour ago.
475,ROCKY,475,"Probably lookin' for sparrin'
partners."
476,MICKEY,476,... I said that before.
477,MICKEY,477,... Waste of life.
478,SECRETARY,478,May I help you?
479,SECRETARY,479,"Your name, please?"
480,ROCKY,480,"Balboa, Rocky Balboa."
481,SECRETARY,481,You may go in.
482,JERGENS,482,"Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles
Jergens -- Please, have a seat."
483,ROCKY,483,... Thanks.
484,JERGENS,484,Mr. Balboa --
485,ROCKY,485,Rocky.
486,JERGENS,486,"Rocky, do you have any
representation?  A manager?"
487,ROCKY,487,No -- Just me.
488,JERGENS,488,"Rocky, would you be interested
in --"
489,ROCKY,489,Sparrin'?
490,JERGENS,490,Excuse me.
491,ROCKY,491,"I know ya need sparrin'
partners -- I'm very available."
492,JERGENS,492,I'm sure you are.
493,ROCKY,493,"Absolutely -- Sparrin' with
the Champ would be an honor --
y'know what?"
494,JERGENS,494,What?
495,ROCKY,495,"I wouldn't take no cheap shots.
I'd be a good sparrin' partner."
496,JERGENS,496,"Rocky, would you be interested
in fighting Apollo Creed for
the Championship?"
497,ROCKY,497,"... Like I said, I'd make a
boss sparrin' mate."
498,JERGENS,498,Did you hear what I said?
499,ROCKY,499,"Sure, an' I'm smart enough to
know that no sparrin' partner
should take cheap shots at the
Champ.  He's just there to
help condition the man."
500,JERGENS,500,"Not spar, I'm asking whether
you would be interested in
fighting Creed for the
championship."
501,ROCKY,501,... Ah... Absolutely.
502,REPORTER #1,502,"How'd you like the 'City of
Brotherly Love?'"
503,APOLLO,503,"I like my Philadelphia Brothers.
An' I'm patriotic!"
504,APOLLO,504,"If yo' don't back up I'm gonna
send yo' home with a microphone
in yo' nose!"
505,REPORTER #2,505,"Why did you agree to fight a
man who has virtually no
chance of winning?"
506,APOLLO,506,"If history proves one thing,
everybody gotta chance --
Didn't yo' all ever hear of
David an' Goliath? -- 'Course
I woulda knocked out Goliath."
507,REPORTER #3,507,"It is a coincidence that
you're fighting a white man on
the most celebrated day in the
country's history?"
508,APOLLO,508,"The same coincidence that he's
fightin' a black man."
509,REPORTER #1,509,"What're your feelings about
the challenger?"
510,APOLLO,510,He's Italian.
511,REPORTER #1,511,What does that mean?
512,APOLLO,512,"It means if he can't fight, I
bet he can cook!"
513,PAULIE,513,"Do me a favor -- His lungs,
punch 'em out."
514,ADRIAN,514,Paul.
515,REPORTER #2,515,"This is your largest payday
ever -- How do you feel about
it?"
516,ROCKY,516,Feel?  I dunno... Happy.
517,REPORTER #2,517,How will you fight Apollo Creed?
518,ROCKY,518,"Creed's great, ain't he...
I'll do what I can."
519,REPORTER #1,519,"Where did you get the name,
'Italian Stallion?'"
520,ROCKY,520,"I thought of it 'bout eight
years ago, when I was eatin'
dinner."
521,REPORTER #2,521,"Is it true the most you've
ever made in a prizefight is
five hundred dollars?"
522,ROCKY,522,"Four hundred -- But that was a
long time ago."
523,REPORTER #2,523,"And now your payday will be
one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars.  Any comment?"
524,ROCKY,524,"Listen, I wanna say hi to my
girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!"
525,ADRIAN,525,"Oh, Rocky!"
526,PAULIE,526,Christ.
527,ADRIAN,527,You didn't!
528,ROCKY,528,Sure I did.  You heard.
529,COMMENTATOR,529,"A Bicentennial Fight --
January first.  It will be the
first sporting event on our
two hundredth birthday and is
already being called by many
the greatest farce in sports
history.  If this man lasts
more than a minute I would say
he's on borrowed time."
530,COMMENTATOR,530,"It's matches like this with
their exorbitant prices that
give sports a bad name -- Not
only is this match bad,
people, it's sad!  Why a Rocky
Balboa?  At the State Athletic
Commission, Larry Duggan
reporting."
531,PAULIE,531,The guy's a friggin' moron.
532,ROCKY,532,Why?
533,PAULIE,533,"Don't it matter none he's
makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd
break his lips."
534,ROCKY,534,It don't matter.
535,PAULIE,535,He's takin' cheap shots.
536,ROCKY,536,It don't bother me none.
537,PAULIE,537,"Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be
lookin' for people to help,
right?"
538,ROCKY,538,Help what?
539,PAULIE,539,"Y'know, to help keep ya livin'
clean."
540,ROCKY,540,I'll do okay.
541,PAULIE,541,"Ya gotta have a guy help ya
exercise, mebbe somebody to be
standin' by with a towel or
run errands, y'know."
542,ROCKY,542,"Hey, who cared about me
yesterday, huh?  Nobody -- I
think I'm gonna train myself."
543,PAULIE,543,"Without havin' good people
around, ya won't have such a
good chance."
544,ADRIAN,544,"Einstein flunked out of
school... twice."
545,PAULIE,545,That so.
546,ADRIAN,546,"Roosevelt finished last in his
class -- Beethoven was deaf,
an' Helen Keller was blind --
I think Rocky has a good chance."
547,ROCKY,547,See ya tomorrow.
548,ROCKY,548,"How'd ya like hearin' ya name
on TV?"
549,ADRIAN,549,"I don't know -- I was shocked.
Why did you do that?"
550,ROCKY,550,"Ya puttin' me on, right?"
551,ADRIAN,551,"Absolutely -- What time should
I expect you?"
552,ROCKY,552,'Bout seven.
553,ADRIAN,553,I'll be waiting.
554,ROCKY,554,"Y'know how I said that stuff
on television didn't bother me?"
555,ADRIAN,555,Yes.
556,ROCKY,556,It did.
557,ROCKY,557,"Y'know I won't be able to work
for ya no more."
558,GAZZO,558,"Hey -- if a good man can make
a better life, let him make it."
559,ROCKY,559,I feel bad about walkin'.
560,GAZZO,560,"Take your shot, kid -- You got
money for trainin' expenses?"
561,ROCKY,561,A few bucks.
562,GAZZO,562,"Here's five hundred -- Put it
in your glove."
563,ROCKY,563,Do I have to pay juice?
564,GAZZO,564,"Does Santa Claus charge juice?
Merry Christmas -- Now, how's
about my present, ya gonna win?"
565,ROCKY,565,Gonna try.
566,GAZZO,566,"Listen, kid, I'm with ya.  Ya
know, I'm with ya -- Italian,
we're blood.  You kill this
rug -- We Guinneas gotta show
these Afro-Americans where
it's at.  Give it your best
shot cause I want ya to prove
to these bums on the corner
that my man can't be beat by
this rug... Ya got any action
on the side."
567,ROCKY,567,No action.
568,GAZZO,568,"Ya gettin 150 grand killer.
Ya got any plans for it?
Whatta ya think?"
569,GAZZO (CONT'D),569,"Ya like to put it on the
street, make it work for ya?"
570,ROCKY,570,I'm gonna do somethin with it.
571,GAZZO,571,"Sure, you do what ya want.
Stay away from the stock market."
572,ROCKY,572,Black market?
573,GAZZO,573,"Same thing.  Ya know, Rock,
remember when we was kids, we
fought together.  An' I wasn't
well an' ya had to beat up
that Irish kid -- what's his
name? -- Gallager -- I bought
a suit and became a businessman.
You put on gloves.  An' I
remember Mama almost cried,
may she rest in peace -- an'
our ol' man who said ya had no
brains -- I'd like to lay
hands on that bastard.  You
ain't never had any luck.
Even when I owned you in '66
you never had luck.  But now I
think you might be gettin'
some luck kid.  Whatta you
think?"
574,ROCKY,574,"Yo, you gonna show, Tony?"
575,GAZZO,575,Where else am I gonna go.
576,GAZZO,576,Bet three grand on Rocky.
577,BODYGUARD,577,He's a bum -- are you kiddin?
578,GAZZO,578,No!  I'm not kiddin!
579,ROCKY,579,Look who's home!
580,MICKEY,580,"I seen the light.  I figure
somebody was home."
581,ROCKY,581,"Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin'
here?  Here, sit down."
582,ROCKY,582,"Best seat in the house -- Hey,
Mick, this is too much."
583,MICKEY,583,How do you mean?
584,ROCKY,584,"I'm usta seein' ya at the gym,
but seein' ya here, in my
house, it's kinda outta joint."
585,MICKEY,585,"Listen, Rock, you're a very
lucky guy."
586,ROCKY,586,Yeah.
587,MICKEY,587,What's happened is freak luck.
588,ROCKY,588,Freak luck for sure.
589,MICKEY,589,"Look at all them other fighters.
Real good boys.  Good records.
Colorful.  Fight their hearts
out for peanuts -- But who
cared?  Nobody.  They got it
shoved in their back door.
Nobody ever give them a shot
at the title..."
590,ROCKY,590,Freak luck is a strange thing.
591,MICKEY,591,Whatta' those?
592,ROCKY,592,Turtles -- domestic turtles.
593,MICKEY,593,"I'm here tellin' ya to be very
smart with this shot.  Like
the Bible sez, ya don't get no
second chance."
594,MICKEY,594,"Ya need a manager.  An advisor.
I been in the racket fifty
years.  I done it all, there
ain't nothin' about the world
of pugilism that ain't livin'
up here."
595,ROCKY,595,"Fifty years, huh."
596,MICKEY,596,"Fifty years.  The rep is known
around Philly, an' a good rep
can't be bought, but I don't
have to tell you that."
597,ROCKY,597,How 'bout a glass of water?
598,MICKEY,598,"Rocky, d'ya know what I done?"
599,ROCKY,599,... What?
600,MICKEY,600,"I done it all.  I've done an'
seen everything'.  Believe
what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya
shoulda seen the night in
Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny'
Russo outta the ring, September
14, 1923 -- same night Firpo
knocked Dempsey outta the ring.
But who got the Press?  He did.
He had a manager -- September
14, 1923."
601,ROCKY,601,Ya got a good mind for dates.
602,MICKEY,602,"Look at this face -- twenty-
one stitches over the left
eye, thirty-four over the
right -- my nose was busted
seventeen times, the last
being the Sailor Mike fight
New Year's Eve, 1940, in
Camden, New Jersey -- What a
professional pastin' I give
him.  Here, read about it."
603,MICKEY (CONT'D),603,"An' he give me the vegetable
on the ear.  I got pain an'
experience... an' you got
heart -- kinda remind me of
Marciano, ya do."
604,ROCKY,604,"Nobody ever said that --
There's his picture."
605,MICKEY,605,"Yeah, ya kinda remind me of
the Rock.  Ya move like 'im."
606,ROCKY,606,Really think so?
607,MICKEY,607,Ya got heart.
608,ROCKY,608,"Heart, but I ain't got no
Tocker."
609,MICKEY,609,"Christ, I know this business.
Rocky, when I was fightin' it
was the dirtiest racket goin',
see.  Pugs like me was treated
like fightin' dogs -- throw ya
in the pit an' for ten bucks
ya try to kill each other.  We
had no management..."
610,MICKEY (CONT'D),610,"fought in boxcars, in
whorehouse basements, any
joint with a floor -- October
1931 I fought a bum who put a
tack in the thumb of his glove
an' punched so many holes in
my face I had spit shootin'
outta my cheeks -- I never had
no manager watchin' out for
me -- See that picture outside
the gym -- 'Mighty Mick,'
that's me in my prime.  I had
all the tools.  I coulda
starched any lightweight husky
on the East Coast -- But I had
no management.  Nobody ever
got to know how slick I was,
but I had a head for business
an' stashed a few bucks an'
opened the gym -- It's a dirt
hole, I know it, but that an'
a lotta scars is what I got to
show for fifty years in the
business, kid -- now you come
along with this shot an' I
feel like it's me gettin' the
shot I never got... Yeah, we
was treated like dogs -- like
them Dago's, no offense, in
the Colosseum in Rome there --
An' now I got all this
knowledge, I wanna give it to
ya so I can protect ya an'
make sure ya get the best deal
ya can!"
611,MICKEY,611,"Respect, I always dished ya
respect."
612,ROCKY,612,... Ya gave Dipper my locker.
613,MICKEY,613,"I'm sorry, I -- I made a
mistake.  Kid, I'm askin' man
to man.  I wanna be ya manager."
614,ROCKY,614,"The fight's set -- I don't
need a manager."
615,MICKEY,615,"Look, you can't buy what I
know.  Ya can't.  I've seen it
all!  I got pain an' I got
experience."
616,ROCKY,616,I got pain an' experience too.
617,MICKEY,617,"Please, kid."
618,ROCKY,618,"Whatever I got, I always got
on the slide.  This shot's no
different.  I didn't earn
nothin' -- I got it on the
slide... I needed ya help
about ten years ago when I was
startin', but ya never helped
me none."
619,MICKEY,619,"If ya was wantin' my help, why
didn't ya ask?  Just ask."
620,ROCKY,620,"I asked, but ya never helped
nothin'! -- Like the Bible
sez, ya don't get no second
chance."
621,MICKEY,621,"Rocky, I'm seventy-six years
old.  Maybe you can be the
winner I never was -- your
shot is my last shot!"
622,PAULIE,622,How ya feelin'?
623,ROCKY,623,... Tight.
624,PAULIE,624,I got whiskey here.
625,ROCKY,625,... No.
626,PAULIE,626,"This is the guy who's fightin'
Apollo Creed."
627,JOSE,627,"Good luck -- Kill him, man."
628,PAULIE,628,"Hip -- Hip -- Hooray!  C'mon --
Hip -- Hip --"
629,JOSE,629,"Hooray, man."
630,PAULIE,630,"Rock'll be comin' by every
mornin' to pick up some
Prime -- can't train on that
store crap."
631,PAULIE,631,"If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end
up hangin' on the hook, right?"
632,ROCKY,632,Gazzo's a good man.
633,PAULIE,633,"How 'bout you talk to 'em
about me?"
634,PAULIE,634,Please do me that favor.
635,ROCKY,635,"Keep this job, ya eat better."
636,PAULIE,636,"Y'know, d'ya think you an' my
sister -- Ah, doin' good
together?"
637,ROCKY,637,Whatta you think?
638,PAULIE,638,"Ain't sure, what's the story?"
639,ROCKY,639,What?
640,PAULIE,640,The story -- what's happenin'?
641,PAULIE,641,Ya really like her?
642,ROCKY,642,Sure I like her.
643,PAULIE,643,"What's the attraction?  I
don't see it?"
644,ROCKY,644,I dunno -- she fills gaps.
645,PAULIE,645,What gaps?
646,ROCKY,646,"She got gaps.  I got gaps --
together we fill the gaps."
647,PAULIE,647,You ballin' her?
648,ROCKY,648,"Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
sister."
649,PAULIE,649,"C'mon, ya screwin' her?"
650,ROCKY,650,"That's why I can't put ya
together with Gazzo, cause ya
talk too much -- big mouth."
651,PAULIE,651,"Hit the rump.  The rump!
Ya'll break the ribs!"
652,PAULIE,652,"We do that to Creed an'
they'll take us to jail for
murder."
653,ROCKY,653,"Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
sister."
654,MICKEY,654,"Stop!  Stop!  I can't stand it!
It's clumsy.  You're off
balance."
655,MICKEY,655,"Tie it to both ankles -- Leave
two feet slack."
656,ROCKY,656,I never had good footwork.
657,MICKEY,657,"Forget the footwork -- You're
off balance.  The legs are
sticking everywhere.  Marciano
had the same problem, an' the
string cured it.  When you can
hit and move without breakin'
the string you'll have balance."
658,MIKE,658,"You'll be a very dangerous
person."
659,BOY,659,"Rocky, could we have your
autograph?"
660,ROCKY,660,... Sure.
661,MICKEY,661,"Don't you boys ever interrupt
when I'm conductin' business,
or I'll kill you both -- Go
away."
662,MICKEY,662,"Autographs!  Ya wanna be a
writer or a fighter?  Let's
work."
663,MIKE,663,... we got visitors.
664,MICKEY,664,Can I help you guys?
665,REPORTER,665,Set the camera up over there.
666,REPORTER,666,"We're from Channel Seven --
Covering the pre-fight training."
667,MICKEY,667,I own the place.
668,CAMERAMAN,668,Rolling here.
669,SOUND MAN,669,Speed here.
670,REPORTER,670,"We're here at Goldmill's
Gym -- A Philadelphia landmark
of sorts since 1929 -- The
stench of toil permeates every
corner.  The sweat a trademark
of a unique profession... Yet,
the most unique fixture is an
unprecedented 50 to 1 underdog
heavyweight named, Rocky Balboa."
671,ROCKY,671,Should I do this?
672,REPORTER,672,"So much has happened lately --
Has it changed your life style
much?"
673,ROCKY,673,... People talk to me more.
674,REPORTER,674,"How're you preparing for this
Bicentennial bout?"
675,FIGHTER,675,"Readin' fuckin' history books,
man!"
676,REPORTER,676,"We can cut that out later.
Apollo Creed says he'll let
you stay three rounds before
he puts you away."
677,ROCKY,677,Apollo's a great fighter.
678,REPORTER,678,Do you feel you have a chance?
679,ROCKY,679,Maybe --
680,ROCKY,680,I'll tear his head off.
681,REPORTER,681,"Do you have anything derogatory
to say about the Champion?"
682,ROCKY,682,"Derogatory?  Yeah, he's great."
683,APOLLO,683,"I am the Champion of the whole
world!!!"
684,APOLLO,684,"Italian Stallion, I come over
to tell you to be very smart
an' after this fight donate
what's gonna be left of your
body to science, cause after
this fight what's left won't
fill a tuna fish can!... So
beware, Mon Cher!!!"
685,APOLLO,685,"This classic fight -- Tha's
right, this bicentennial
fight's goin' down in the
history books 'cause January
first I'm gonna be the first
man to bounce another man offa
the planet Pluto!"
686,APOLLO,686,"Now I gots a special
announcement, y'hear.  For the
first time in alotta years
this championship fight is
gonna be on your home T.V.!
Free -- 'Course that's just
for Philly -- My present to
the city..."
687,APOLLO (CONT'D),687,"Now some ya'll ain't much on
likin' me, but ya gotta admit
Apollo Creed is one DAMN
generous, 100% pure, government
inspected, Afro-American Folk
Hero!!!"
688,DIPPER,688,"Ya nothin', Boy!"
689,DIPPER,689,I say ya nothin'!
690,MICKEY,690,What's happenin' here?
691,DIPPER,691,"I'm happenin'!  This pig is
takin' my shot -- I iz a
contender.  He's nothin'."
692,ROCKY,692,"Yo', Dipper, why're ya --"
693,DIPPER,693,"Spar me in front of these here
TV dudes -- I knock ya ass to
Jersey!"
694,MICKEY,694,"You can forget about sparring,
kid."
695,DIPPER,695,"Yo' know I iz the best man
here!  Yo' said so yoself!"
696,MICKEY,696,"Why let Rocky here take a
chance on cuttin' or breakin'
a hand? -- Take a shower,
Dipper."
697,DIPPER,697,"Don't mouth me, old man, I'll
knock yo' out too.  C'mon,
wop, spar me, let everybody
see who's got the heat around
here."
698,DIPPER,698,"Man, yo' best keep them
cameras out!  Fight me, boy!
Let Creed here see the kind of
punk he's fightin'!"
699,MIKE,699,"Don't chance it, man -- He's
sick."
700,MICKEY,700,"This is gettin' outta hand --
Rocky will fight in the ring
January first, not here!"
701,DIPPER,701,"Yo' yellow, old man."
702,MICKEY,702,"Not yellow, cautious."
703,MICKEY,703,"See, it's very easy for a
fighter to accidentally hurt --"
704,DIPPER,704,"If yo're afraid to fight me,
then get down an' kiss my
feet, boy."
705,MICKEY,705,"Let's take a walk, Rock.
Please, don't take a chance.
He wants to hurt you so you
can't fight."
706,MIKE,706,"Why you tryin' to cut 'im, man!
Back off, scumbag, or I'll
bite your face!"
707,DIPPER,707,"... Now, boy, kiss my feet."
708,DIPPER,708,... Kiss 'em.
709,MICKEY,709,"The kid's got cannons -- Print
that."
710,ADRIAN,710,Don't you open them anymore?
711,ROCKY,711,"They either say, 'Kill the
nigger' or 'Hope you die,
Honky.' -- What ya got in the
bag?"
712,ADRIAN,712,Like?
713,ROCKY,713,Sharp -- Real nice.
714,ADRIAN,714,"Really -- You don't think
they're overly feminine?"
715,ROCKY,715,No... Sharp -- You look great.
716,ROCKY,716,"Adrian, you really look great,
y'know -- But I can't fool
around durin' trainin' --
makes the legs weak."
717,ADRIAN,717,Don't want weak legs.
718,ROCKY,718,"Can't fool around -- You look
very great."
719,ADRIAN,719,-- The legs.
720,ROCKY,720,"Yeah... But I think weak legs
ain't bad sometimes, y'know."
721,ADRIAN,721,I thought it might be cute.
722,ROCKY,722,Ya right --
723,ROCKY,723,"Mebbe we best just hold
hands -- the shirt made me
feel guilty, y'know."
724,PAULIE,724,"Yo, Rock.  I made a few phone
calls an' thanks to me ya
goin' to be a big man --
Thatta dog?"
725,ROCKY,725,Whatta these guys want?
726,PAULIE,726,To see ya train.
727,ROCKY,727,"Yo, what's with you? -- It was
suppose to be private."
728,PAULIE,728,"I thought I was doin' ya a
favor -- C'mon inside --
Y'know, my sister really likes
ya."
729,COMMENTATOR,729,"Just relax, Mr. Balboa --"
730,COMMENTATOR,730,"Today we're here with
heavyweight challenger, Rocky
Balboa.  The reason we are
standing in a refrigerated box
is that Mr. Balboa has an
unusual method of training and
in a moment he is going to
demonstrate it for our viewing
audience -- But first, Rocky,
how did you ever come to train
in an icebox?"
731,ROCKY,731,"Ah -- My buddy Paulie let me
in one day an' I hit the beef
here an' liked it -- An' since
I become a challenger, the
owner don't mind neither."
732,COMMENTATOR,732,"Is this a common training
method -- I mean do other
fighters pound raw meat?"
733,ROCKY,733,"I think me and Paulie invented
it."
734,COMMENTATOR,734,"Would you give us a
demonstration?"
735,COMMENTATOR,735,"... Diane Lewis in the
meathouse with the Southpaw,
Rocky Balboa."
736,APOLLO,736,"How much is being channeled
into West Coast closed-circuit
advertising?"
737,LAWYER,737,Three hundred thousand.
738,APOLLO,738,Make it four hundred an' fifty.
739,APOLLO,739,"Send two hundred roses to the
mayor's wife from me, get a
picture an' make sure it gets
all the papers."
740,BUSINESSMAN #3,740,"Do ya want to run the fifteen
radio spots in the mid-west?
I think you could spend the
money better in Canadian
publicity."
741,APOLLO,741,"Yeah, I'd like to get Canada --
see, if we can get a tax
break -- Gimme the figures on
the Program Concession."
742,TRAINER,742,"Apollo, you oughta come see
this boy you're gonna fight on
TV -- looks like he means
business."
743,APOLLO,743,"I mean business, too --"
744,APOLLO,744,"The gross rental of the arena
is gonna include the four
hundred ushers, right? --
Gimme some coffee."
745,ADRIAN,745,"... And he called the
reporters --"
746,ROCKY,746,Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
747,ADRIAN,747,"Don't be mad at him -- He just
wants to help."
748,ROCKY,748,"Yo -- I ain't mad.  I'm just
outta joint when reporters are
around -- They take cheap
shots an' Paulie knows it."
749,ADRIAN,749,"... Are you going to say
anything to him?"
750,ROCKY,750,"... What's to say?  I dunno
what he wants from me --"
751,PAULIE,751,"Nothin'!  I want nothin' from
you!!!"
752,ADRIAN,752,Paulie!
753,PAULIE,753,"Shutup!  I want nothin' -- I
ain't no charity case!  Get
outta my house!"
754,ADRIAN,754,It's not your house --
755,PAULIE,755,"You ain't no friend no more --
Go home!  Outta my house I
want ya!"
756,ADRIAN,756,Don't talk like that to him!
757,PAULIE,757,Get outta my life both of ya's.
758,PAULIE,758,Outta my house I want ya!!
759,ROCKY,759,"... It's cold outside, Paulie."
760,PAULIE,760,"I don't want ya messin' up my
sister no more -- He's scum
from the corner, I don't raise
ya to hang with no bum!"
761,PAULIE,761,"... Wanna hit on me?  C'mon --
C'mon, I'll break both ya arms
so's they never work..."
762,ADRIAN,762,... Paulie.  Stop now!
763,PAULIE,763,I want 'im outta here --
764,PAULIE,764,"Don't think I'm good enough to
work for Gazzo?"
765,PAULIE,765,"That's what I think of bums
like you an' Gazzo!"
766,PAULIE,766,"You're goin' up an' don't care
enough to throw Paulie some
crumbs!"
767,PAULIE,767,"I give ya meat, an' I give ya
my sister, too!"
768,ADRIAN,768,Only a pig would say that!
769,PAULIE,769,"You forget what I went through
to give ya the best."
770,ADRIAN,770,"You gave me what?!  Knots!
You gave me knots in here
every day -- you made me
scared of everything!"
771,PAULIE,771,"I always seen ya had the best,
but did ya ever think of
puttin' in a good word for me
with this scumbag!"
772,ADRIAN,772,Don't do that again!
773,PAULIE,773,"Get away from me -- I could
never even get married 'cause
you couldn't live by yaself --
ya'd die by yaself!  So
instead I put you two
together -- Did ya think of
puttin' in a good word for
me? -- You owe me!"
774,ADRIAN,774,Owe you what?
775,PAULIE,775,"You owe me an' are supposed to
treat me good!"
776,ADRIAN,776,"Good?  Good, Paulie?!  I've
been treatin' you like a baby.
Since I can't remember it's so
long -- I'm the only one who
feeds you an' puts you in bed
when ya can't stand up -- and
it's you that made me feel
like a loser -- That's what ya
use to call me 'Loser' -- What
kind of name is that?  So can
ya blame me for not remembering
to talk about you when I'm
with Rocky -- I don't owe you,
Paulie, you owe me."
777,PAULIE,777,You busted?!
778,ADRIAN,778,What?!
779,PAULIE,779,"You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in
ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya
pulled down ya pants an' let
him have it, didn't ya!!"
780,ROCKY,780,Hey --
781,PAULIE,781,... I can't haul meat no more.
782,ROCKY,782,What can I do about it?
783,PAULIE,783,"Christ, I been beggin' ya for
a break until I'm sick inside."
784,ROCKY,784,"What break?  Huh?  What break!
Who am I to give breaks!  I'm
a fighter, you haul meat.  You
do what you do an' I do what I
do best -- that's it -- that's
life, man!"
785,ROCKY,785,"... An' what ya said to my
girlfriend ain't right -- Do
it again, I'll kill ya."
786,ROCKY,786,Wanna hear a dirty joke?
787,ADRIAN,787,... Yes --
788,MICKEY,788,"His defense is great, can't
lie 'bout that -- You have a
rollin' style.  Can't retreat
as fast -- But your style
ain't retreatin'."
789,MICKEY,789,"See how he plays sometimes --
Drives his cornermen nuts.
Nobody knows his next move --
Him included."
790,MICKEY,790,"Killer instinct -- Ya both got
the killer touch.  Interestin'.
See that! -- Right-cross
combination.  Beautiful.  But
you got the power to rip the
body."
791,MICKEY,791,"Rocky, when ya climb into the
square, an' know ya' meetin'
the best fighter in the world,
ya' gonna be ready, ya' gonna
be ready 'cause I been waitin'
for fifty years -- Fifty years.
When I'm done with you, you'll
gonna be able to spit nails."
792,MICKEY (CONT'D),792,"You'll gonna be able to eat
lightin' and crap thunder --
You'll be a very, very
dangerous person..."
793,MICKEY,793,"What cha say, Benny -- Meet
'The Rock.' This is our
cutman, Benny Stein."
794,ROCKY,794,"Yo, Benny."
795,MICKEY,795,"Check the eyes, Ben."
796,BENNY,796,"Ain't bad.  Seen worse --
Cover up an' things should be
okay."
797,MICKEY,797,Take a shower.
798,PAULIE,798,"Yo, Rock, I think I found an
angle to make some bread usin'
ya name, ya mind?"
799,MAYOR,799,"Sit down, Rocky."
800,MAYOR,800,"I've been going over your
record -- You've been the busy
type --"
801,MAYOR,801,"Nineteen arrests -- probation
three times -- expelled from
seven public schools in 1964
and '65."
802,MAYOR,802,"I'm a very busy man, but I
just wanted to remind you that
you'll be setting an example
for thousands of guys like
yourself and maybe start them
off in a new direction and
give our police force a
break -- I also hope you try
your very best and bring pride
to Philadelphia."
803,ROCKY,803,... I'll try.
804,MAYOR,804,"Would you stand up, please."
805,MAYOR,805,"Thank you for coming by,
Rocky -- good luck."
806,ROCKY,806,Any time.
807,MAYOR,807,"Wait... After the fight you'll
have nearly a hundred and
fifty thousand dollars -- What
do you plan to do with it?"
808,ROCKY,808,... Run for mayor.
809,ADRIAN,809,"Rocky, do you realize everybody
in this country knows your
face, and after the fight
everybody in the world is
going to."
810,ROCKY,810,Yeah...
811,ROCKY,811,"My first call... Hello?  Yeah,
speakin' -- Who is this?
Bruce?  Bruce who? -- Yo,
Bruce!  How ya been?  I ain't
seen ya for nine or eight
years -- Yeah, things is
great, how's things with you
upstate -- Ya sellin' real
estate, hey, that's a good
job... Yeah, I gotta advance,
but I bought ringside seats
for the guys at the gym.  I
get the hundred an' fifty
grand after the fight..."
812,ROCKY,812,"... Yeah, I know it's a lotta
money -- Condominiums?  Nobody
uses them anybody.  Listen, I
think a pet shop is a good
investment, y'know -- I don't
care 'bout long hours --
there's no depreciation --
that don't matter none to
me -- Yeah, I like animals.
Why don't ya give me ya number
an' I'll call ya back?  Lemme
getta pencil --"
813,ROCKY,813,"Okay, what is it -- four-
twelve 659-2424.  Yeah, yeah,
thanks for callin' -- Sure
I'll get back to ya, Bruce --
see ya."
814,ADRIAN,814,"What was that you said about a
pet shop?"
815,ROCKY,815,... What?
816,ADRIAN,816,"What did you say about a pet
shop?"
817,ROCKY,817,"I don't want ya cleanin'
nobody else's cages no more."
818,ADRIAN,818,Is everything all right?
819,ROCKY,819,I gotta go out for a while.
820,ROCKY,820,... Come.
821,MICKEY,821,"... I know what you're
thinkin'm kid -- At least ya
gotta shot -- All ya can do is
try ya' best."
822,ROCKY,822,... Can't do it.
823,ADRIAN,823,... What?
824,ROCKY,824,... I can't beat him.
825,ADRIAN,825,Apollo?
826,ROCKY,826,"Yeah, I can't beat him."
827,ROCKY,827,"I been watchin' the movies --
studyin' -- He ain't weak
nowhere."
828,ADRIAN,828,What're we going to do?
829,ROCKY,829,... I dunno.
830,ADRIAN,830,"Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard."
831,ROCKY,831,"It ain't so bad, 'cause I was
a nothin' before --"
832,ADRIAN,832,Don't say that.
833,ROCKY,833,"C'mon, it's true -- But that
don't bother me -- I just
wanna prove somethin' -- I
ain't no bum... It don't
matter if I lose... Don't
matter if he opens my head...
The only thing I wanna do is
go the distance -- That's all.
Nobody's ever gone fifteen
rounds with Creed.  If I go
them fifteen rounds, an' that
bell rings an' I'm still
standin', I'm gonna know then
I weren't just another bum
from the neighborhood..."
834,ROCKY,834,... No foolin' around.
835,MICKEY,835,"... It's time, kid."
836,ADRIAN,836,... I'll wait for you here.
837,ROCKY,837,"Yo, Mick, can I have my rob?"
838,ROCKY,838,"""THE ITALIAN STALLION"""
839,MICKEY,839,"Don't you care what the people
will say?"
840,ROCKY,840,... I'm doin' it for a friend.
841,MICKEY,841,Whatta you get outta this?
842,ROCKY,842,"I get the robe an' Paulie gets
three grand."
843,MICKEY,843,... Shrewd.
844,COMMENTATOR #1,844,"We would like to welcome our
viewing audience to the Grand
World Championship Bicentennial
Heavyweight Fight -- the first
major event of the Bicentennial
Year... A point of interest is
that the fight is being beamed
to more than seven hundred and
fifty million fans in theatres
in nearly every corner of the
world.  I would like to
welcome an old friend, and co-
commentator for this evening's
event -- Jimmy Michaels."
845,COMMENTATOR #2,845,"Thank you, Bob.  The
electricity is everywhere
tonight.  Rocky Balboa, a
fifty-to-one underdog, is
living a Cinderella story
which has captured peoples'
imaginations all over the
world -- to quote a popular
sports magazine, 'The fighting
style should be 'The Caveman
Against the Cavalier.' From
the increase in sound it
appears the challenger is now
approaching the ring... His
record is forty-four wins,
twenty losses and thirty-eight
knockouts."
846,COMMENTATOR #1,846,"I only wonder if this man has
the skill to go past three
rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'"
847,COMMENTATOR #2,847,"You could go deaf with the
noise -- it undoubtedly means
Champion Apollo Creed is
heading towards the ring --"
848,COMMENTATOR #1,848,"Am I seeing right?  Creed is
approaching the ring in a boat.
Is he supposed to be George
Washington?  Obviously so."
849,COMMENTATOR #2,849,"It's been confirmed that it is
definitely an impersonation of
George Washington -- a great
way to start 1976 off."
850,COMMENTATOR #1,850,I agree.
851,APOLLO,851,I want you!  I want you!
852,MICKEY,852,Don't let 'im get you tight.
853,ROCKY,853,"Whatta ya think that outfit
cost?"
854,ANNOUNCER,854,"Ladies and gentlemen --
Welcome to the Bicentennial
Heavyweight Championship
Fight... We are very proud to
have with us four former Great
Champions... Ladies an' gents,
'The one and only 'Manassa
Mauler' -- Jack Dempsey!'"
855,DEMPSEY,855,"Good luck, kid."
856,ROCKY,856,"Christ, Jack Dempsey."
857,ANNOUNCER,857,"Former Middleweight Champion --
'The Bronx Bull' -- Jake
LaMotta!"
858,ANNOUNCER,858,"The man with the big punch --
Everybody's favorite, 'The
Brown Bomber ' -- Joe Louis!"
859,ROCKY,859,They must be friends.
860,ANNOUNCER,860,"Now, last but certainly not
least -- the former Heavyweight
Champion, a son of Philly,
Smoking Joe Frazier!"
861,FRAZIER,861,Save some of him for me.
862,COMMENTATOR #1,862,"The former champ looks great --
Can we get Joe over here --
here he comes."
863,COMMENTATOR #1,863,"Joe, what are your feelings
about tonight's fight?"
864,FRAZIER,864,"Well, I think any man who
works an' trains hard always
gotta chance."
865,COMMENTATOR #2,865,"You look in great shape, Joe."
866,FRAZIER,866,I'm always in shape.
867,ANNOUNCER,867,"... Now for the evening's main
event -- In the corner to my
right, The Challenger, wearing
white trunks -- At one hundred
an' ninety-one pounds, one of
Philly's own sons -- 'The
Italian Stallion,' Rocky Balboa!"
868,ANNOUNCER,868,"In the far corner, wearing
red, white an' blue -- Weighing
in at two hundred and ten
pounds -- Undefeated in forty-
six fights -- the Heavyweight
Champion of the World -- 'The
Master of Disaster' -- Apollo
Creed!"
869,REFEREE,869,... Now come out fighting.
870,MICKEY,870,"God bless ya, Rock."
871,ROCKY,871,"Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try."
872,COMMENTATOR #1,872,"The Champ stings the slower
challenger with jabs at
will -- Balboa blocks eighty
percent of the blows with his
face -- Creed doesn't look the
best he's ever been but is
moving smoothly -- Creed snaps
out a triple combination that
backs Balboa into a corner --
oh, a solid hook by Creed, a
master of fist-men."
873,COMMENTATOR #2,873,"The Champion is smiling and
toying with the man -- trying
to give the fans their money's
worth and make a show of it
with the badly out-classes
challenger -- Another left to
right combination.  I feel
sorry for --"
874,COMMENTATOR #1,874,Creed is down!!!
875,MICKEY,875,"You can do it!  Goddamnit, you
got the power!  The body, get
the body!!!  Ya got him goin'!"
876,REFEREE,876,Six!... Seven!... Eight!...
877,APOLLO,877,"... Come at me, sucker!"
878,ROCKY,878,How am I doin'?
879,MICKEY,879,Real good.
880,ROCKY,880,See how fast he is -- damn!
881,MICKEY,881,"Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin
down!!  Use the legs and drive
through 'im.  Attack --
Attack -- Attack!"
882,APOLLO,882,"... That boy damn near broke
my arm."
883,TRAINER,883,"Sure -- He can hit -- Don't
play no more -- Stick an'
move, hear?"
884,APOLLO,884,I'll carry him 'till the third.
885,TRAINER,885,"Don't play with this man, he's
fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel
some real heat!"
886,APOLLO,886,"Man, I rearranged his face
with that right -- The people
love what's happenin' tonight."
887,TRAINER,887,"People nothin', you in a
fight, my man, -- ya best
believe what you hear... Knock
that boy out soon an' let's go
home."
888,MICKEY,888,Ya nose is broke.
889,ROCKY,889,Damn!  How's it look?
890,MICKEY,890,"Can't hardly tell.  Don't
swallow the blood -- Go for
his ribs.  Don't let 'im
breathe."
891,ROCKY,891,... The guy's great.
892,MICKEY,892,"Why don't ya tell 'im you're a
fan!"
893,COMMENTATOR #2,893,"If you had asked anyone who
knows boxing, they never
would've predicted a first
round knockdown and the second
round punishment to the body
of the Champion... Most
fighters will tell you,
receiving a good body punch is
the next worst thing to dying."
894,COMMENTATOR #1,894,"Round three ready to start and
should be interesting to see
if Creed can put the challenger
away -- there goes the bell."
895,COMMENTATOR #1,895,"Apollo almost sprints out of
his corner -- feints and
throws a pair of left-right
combinations.  Balboa drops
beneath a left upper cut and
lands a very solid shot on
Creed's temple -- not much
movement from Balboa, duck a
left, a right, another left
and explodes with a right hook
to the temple -- I mean
explodes.  The Champ backs off."
896,COMMENTATOR #2,896,"There's no way Apollo expected
this kind of hitting power."
897,COMMENTATOR #1,897,"No way -- but the brilliant
ability of the Champion to
master situations like this is
one of his most outstanding
traits -- Creed tosses a
perfect right hand that rocks
Rocky."
898,COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D),898,"Creed on the offensive --
Balboa takes the punishment
and counters with a left flush
over the heart... that hurt."
899,TRAINER,899,Cover your face!  Cover up!
900,TRAINER,900,"My man's cut, my man's
bleedin' -- Get ready!"
901,TRAINER,901,"Bad?  Talk to me, man!"
902,DOCTOR,902,"Deep, but passable."
903,APOLLO,903,"... That man's takin' his job
too serious."
904,TRAINER,904,"He's movin' to your left --
don't let him no more -- dance
and stick, hear?  Don't
play -- I know what ya feelin',
but don't play."
905,APOLLO,905,He got lucky.
906,TRAINER,906,"Luck!  You fightin' a crazy
man -- but you got him hurt
bad."
907,TRAINER,907,"More ice, now!"
908,MICKEY,908,"How you holdin' up, kid?"
909,ROCKY,909,Fine... That guy's great.
910,MICKEY,910,"Gimme the water!  Ya getttin'
tagged with his right.  I
think you should feint left
and high hook 'im -- Benny,
check the eyes!  Can ya see?"
911,ROCKY,911,See what?
912,MIKE,912,"Ya sappin' his strength --
He's losin' steam."
913,ROCKY,913,He ain't losin' nothin'.
914,MICKEY,914,"Keep on him -- You're doin'
great."
915,ANDY,915,... The Rock's got real stones.
916,APOLLO,916,C'mon -- Lemme cut yo'!
917,COMMENTATOR #1,917,"Without a doubt this is the
most punishing brawl I have
ever seen -- The ringside
audience is spotted with blood."
918,COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D),918,"This fight should have been
stopped rounds ago but Rocky
Balboa refuses to fall --"
919,COMMENTATOR #2,919,"Not only has he refused to
fall, but he has beaten the
Champion's body without mercy
and the bout has become a
vicious slugfest."
920,APOLLO,920,My side.
921,TRAINER,921,Get that doctor.
922,APOLLO,922,No doctor!
923,TRAINER,923,"You're hurtin', man!"
924,APOLLO,924,"No doctor!... I'm feelin'
good, bro!"
925,MICKEY,925,Wanna keep goin'?
926,ROCKY,926,Would you keep goin'?
927,MICKEY,927,... Yeah.
928,MIKE,928,"No more, ya wanna lose an eye?
No more."
929,ROCKY,929,"Open my eyes -- Please, open
my eyes!"
930,REFEREE,930,Six -- Seven -- Eight --
931,APOLLO,931,... Ribs broke --
932,TRAINER,932,"Yo' bleedin' inside, man --
Get that doctor."
933,APOLLO,933,One more round.
934,TRAINER,934,"Don't kill yourself, man --
Let the doctor stop the fight."
935,APOLLO,935,... Stop jivin'!
936,TRAINER,936,"Cover the ribs -- Look here,
elbow down, tight -- Tight --
stand straight -- you're the
best, you're the best!"
937,APOLLO,937,... Thanks.
938,ROCKY,938,"How I look out there, Mick?"
939,MICKEY,939,"Great, kid, great."
940,DOCTOR,940,"One more round -- How do you
feel?"
941,ROCKY,941,"Fine -- Go away, I'm gonna
make it -- I'm gonna make it!"
942,MICKEY,942,"We gotta stop it, kid."
943,MIKE,943,Ya gave it ya best shot!
944,MICKEY,944,"Nobody's gonna say ya didn't
give ya all.  I can't let ya
go out."
945,ROCKY,945,"I'll kill ya all... Don't stop
nothin' --"
946,COMMENTATOR #1,946,"The fight has slowed down to a
near stand-still -- Creed
circles to Rocky's right...
The spectrum is nearly
silent -- Neither fighter has
made a motion to throw... I've
never seen anything like it in
the last round of a
championship fight... Apollo
spits blood on the canvas.  It
appears he is protecting his
right side.  His ribs were
probably injured at the end of
round fourteen."
947,COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D),947,"It's confirmed, unofficially,
Creed's ribs may be broken --
Apollo fakes a left and throws
a big tired right -- Balboa's
mouthpiece is out!  Creed
attacks with one hand!"
948,ROCKY,948,Gimme ya best!!!!
949,ROCKY,949,Gimme ya best!!!
950,APOLLO,950,... Ain't gonna be no rematch.
951,ROCKY,951,... Don't want one.
952,ANNOUNCER,952,"Attention, please!!  Attention!!
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight
we have had the rare privilege
to have witnessed the greatest
exhibitions of stamina and
guts ever in the history of
sports."
953,ANNOUNCER,953,"Ladies and gentlemen -- We
have a split decision!"
954,ANNOUNCER,954,"Judge Walker scores it eight-
seven Creed... Judge Roseman
scores it eight-seven Balboa."
955,ANNOUNCER,955,"Judge Conners scores it nine-
six Creed... Winner and still
Heavyweight Champion of the
World, Apollo Creed!"
956,MICKEY,956,"I don't care what they say,
you're a winner."
957,ROCKY,957,"Yo, can I have my locker back?"
958,ADRIAN,958,"I love you -- I love you -- I
love you..."
