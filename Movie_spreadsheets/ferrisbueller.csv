0,FATHER'S VOICE (TOM),0,Where's my wallet?!
1,SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY (TODD),1,YOU IDIOT!!
2,TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL (KIMBERLY),2,MOM!
3,TODD,3,SHUT-UP!
4,EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL (JEANIE),4,I NEED A TOWEL!!
5,TOM,5,JOYCE!
6,KIMBERLY,6,"When you turn ten, your head's going
to swell up real big like a watermelon
and we're going to have to put you
to sleep like they do with a dog."
7,TODD,7,MOM!
8,TOM,8,JOYCE!!
9,JEANIE,9,WHO PISSED ON THE TOILET SEAT!? MOTHER!!
10,TOM,10,Where's Mom?
11,TODD,11,Is my head going to swell up?
12,TOM,12,What?!
13,JEANIE,13,"OH, MY GOD! THE TOILET PAPER'S ALL WET!!!"
14,MOTHER (JOYCE),14,TOM!
15,TODD,15,What's that?
16,KIMBERLY,16,Wait! Hold still!
17,TODD,17,What?!
18,KIMBERLY,18,You heads starting to swell up!!
19,TOM,19,What's the matter?
20,JOYCE,20,It's Ferris!
21,TOM,21,What's wrong?
22,JOYCE,22,"What's wrong? For Christ's sake!
Look at him!"
23,TOM,23,Ferris?
24,JOYCE,24,"He doesn't have a fever. But he says
his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots."
25,TOM,25,"What's the matter, Ferris?"
26,JOYCE,26,Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy.
27,TOM,27,Should you call the doctor?
28,JOYCE,28,He doesn't want me to.
29,TOM,29,"Why don't you want Mom to call
the doctor?"
30,TOM,30,What?
31,FERRIS,31,Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.
32,FERRIS,32,"I have a test today. I have to take it.
I want to get into a good college
so I can have a fruitful life..."
33,JOYCE,33,"You're not going to school like
this."
34,JOYCE,34,"Maybe I should call the office and
tell them I won't be in."
35,FERRIS,35,"I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!"
36,JEAN,36,"Oh, fine. What's this? What's his problem?"
37,JOYCE,37,He doesn't feel well.
38,JEAN,38,"Yeah, right. Dry that one out
and you can fertilize the lawn."
39,TOM,39,"That's enough, Jeanie."
40,JEANIE,40,"You're not falling for this, are you?
Tell me you're not falling for this."
41,FERRIS,41,"Is that Jeanie? I can't see that
far. Jeanie?"
42,JEANIE,42,"Pucker up and squat, Ferris."
43,JOYCE,43,"Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school."
44,JEANIE,44,"You're really letting him stay home?
I can't believe this. If I was bleeding
out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to
school. It's so unfair."
45,FERRIS,45,"Please don't be upset with me, Jeanie.
Be thankful that you're fit and have
your health. Cherish it."
46,JEANIE,46,"Oh, I wanna puke."
47,KIMBERLY,47,Myocardial infarction?
48,JOYCE,48,"Get your stuff. Daddy'll be right
down."
49,KIMBERLY,49,"Syphilitic meningitus? That would be
a huge family embarrassment."
50,TOM,50,Get downstairs!
51,KIMBERLY,51,"If he dies, I got dibs on his stereo."
52,TODD,52,Dad? Does my head look alright?
53,JOYCE,53,Get downstairs! Now!
54,TODD,54,"Just answer me one question! Is it
swelling up? Kim said it was going
to get as big as..."
55,KIMBERLY (OC),55,A WATERMELON!
56,TODD,56,Shut-up!
57,JOYCE,57,Get downstairs! NOW!
58,FERRIS,58,"I'll be okay. I'll just sleep.
Maybe I'll have an aspirin around
noon."
59,JOYCE,59,"I'm showing houses to the family
from California today but I'll be in
the area. My office'll know where
I am, if you need me."
60,TOM,60,"I'll check it with you, too."
61,FERRIS,61,"It's nice to know I have such
loving, caring parents. You're
both very special people."
62,JOYCE,62,"I hope you feel better, pumpkin."
63,TOM,63,Get some rest.
64,JOYCE (OC),64,"We love you, sweetie."
65,TOM (OC),65,Call if you need us.
66,FERRIS,66,They bought it.
67,FERRIS,67,"Incredible! One of the worst performances
of my career and they never doubted it
for a second."
68,FERRIS,68,What a beautiful day!
69,FERRIS,69,"Parents always fall for the clammy hands.
It's physical evidence of illness. It's
a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are
generally pretty hip to the fever scams.
And to make them work you have to go a hundred
and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous
mother and you end up in a doctor's office
and that's worse than school."
70,FERRIS,70,"Fake a stomach cramp and when you're
doubled over, moaning and wailing, just
lick your palms. It's a little stupid
and childish but then so if high school.
Right?"
71,FERRIS,71,"This is my ninth sick day with semester.
If I go for ten, I'm probably going to
have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely
must make this one count."
72,FERRIS,72,"I don't care if you're fifty five
or seven, everybody needs a day off
now and then. It's a beautiful day.
How can I be expected to handle
high school?"
73,FERRIS,73,"I do actually have a test. That wasn't
bullshit."
74,FERRIS,74,That I care about it was.
75,FERRIS,75,"It's on European socialism. I mean,
really. What's the point? I'm not
European. I don't plan to be European.
So, who gives a shit if they're socialists?
They could be fascist anarchists and it
still wouldn't change the fact that I
don't own a car."
76,FERRIS,76,"WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY,
TWIST AND SHOUT..."
77,FERRIS,77,"Not that I condone fascism. Or
and ""isms"". ""Isms"", in my opinion
are not good. A person should not
believe in an ""ism"". He should
believe in himself. John Lennon
said it on his first solo album.
""I don't believe in Beatles, I
just believe in me."" A good point
there. Afterall, he was the Walrus."
78,FERRIS,78,"I could be the Walrus and I'd still
have to bum rides off people."
79,FERRIS (OC),79,"I'm not very political? Let me
put that into perspective..."
80,FERRIS,80,"My uncle went to Canada to protest
the war, right? On the Fourth of
July he was down with my aunt and he
got drunk and told my Dad he felt
guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam.
So I said, ""What's the deal, Uncle
Jeff? In wartime you want to be a
pacifist and in peacetime you want
to be a soldier. It took you twenty
years to find out you don't believe
in anything?"""
81,FERRIS,81,Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks.
82,FERRIS,82,"Be careful when you deal with old
hippies. They can be real touchy."
83,FERRIS,83,"My mother was a hippie. But she
lost it. She got old. If she listens
to the White Album now? She doesn't hear
music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is
her favorite drug. It'll probably be
mine, too. I hope not."
84,FERRIS,84,"In eighth grade a friend of mine
made a bong out of one of these.
The smoke tasted like glue."
85,FERRIS,85,"His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a
serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I
like him. I'm probably his only friend.
I do what I can for him. I mean, if
I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others,
right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.
His father's dead and his sister's rumored
to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit.
She only puts out so people will hang out
with her. It's sad but I don't hold it
against her. Better to hold it against the
guys who use her and don't care about her."
86,FERRIS,86,"My parents never allowed Garth over here.
It was because of his family. Mainly his
older brother. He's in jail. I could see them
not wanting his brother here because he is
a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.
I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of
artificial fruit just so he could see what
it was like to have his stomach pumped.
But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault
that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights
with the parents on that point. I always felt
for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once
and I was laying on the dark worrying that
his brother was going to come in and hack me
to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying.
I asked him what was wrong and he said, ""Nothing"".
... Nothing was wrong. There was no
specific thing he was crying about.
In fact, he wasn't really even aware that
he was crying. He just cried himself to
sleep every night. It was a habit. The
guy's so conditioned to grief that if
he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How
could you possibly dump on guy who has to
deal with that kinda shit? My parents
acknowledge the trudge of the situation
and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel
for him but still the guy's banned from
our house."
87,FERRIS,87,"Unfortunately, now my parents have a
legit argument. Garth doesn't need his
brother to give him a rep anymore. He's
getting one on his own. He's lost. It's
over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from
school. Gone from life. His legacy is
a gas station."
88,FERRIS,88,"One very serious danger is playing
sick is that it's possible to believe
your own act."
89,FERRIS,89,"That and boredom. Alot of people
ditch and feel great for about an
hour. Then they realize there's
nothing to do. TV and food. I myself
have ditched and gotten so bored I
did homework. Figure that shit out."
90,FERRIS,90,"You have to plan things out before
you take the day off. Otherwise
you get all nervous worrying about
what to do and all you get is grief
and the whole point is to take it
easy, cut loose and enjoy."
91,FERRIS,91,"You blow your day and at about three
o'clock, when everybody's out of school,
you're going to wish you'd gone to
school so you could be out having
fun."
92,FERRIS,92,"Avoid the misery. Plan your day.
Do it right."
93,FERRIS,93,"There's alot of pressure at work
in my age group. And it's not always
recognized."
94,FERRIS,94,"Some guy whose hair is falling out
and his stomach's hanging over his
belt and everything he eats makes
him fart, he looks at someone like
me and thinks, ""This kid's young and
strong and has a full, rich future ahead
of him, what's he got to bitch about?"""
95,FERRIS,95,"That's just one reason why I need a
day off every now and then."
96,CAMERON,96,Food...shelter...no...yes...
97,CAMERON,97,Hello?
98,FERRIS' VOICE,98,Cameron! What's happening?
99,CAMERON,99,Very little.
100,FERRIS' VOICE,100,How do you feel?
101,CAMERON,101,Shredded.
102,FERRIS' VOICE,102,Is your mother in the room?
103,CAMERON,103,She's not home. Where are you?
104,FERRIS' VOICE,104,Home.
105,FERRIS,105,"I'm taking the day off. Get
dressed and come over."
106,CAMERON'S VOICE,106,I can't. I'm sick.
107,FERRIS,107,It's all in your head. Come on over.
108,CAMERON,108,"I feel like complete shit, Ferris.
I can't go anywhere."
109,FERRIS' VOICE,109,"I'm sorry to hear that. Now, come
on over and pick me up."
110,CAMERON,110,I'm dying.
111,FERRIS' VOICE,111,"You're not dying. You just can't think
of anything good to do."
112,FERRIS,112,"If anybody needs a day off, it's
Cameron. He has alot of things to
sort out before he graduates. He
can't be wound this tight and go
to college. His roommate'll kill
him. I've come close myself. But I
like him. He's a little easier to
take when you know why he's like he
is. The boy cannot relax. Pardon
by French but Cameron is so tight
that if you stuck a lump of coal up
his ass, in two weeks you'd have a
diamond."
113,FERRIS,113,"And Cameron would worry that he'd
owe taxes on it."
114,TEACHER'S VOICE,114,Albers?
115,BOY'S VOICE,115,Here.
116,TEACHER'S VOICE,116,Anderson.
117,GIRL'S VOICE,117,Here.
118,TEACHER'S VOICE,118,Anheiser?
119,BOY'S VOICE,119,Here.
120,TEACHER'S VOICE,120,Busch?
121,GIRL'S VOICE,121,Here.
122,TEACHER'S VOICE,122,Bueller?
123,TEACHER'S VOICE,123,Bueller?
124,GIRL'S VOICE,124,He's sick.
125,GIRL'S VOICE,125,"My best friend's sister's boyfriend's
brother's girlfriend heard from this
guy who knows this kid who's going
with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out
at 31 Flavors last night. I guess
it's pretty serious."
126,TEACHER'S VOICE,126,"Thank you, Simone."
127,GIRL'S VOICE,127,No problem whatsoever.
128,TEACHER'S VOICE,128,Drucker?
129,BOY'S VOICE,129,What?
130,FERRIS,130,This is really degrading.
131,FERRIS,131,"Financing my activities this way.
Very damaging to the self-image.
But, hey, I'm broke. In times of
crisis one must to what one must
to. I'll pay it back. With interest."
132,FERRIS,132,"Regardless of how much shit sisters
make you eat, how often they rat on
you, how gross they act or how wicked
and insensitive they can be, you should
not alientate them. Because most likely
they have cash and it's usually very easy
to get your hands on."
133,JOYCE,133,"No one's going to consider a
house with a black living room.
Not even those jerks from Vermont.
Let's be realistic."
134,AGENT 1,134,"Mrs. Volbeck's dead set against
putting any money into the house."
135,JOYCE,135,Joyce Bueller.
136,JOYCE,136,"Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I
completely forgot to call."
137,MAN'S VOICE,137,"Are you aware that your son is not
in school today?"
138,JOYCE'S VOICE,138,"Yes, I am. Ferris is home sick. I
had a meeting first thing this
morning. I should have called. It
completely slipped my mind."
139,DEAN'S VOICE,139,"Are you also aware that Ferris does not
have what we consider an exemplary
attendance record?"
140,JOYCE'S VOICE,140,I don't understand.
141,DEAN'S VOICE,141,I just had his file up.
142,ROONEY,142,"I just has his file up, Mrs. Bueller."
143,ROONEY,143,"If Ferris thinks he coast this last
month and still graduate, he's sorely
mistaken."
144,JOYCE'S VOICE,144,This is all news to me.
145,ROONEY'S VOICE,145,"So far this semester alone, he's been
absent nine times. Including today."
146,JOYCE'S VOICE,146,Nine times?
147,ROONEY,147,"I have it right here in front of me. He's
missed..."
148,FERRIS,148,"I wanted a car. I got a computer. How's
that for being born under a bad sign?"
149,JOYCE,149,"I can give you every assurance that
Ferris is home and that he is, in
fact, very ill. I debated whether
or not I should even leave him.
I can appreciate that at this time
of year children are prone to taking
the day off, but in Ferris' case,
he's truly a very sick boy."
150,GIRL,150,I'm really sorry about your brother.
151,JEANIE,151,"What're you sorry for? I have to live
with the trouser snake."
152,GIRL,152,"No, I mean I heard he's really sick."
153,JEANIE,153,Who said he's sick.
154,GIRL,154,"A whole bunch of people. They said
he's like on the verge of death."
155,GIRL,155,"This guy in my biology class said
that if Ferris dies he's giving
his eyes to Stevie Wonder? He's
really sweet isn't he?"
156,FERRIS,156,"A sample of my blood was sent
to Atlanta to the Center for
Disease Control. I don't know,
man, I'm bricking heavily."
157,FERRIS,157,Freshman.
158,(to the phone),158,"Did you see Alien? When the guy
had the creature in his stomach?
It feels like that."
159,BOY,159,Goddamn! Are you kidding?
160,SECOND BOY,160,What?
161,BOY,161,Did you see Alien?
162,SECOND BOY,162,No.
163,BOY,163,You never rented the video cassette?
164,BOY,164,Oh. He's really wasted.
165,THIRD BOY,165,Who's he talking to?
166,SECOND BOY,166,Ferris Bueller. You know him?
167,THIRD BOY,167,"Yeah. He's getting me out of summer
school."
168,BOY,168,"Anyway, I appreciate you letting us
know how you're doing. We gotta split."
169,BOY,169,"Huh?...Yeah, sure. Hold on."
170,SECOND BOY,170,"Shit. I hope he doesn't die.
I can't handle summer school."
171,BOY,171,Did you see Alien?
172,GIRL,172,"Yeah, why?"
173,GIRL,173,Hello?
174,GIRL,174,Who?
175,GIRL,175,"Hi, Ferris. How's your bod?"
176,GIRL,176,"Oh, my God! You're dying?
Is it serious?"
177,GIRL,177,Shiit! Are you upset?
178,ROONEY,178,"I don't trust this kid any further
than I can throw him!"
179,SECRETARY,179,"With your bad knee, you better
not throw anybody, Ed."
180,ROONEY,180,"What's so dangerous about a character
like Ferris Bueller is that he gives
the good kids bad ideas. The last thing
I need at this point in my career is
fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples
running around these halls."
181,SECRETARY,181,"He's very popular, Ed. Sportos, motorheads,
geeks, sluts, pinheads, dweebies, wonkers,
richies, they all adore him."
182,ROONEY,182,"That's exactly why I have to catch him
this time. To show these kids that the
example he sets is a first class ticket
to nowhere."
183,SECRETARY,183,"Ooo. You sounded like Dirty Harry just
now."
184,ROONEY,184,Really?
185,FERRIS,185,"Cameron, if you're not over here
in fifteen minutes, you can find
a new best friend. I'm serious, man.
This is bullshit, making me wait
around the house for you."
186,CAMERON,186,"I'm sick. I feel like shit. Why can't
you leave me alone?"
187,FERRIS' VOICE,187,"You're not up for some good times?
It's a beautiful day. It's almost
summer. If this was Hawaii, we'd be
surfing."
188,FERRIS,188,"You want to stay home and try
to have the shits? Try to barf?
Try to feel worse?"
189,CAMERON'S VOICE,189,I don't have to try.
190,FERRIS,190,"Be a man. Take some Pepto Bismol
and get dressed. You're boring me
with this stuff."
191,FERRIS,191,"Squeeze you buns for a second. I
got another call."
192,FERRIS,192,H--hell-o?
193,TOM'S VOICE,193,Ferris?
194,TOM,194,You sound miserable.
195,FERRIS' VOICE,195,Really? Darn! I thought I was improving.
196,TOM,196,Were you sleeping?
197,FERRIS' VOICE,197,I was trying to do some homework.
198,FERRIS (OC),198,I'm so worried about falling behind.
199,FERRIS,199,Dad? Can you hold on a second?
200,TOM'S VOICE,200,"Sure, pal. Are you alright?"
201,FERRIS,201,"Just a little phlegm on the phone.
Hold on."
202,FERRIS,202,Cameron? It's my Dad.
203,CAMERON'S VOICE,203,"Oh, that's just great. Are you busted?"
204,FERRIS,204,"It's completely cool. He's just
checking up on me. Now, listen to
me. I'm working on getting some
heavy bucks out of him. So, the least you
can do is hurry up and get over here.
Bye."
205,FERRIS,205,"Sorry, Dad. The moment before you
called, I had a chest spasm and I
blew lung fluid all over the place.
It was making me ill looking at it.
But gee, it's sure great of you to call.
I'm sure there're alot of fathers
who wouldn't take time out from
their busy schedules to call a dumb,
sick teenager."
206,TOM'S VOICE,206,"Hey, pal, what was I supposed to do?"
207,FERRIS,207,"Give yourself some credit, Dad. It
was a mammoth gesture. It's like those
savings bonds you used to give me
every Christmas."
208,FERRIS,208,It was that kind of concern.
209,FERRIS,209,"You had to work hard for the money
to buy those things, right?"
210,TOM'S VOICE,210,Not any harder than anybody else.
211,FERRIS,211,"You work so hard I'll bet you don't
even remember where those bonds are,
right?"
212,TOM'S VOICE,212,Wrong.
213,FERRIS,213,"Oh, yeah? You're pulling my leg. You're
just trying to cheer me up."
214,TOM'S VOICE,214,"Like hell I am. They're in a shoebox
in my closet."
215,FERRIS,215,"Was that a class move or what?
The guy gave it up faster than
a drunk Catholic girl. I hope my
kids don't pull this shit on me."
216,FERRIS,216,"Of course, if they didn't, they'd
be dumb and abnormal and they'd
probably never move out of my
house and I'd have to support them
until I die. I take it back."
217,FERRIS,217,"Dad? All this talking has made me
kind of light-headed. I think
I better lie down."
218,TOM'S VOICE,218,"Okay, pal. You take care. I'll
call you after lunch."
219,FERRIS,219,"You don't have to, Dad."
220,TOM'S VOICE,220,I want to. Bye now.
221,FERRIS,221,"You win some, you lose some."
222,FERRIS,222,"I'm so disappointed in Cameron.
Twenty bucks says he's sitting
in his car debating about whether
or not he should go out."
223,CAMERON,223,"We're gonna get caught. No doubt
about it."
224,CAMERON,224,I'm not doing it.
225,CAMERON,225,"He'll keep calling until I come
over."
226,CAMERON,226,"Actually, what'll happen is I'll
get caught. Ferris'll escape."
227,FERRIS,227,"Cameron'll go on like that for a
good thirty minutes. The guy
is a shellfish when it comes to
making a decision. The reason
he doesn't fell good is, he
worries about everything. He's
the only guy I know who's deeply
concerned that when he grows up
there'll be a critical shortage
of strategic metals."
228,FERRIS,228,"Cameron's also the only guy
I know who knows what strategic
metals are."
229,FERRIS,229,Pardon moi.
230,FERRIS,230,"MAYBE I'M JUST LIKE MY MOTHER,
SHE'S NEVER SATISFIED..."
231,TEACHER,231,"Roosevelt's health had seriously
deteriorated by the time he met
with Churchill and Stalin at Yalta."
232,TEACHER,232,Pardon me.
233,NURSE,233,Sloane Peterson?
234,NURSE,234,"May I see you outside for a moment?
There's been an emergency."
235,SLOANE,235,Dead grandmother.
236,NURSE,236,Dead grandmother.
237,ROONEY,237,Dead grandmother?
238,SECRETARY,238,"That's what Mr. Peterson said. I
had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane."
239,ROONEY,239,Who's this girl's going with?
240,SECRETARY,240,"It's so hard to tell. I see her
alot with Ferris Bueller."
241,ROONEY,241,"Could you get me Mr. Peterson's
daytime number?"
242,SECRETARY,242,Edward Rooney's office.
243,SECRETARY,243,Yes. Can you hold? Thank you.
244,SECRETARY,244,It's Mr. Peterson.
245,SECRETARY,245,Do you still want his number?
246,ROONEY,246,Ed Rooney.
247,MAN'S VOICE,247,Ed? This is George Peterson.
248,ROONEY,248,"How are you today, sir?"
249,MAN'S VOICE,249,"We've had a bit of bad luck this
morning as you may have heard."
250,ROONEY,250,"I heard. And, gosh, I'm all broken
up. Huh? Oh, sure. I'd be happy to
release Sloane. You produce a corpse
and I'll release Sloane. I want to
see this dead grandmother firsthand."
251,ROONEY,251,"It's Ferris Bueller. Nervy litttle
punk. I'm gonna set a trap and let
his walk right into it!"
252,ROONEY,252,"That's right. Cart the stiff in and
I'll turn over your daughter. It's
school policy. Was this your mother?"
253,SECRETARY,253,Ed Rooney's office.
254,SECRETARY,254,"Hold, please."
255,ROONEY,255,"I'll tell you want, you don't
like my policies, you can just
come on down and smooch by big
old ugly ass. You hear me?"
256,ROONEY,256,What!?
257,SECRETARY,257,Ferris Bueller's on line two.
258,FERRIS,258,"Mr. Rooney? I'm sorry to disturb
you at work but I was wondering if
it would be possible for my sister
to bring home any assignments from
my classes that I may need."
259,FERRIS' VOICE,259,"Thank you, sir."
260,CAMERON,260,"You oughta be sorry for Christ's
sake! A family member dies and
you insult me. What's the matter
with you, anyway?"
261,ROONEY,261,"I don't know. I thought you were
someone else. You have to know,
sir, that I would never deliberately
insult you. I can't begin to tell
you how embarrassed I am."
262,CAMERON'S VOICE,262,Pardon my French but you're an asshole!
263,ROONEY,263,Absolutely! I most certainly am.
264,CAMERON,264,"This isn't over yet, buster. You
just make sure my daughter's out
in front of the school in ten
minutes. Do you read me?"
265,ROONEY'S VOICE,265,"Load and clear, Mr. Peterson."
266,CAMERON,266,"Call me sir, goddamn it!"
267,ROONEY'S VOICE,267,Sir.
268,CAMERON,268,That's better.
269,CAMERON,269,"I'm scared shitless, Ferris! What
is Rooney guesses my voice!"
270,FERRIS,270,Impossible. You're doing great.
271,CAMERON,271,"I don't have all day to bark at you
so I'll make this short and sweet."
272,FERRIS,272,Great!
273,CAMERON,273,"I want my daughter out in front
of the school in ten minutes. By
herself. I don's want anyone around..."
274,CAMERON,274,What'd I do?
275,FERRIS,275,"Out in front my herself? It's too
suspicious! He'll think something's
up, moron. Cover it."
276,CAMERON,276,You do it!
277,FERRIS,277,Talk!
278,CAMERON,278,"I changed my mind, fella. You be out
in front with her! I wanna have a
few words with you!"
279,CAMERON'S VOICE,279,"On second thought, I don't have
time to talk to you. We'll get
together soon and have lunch."
280,CAMERON,280,Why'd you hit me?!
281,FERRIS,281,Where's your brain?!
282,CAMERON,282,Why'd you hit me?!
283,FERRIS,283,Where's your brain?!
284,CAMERON,284,Why'd you hit me?
285,FERRIS,285,Where's your brain?
286,CAMERON,286,I asked you first.
287,FERRIS,287,"How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney's
going to be there with her?!"
288,CAMERON,288,"I said for her to be there alone
and you freaked!"
289,FERRIS,289,"My, God, you're so stupid!"
290,FERRIS,290,"I didn't hit you, I lightly slapped
you."
291,CAMERON,291,"You hit me. Look, don't ask me to
participate in your crap if you
don't like the way I do it!"
292,CAMERON,292,"I was home, sick. You get me out of
bed, being me over here, make me
jeopardize my future, make me do
a phoney phone call on a dean of
students, a man who could squeeze
my nuts into oblivion and then
you deliberately hurt my feelings."
293,FERRIS,293,I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.
294,CAMERON,294,"Oh, really?"
295,FERRIS,295,"Yeah, really."
296,CAMERON,296,"Hey, Ferris? Have a nice life."
297,FERRIS,297,Cameron?
298,CAMERON,298,"Stick it up your ass, Ferris."
299,FERRIS,299,"Cameron, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to jam you. It was uncalled for."
300,CAMERON,300,You're serious?
301,FERRIS,301,Dead serious.
302,CAMERON,302,Thanks.
303,FERRIS,303,"You did screw up through, right?
Not that is was necessarily all
you fault. Right?"
304,CAMERON,304,Why?
305,FERRIS,305,"To fix this situation, I'm going
to have to ask you for a small favor."
306,CAMERON,306,"1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California. Less
than a hundred were made. It has a
market value of $265,000. My father
spent three years restoring it. It
is joy, it is his love, it is his
passion."
307,FERRIS,307,"It is his fault he didn't lock the
garage."
308,CAMERON,308,"Ferris, my father loves this car more
than life itself. We can't take is out."
309,FERRIS,309,"A man with priorities so far out of
whack doesn't deserve such a fine
automobile."
310,CAMERON,310,"He never drives it, Ferris. He just
rubs it with a diaper."
311,FERRIS,311,"We can't pick up Sloane in your car,
Cameron. Rooney'd never believe Mr.
Peterson drives that piece of shit."
312,CAMERON,312,It's not a piece of shit.
313,FERRIS,313,"It's a piece of shit. Don't worry
about it. I don't even have a piece
of shit. I have to envy yours. Look,
I'm sorry but there's nothing else
we can do."
314,CAMERON,314,"He knows the mileage, Ferris. He has
it tatooed on his wrist."
315,FERRIS,315,He doesn't trust you?
316,CAMERON,316,No.
317,FERRIS,317,"Alright, look, this is real simple."
318,FERRIS,318,"Whatever miles we put on it, we'll
take off."
319,CAMERON,319,How?
320,FERRIS,320,We'll drive home backwards.
321,CAMERON,321,"Forget it. I'm putting my foot down,
Ferris. You'll have to think of
something else..."
322,CAMERON'S VOICE,322,"...You're not talking me into this
one. I have to live with the man.
I'm sorry but..."
323,CAMERON,323,"Are you crazy?! Put the top back
up!"
324,FERRIS,324,This is perfect top-down weather.
325,CAMERON,325,What about Rooney?
326,FERRIS,326,"Cameron, the more obvious we are,
the less likely we are to get
caught."
327,CAMERON,327,That makes no sense whatsoever.
328,FERRIS,328,"The adult mind is a suspicious
machine."
329,FERRIS,329,"Stay down, man."
330,CAMERON,330,"Howcome it's my Dad's car and
I'm taking all the risk and I have
to ride back here?"
331,FERRIS,331,I don't have an explanation.
332,ROONEY,332,"Once again let me say how deeply
saddened I am by your loss."
333,SLOANE,333,Huh?
334,ROONEY,334,Were you close to your grandmother?
335,SLOANE,335,"Oh. Um. Yeah. Very. She was a terrific
lady. Very hip. Very old. Yeah."
336,DEEP VOICE,336,"Oh, Sloane! Dear!"
337,FERRIS,337,Hurry along now!
338,SLOANE,338,"I guess that's my Dad. Thanks.
See ya."
339,SLOANE,339,"This is so great! I can't believe
it! Right in front of Rooney!"
340,SLOANE,340,"Hi, Cameron. You comfortable?"
341,CAMERON,341,Hi. No.
342,SLOANE,342,What a fabulous car!
343,CAMERON,343,Enjoy it quick. It' s going home.
344,FERRIS,344,"It was risky, it was bold but
it was totally necessary."
345,SLOANE,345,What're we gonna do?
346,FERRIS,346,"The question isn't ""what are we
gonna do"", the question is ""what
aren't we going to do."""
347,CAMERON,347,"Don't tell me we're not going to
take the car home. Please."
348,FERRIS,348,"If you had access to a car like this
would you take it back right away?
Would you give up feeling like a
ton just to ease your best friend's
tension?"
349,FERRIS,349,Either would I.
350,TELLER,350,Ferris Bueller?
351,FERRIS,351,"Hello, Mrs. Froeling. How are you?"
352,TELLER,352,"I passed a kidney stone Tuesday, so
I'm a little pooped but other than
that, I'm as chipper as can be."
353,TELLER,353,"Say, should you be in school?"
354,FERRIS,354,Me?
355,FERRIS,355,"I'm out of school, Mrs. Froeling.
In fact. I'm married. This is my
wife...Madonna."
356,FERRIS,356,"And this is my brother-in-law,
ZZ Top. ZZ, this is Mrs. Froeling."
357,TELLER,357,Is Top a Slavic name?
358,CAMERON,358,Yeah.
359,FERRIS,359,"I'd like to cash these in, please.
We're having a baby and we need the
cash for a crib, clothes, diapers,
food pellets, leash, water dish..."
360,TELLER,360,A baby!
361,TELLER,361,You must be so excited.
362,SLOANE,362,"I'm thrilled, ma'am. I'm especially
looking forward to wearing those
jeans with the stretch panel in
front."
363,TELLER,363,"Are you hoping for a boy or
a girl?"
364,SLOANE,364,"Actually, we're hoping for a car."
365,CAMERON,365,Shit...
366,TELLER,366,"These bonds aren't mature. If you hold
onto them another two years you'll get
an additional four dollars..."
367,FERRIS,367,I'm aware of that.
368,TELLER,368,You're throwing away four dollars.
369,FERRIS,369,"No, ma'am, I'm giving it to the
government. They need it. Do you
know what an aircraft carrier's
going for these days?"
370,JOYCE,370,"Mrs. Froeling, how are you?"
371,MRS. FROELING,371,I passed a kidney stone Tuesday.
372,MRS. FROELING,372,"Say, you must be very proud."
373,MRS. FROELING,373,I met Madonna.
374,MRS. FROELING,374,"She told me everything. Keep me posted,
I'll want to send a gift."
375,JOYCE,375,"My son's home sick today. If
you wouldn't mind, on our way
back to the office, I'd like
to just run in and check up on him."
376,MOTHER,376,Of course.
377,SECRETARY,377,This is the Peterson's home.
378,SECRETARY,378,Watch your mouth this time.
379,ROONEY,379,"Ferris Bueller's behind this. There's
no doubt in my mind. That's what I was
saying this morning. Why he has to be stopped.
He's got Sloane Peterson involved in this
thing now. See?"
380,SECRETARY,380,"And her grandmother, too."
381,SLOANE,381,"We can't come to the phone right now.
We've had a death in the family. If
you need to reach us we'll be at
the following number..."
382,CAMERON'S VOICE,382,"You have reached the Coughlin Bros.
Mortuary. We are unable to come to
the phone right now but if you'll leave
your name and number..."
383,ROONEY,383,"Something's going on, goddamn it."
384,SECRETARY,384,There's a railroad strike.
385,ROONEY,385,And I'm going to stop it!
386,SECRETARY,386,My brother-in-law'll appreciate it.
387,ROONEY,387,What?
388,SECRETARY,388,"My brother-in-law rides the train
to work."
389,ROONEY,389,Who gives a good goddamn?
390,KID,390,"Yo. We're collecting money to
buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney."
391,KID,391,"They run about fifty g's so it
you could help out..."
392,JEANIE,392,Go piss up a flagpole!
393,KID,393,Huh?
394,KID,394,"Hey, babe! Some day you might
need a favor from Ferris Bueller!
Then where'll you be?!"
395,KID,395,Heartless wench...
396,CAMERON,396,We can't leave the car here!
397,FERRIS,397,Why not?
398,CAMERON,398,"Because we can't! I want it back
home where it belongs!"
399,SLOANE,399,What could happen to it?
400,CAMERON,400,"It could get stolen, wrecked, scratched,
you name it."
401,FERRIS,401,I'll give the guy a five to watch it.
402,CAMERON,402,What guy?
403,FERRIS,403,You speak English?
404,ATTENDANT,404,Since I was three.
405,FERRIS,405,"Great. I want to you take extra special
care of this vehicle, okay?"
406,ATTENDANT,406,Like it's a beautiful woman.
407,FERRIS,407,I appreciate it.
408,FERRIS,408,"See what a finski can do to
a person's attitude? He's going
to treat it like a beautiful
woman."
409,CAMERON,409,"Yeah, sure. Whip it with a stick
and piss on the hood."
410,SLOANE,410,"Oh, please, Cameron. Do you have to
be so graphic?"
411,SLOANE,411,This is so right!
412,FERRIS (VO),412,"This is the world's tallest building.
From our vantage point here on the
103 floor, we are provided with a
view of four states."
413,CAMERON (VO),413,Do you think the car's alright?
414,FERRIS (VO),414,"Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and
my personal favorite, Indiana."
415,CAMERON,415,"I don't feel good, Ferris. Are
we gonna stay long?"
416,FERRIS,416,Take a step back...
417,FERRIS,417,"Now, lean against the glass. Like
this..."
418,FERRIS,418,And look down.
419,SLOANE,419,"Oh, shit!"
420,SLOANE,420,What if the glass gives?
421,FERRIS,421,Death.
422,SLOANE,422,Cool.
423,CAMERON,423,I think I see my Dad.
424,CAMERON'S FATHER,424,I think I see my car.
425,FERRIS AND SLOANE,425,"I BEEN ALL 'ROUND THIS GREAT BIG WORLD
AND I'VE SEEN ALL KINDS OF GIRLS
YEAH, BUT I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET
BACK IN THE STATES
BACK TO THE CUTEST GIRLS IN THE WORLD
I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA
I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA"
426,FERRIS AND SLOANE,426,I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA GIRLS!
427,SLOANE,427,Do you love me?
428,FERRIS,428,Do you love me?
429,SLOANE,429,I asked you first.
430,FERRIS,430,Yes. You?
431,SLOANE,431,Yes.
432,FERRIS,432,"Would I trash a day of education to
be with you if I didn't love you?"
433,SLOANE,433,Yes.
434,FERRIS,434,"Would I risk damaging a deep and
wonderfully enriching relationship
with my parents if I didn't love you?"
435,SLOANE,435,Yes.
436,FERRIS,436,"Would I have introduced you as my wife
if I didn't love you?"
437,SLOANE,437,Wait a minute. That was a lie.
438,FERRIS,438,True.
439,FERRIS,439,"Would you want to get married? I
mean if I wasn't an asshole."
440,SLOANE,440,Sure.
441,FERRIS,441,Today?
442,FERRIS,442,I'm game.
443,SLOANE,443,No way!
444,FERRIS,444,"I'll do it, if you will."
445,CAMERON,445,You need a blood test.
446,FERRIS,446,Huh?
447,CAMERON,447,"If your blood's not compatible,
you could produce a pinhead. The
state requires a blood test."
448,FERRIS,448,So?
449,CAMERON,449,"So, you can't get married today."
450,FERRIS,450,Tomorrow?
451,CAMERON,451,If you get a blood test today.
452,SLOANE,452,I'm not getting married.
453,CAMERON,453,"I'm with you, babe."
454,FERRIS,454,Why not?
455,SLOANE,455,"What do you mean, why not? Think
about it."
456,FERRIS,456,"Besides being too young and your
father hating my guts and not
having any place to live and feeling
awkward about being the only cheer-
leader with a husband, give me a
good reason why not."
457,CAMERON,457,"I'll give you two. My mother and
father."
458,CAMERON,458,They're married and they hate each other.
459,CAMERON,459,You've seen them. Am I right?
460,FERRIS,460,"You're father's a toad and your
Mom's always wired out, but so what?
They're old. That's natural."
461,CAMERON,461,"It makes me puke. Seeing people
treat each other like that. It's
like the car. He loves the car.
He hates his wife."
462,SLOANE,462,"My parents are divorced. So what?
It's not like it doesn't happen
ten thousand times a day."
463,CAMERON,463,"Just because it happens doesn't
make it right. Are you comfortable
with it?"
464,SLOANE,464,"No. It's not something I can get comfortable
with. I've tried. Are yours divorced?"
465,CAMERON,465,They may as well be.
466,SLOANE,466,"Do you think they're staying together
because of you?"
467,SLOANE,467,Do they like you?
468,CAMERON,468,Yeah. Sure.
469,SLOANE,469,"Consider this...my father canned me
and my brother and my Mom for a
twenty five year old dipso with fake
tits. He dropped us like a rock. Everything
was cool at our house. I thought so.
We all thought so. Then BLAM! It's over."
470,FERRIS,470,"This is all news to me. She keeps a
pretty good secret."
471,SLOANE,471,"It was pure selfishness. When I have
a kid, I don't care how much I want
something, if it's gonna screw-up the
kid, forget it."
472,FERRIS,472,She's not lying.
473,CAMERON,473,You could change.
474,SLOANE,474,"Yeah. But I'm gonna try not to.
I'm gonna think about it. I'm
gonna try to prevent it."
475,FERRIS,475,"This is optomism. It's a common
trait with my age group. Adults
think it's cute, it's like a charming
quick that infests youth. But it's
a cool thing and I think, deep down,
crusty old shits wish they had some.
They wish they had her, too."
476,FERRIS,476,Sorry. She's taken.
477,CAMERON,477,"I'd rather not have my family break
apart, thank you."
478,SLOANE,478,"Well, you know what? It ain't up
to you. It's out of your hands."
479,CAMERON,479,"So, I in other words, I should just
sit back and watch it crumble?"
480,SLOANE,480,"You're merely an inhabitant in their
universe."
481,FERRIS,481,Frightening choice of words.
482,SLOANE,482,"They call the shots. When you split
from them, you call the shots."
483,CAMERON,483,"So, you're saying I should run away?"
484,FERRIS,484,No. She's saying it's time for lunch.
485,SLOANE,485,What?
486,FERRIS,486,Let's go feed Cameron.
487,FERRIS,487,BUY!
488,ANNOUNCER,488,"Commodity prices rose sharply today
in unusually heavy trading..."
489,MAITRE'D,489,May I help you?
490,FERRIS,490,"Yes. I'm Abe Frohman. Party of
three for 12:00."
491,FERRIS,491,Is there a problem?
492,MAITRE'D,492,You're Abe Frohman?
493,FERRIS,493,I'm Abe Frohman.
494,MAITRE'D,494,"I'm sorry, son. I'm very busy right
now. If you have trouble finding the
door..."
495,FERRIS,495,"Are you suggesting that I'm not
who I say I am?"
496,MAITRE'D,496,Shall I call the police?
497,CAMERON,497,Let's go...Abe.
498,FERRIS,498,I'm not going anywhere.
499,FERRIS,499,"Call the police. Go ahead. Better
yet..."
500,FERRIS,500,...I'll call myself.
501,FERRIS,501,"You touch me and I yell ""rat!""
There's another phone around here.
Find it."
502,CAMERON,502,"Ferris, let's split, please?"
503,SLOANE,503,"Cameron's right. We're gonna
get busted."
504,FERRIS,504,Not a chance in the world.
505,FERRIS,505,Ask for Abe Frohman.
506,MAITRE'D,506,I appreciate your understanding.
507,FERRIS,507,"Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave
us to our repast and all will be
forgotten."
508,MAITRE'D,508,Enjoy your luncheon.
509,FERRIS,509,Thank you.
510,FERRIS,510,"Darling, you were wonderful."
511,SLOANE,511,"Oh, but I had a wonderful teacher."
512,FERRIS,512,"Cameron, dear friend?"
513,FERRIS,513,"And you thought we wouldn't have
any fun. Shame on you."
514,JEANIE (VO),514,Ferris Bueller's days are numbered.
515,JEANIE,515,I'm gonna bust his buns.
516,FRIEND,516,Why? What's the point?
517,JEANIE,517,"Why? Because I'm sick of the little
dope. He manipulates my parents, he
does whatever he wants, whenever he
wants and he never gets nailed."
518,JEANIE,518,"Well, babe, today I'm the hammer."
519,FRIEND,519,I think he's cute.
520,JEANIE,520,"Sweetie, it's an established fact that
you have no taste. Ferris is not cute.
He's not charming. He's not nice. He's
not a wonderful person. He's an ignorant
mule and the sooner everybody in this
school comes to that realization the
better off we'll all be."
521,JEANIE,521,"See? My brother strokes you, you
sympathize with him, I get pissed
off and this is what happens!"
522,JEANIE,522,"Let me tell you something. I study
hard, I work hard, I'm polite, I'm
considerate, I'm friendly and fair
to all kinds of people. Except
morons. I try to be everything a
good, decent person should be and
you know what?"
523,FRIEND,523,Everybody thinks you're an asshole.
524,JEANIE,524,Excuse me?
525,FRIEND,525,I don't think you're an asshole.
526,JEANIE,526,Who does?
527,JEANIE,527,Rachel?
528,JEANIE,528,Rachel's a dirt bag. Who else?
529,FRIEND,529,I don't know. Just forget it.
530,JEANIE,530,"Forget that everybody thinks I'm an
asshole? Would you like everybody to
think you're an asshole?"
531,FRIEND,531,"Not everybody thinks you're an
asshole. Mr. Rooney likes you."
532,JEANIE,532,"Oh, hey. That's exciting. A fat
fifty year old clod with B.O.
likes me."
533,JEANIE,533,"Would everybody be happier if
maybe I were to die in a flaming
car accident or something?"
534,FRIEND,534,"Maybe if you didn't cat like and
asshole..."
535,JEANIE,535,Am I acting like an asshole?
536,FRIEND,536,I didn't mean it that way.
537,JEANIE,537,"I this a conspiracy to shit all
over me or something? Is my brother
behind this? Tell me if he is or I'll
sock your tits."
538,FRIEND,538,"You really do have a problem, Jeanie."
539,JEANIE,539,Me? I have a problem?
540,FRIEND,540,"Somebody who threatens to sock people's
tits has a problem."
541,JEANIE,541,"Alright. How about if I sock your
face?"
542,FRIEND,542,"Take a walk, Jeanie."
543,JEANIE,543,"If it means anything to you, I
have my period! MY BODY'S RIDDING
ITSELF OF OLD EGGS, GODDAMN IT!"
544,JEANIE,544,He's gone. He's over. He's monkey meat.
545,FERRIS,545,"She's a person who views life as
an ordeal that must be endured. Her
body is a transport vehicle for her
anger. I don't know where she gets
this shit. Basically, the family's
pretty cool."
546,FERRIS,546,"I wonder if everybody shoots at
cigarette butts in urinals? Probably
not many women."
547,FERRIS,547,"I used to think that my family was
the only one that had weirdness
in it. It used to worry me. Then I
met Cameron and I saw how his
family functioned."
548,FERRIS,548,"Cameron's home life is really shit.
He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick
all the time. It really upsets him.
What he said about his parents hating
each other? I refuse to sleep over at
his house. His parents fight all the
time. Even when I'm there. Is there
anything worse than being at somebody's
house when their parents are fighting?
It's the absolute height of social
discomfort."
549,FERRIS,549,"When they go after each other, Cameron
tightens up. It's scary. He gets so
wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns
apart with a crowbar. The thing with
taking his old man's car? It's good
for him. It teaches him to deal with
his fear. Plus, and I must
be honest here, I love driving it.
I highly recommend picking one up."
550,CAMERON,550,What is it?
551,SLOANE,551,"I don't know. But it looks like
it's already been eaten and digested."
552,CAMERON,552,"I knew it was a mistake letting
Ferris order for us."
553,FERRIS,553,What are you doing?
554,CAMERON,554,What is this shit?
555,FERRIS,555,You got me. I don't speak French.
556,FERRIS,556,"I think it's a land-based beefoid
creature."
557,FERRIS,557,Splendid.
558,CAMERON,558,Really?
559,FERRIS,559,Superb.
560,FERRIS,560,Good?
561,FERRIS,561,"Yo, Clouseau!"
562,FERRIS,562,"I have a growth on my brain that
causes memory lapses. Could you
tell me what we ordered here?"
563,WAITER,563,Sweetbreads.
564,FERRIS,564,"Uh, huh. And what might that be?"
565,WAITER,565,Pancreas.
566,FERRIS,566,"As in the gland that has important
functions in digestion and metabolism?"
567,FERRIS,567,"...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid
containing digestive enzymes? The home
of the world famous isles of Langerhans?"
568,FERRIS,568,"Check, please!"
569,FERRIS,569,"40,000 restaurants in the downtown
area and I pick the one my father
goes to."
570,CAMERON,570,"We're gonna get nabbed, for sure."
571,FERRIS,571,"No way, Cameron. Only the meek
get nabbed. The bold survive.
Let's go."
572,SLOANE,572,I wonder if he has a name?
573,FERRIS,573,Ninth Month.
574,CAMERON (VO),574,Are you guys worried about nuclear war?
575,FERRIS (VO),575,"Cameron, it's a beautiful day, we've
won our freedom, we're traveling down
one of American's most scenic polluted
waterways and you have to bring up
nuclear war?"
576,SLOANE (VO),576,"It is kind of raggy subject, Cam."
577,CAMERON (VO),577,"Regardless. It's with us every day.
The possiblity of global destruction."
578,SLOANE (VO),578,"Don't you think it's an issue because
people need something to worry about?
They have to like, have some major
problem that puts all their little
bullshit into some kind of persepective?"
579,CAMERON (VO),579,Maybe.
580,FERRIS,580,"They used to have Viet Nam. They
used to have the oil crisis stuff
and Iran. That's over and people
have to have their big issue. It's
not like somebody came up with the
nuclear holocaust yesterday at
noon, you know."
581,SLOANE (VO),581,"To answer your question...No, I'm not
worried about it at all."
582,FERRIS (VO),582,"We don't know when the bombs going
off. We do know, however, that college
starts in the fall."
583,CAMERON (VO),583,Do you know what a nuclear winter is?
584,SLOANE (VO),584,"Yeah. Everybody's dead, it's real
cold and the skiing's for shit."
585,SLOANE,585,"My step-father's always going off about
how when he was young he was committed to
all these causes."
586,FERRIS,586,"He's full of shit. All the old hippies
are full of shit."
587,SLOANE,587,"He says I don't care about things like
he did."
588,FERRIS,588,What's he care about now?
589,SLOANE,589,"Baldness, fatty meats and money."
590,FERRIS,590,I rest my case.
591,CAMERON,591,"What's spooky is they still control
everything. They took over when they
were young and they never gave it up."
592,FERRIS,592,"One of the most frightening experiences
of my young life has been observing
my parents and our neighbors playing
the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits.
It's chilling to see people crazed with
the minutia of their past."
593,CAMERON,593,"It's human nature to like what you had
better than what you have."
594,SLOANE,594,Agreed.
595,LOUDSPEAKER,595,"TO YOUR LEFT IT THE WORLD'S TALLEST
BUILDING..."
596,"LOUDSPEAKER, FERRIS,
SLOANE, CAMERON",596,The Sears Tower.
597,CAMERON,597,"You know, this is all very interesting
but I'm starving."
598,FERRIS,598,An hour ago you wanted to yack.
599,CAMERON,599,I feel better now.
600,FERRIS,600,Lean over and grab a fish.
601,SLOANE,601,What comes after a nuclear winter?
602,FERRIS,602,Nuclear spring.
603,JEANIE,603,"It's reprehensible to squeal on
your own flesh and blood...but it's
for his own good. His cavalier
attitude will get him into trouble
later in life...and it'll continue
to piss me off and I'll get so
wadded-up that it'll cause cervex cancer
and he'll ruin my life. Screw him."
604,SECRETARY,604,"Hello, Jeanie. Who's bothering
you now?"
605,JEANIE,605,Is Dean Rooney in?
606,SECRETARY,606,"I'm sorry, he's out. Can I help you?"
607,JEANIE,607,I seriously doubt it. When's he back?
608,SECRETARY,608,"I don't know. He left the grounds
on personal business."
609,ROONEY (OC),609,"I've been waiting a long time
for this."
610,ROONEY (OC),610,Your ass is mine.
611,ROONEY,611,What's the score?
612,HOT DOG MAN,612,Zero to zero.
613,ROONEY,613,Who's winning?
614,HOT DOG MAN,614,Cubs.
615,FERRIS,615,I think I broke my thumb.
616,SLOANE,616,Can we leave now?
617,FERRIS,617,You want to leave? We just got here.
618,SLOANE,618,"You got a call, you broke your thumb,
what's left to do?"
619,SLOANE,619,No wonder you're always sick.
620,FERRIS,620,"Do you realize that if I played by
the rules, right now I'd be in gym?"
621,JEANIE,621,"I can't believe my brother's making
me put myself in a position where I
could get expelled. Selfish little
moron."
622,JEANIE,622,"Ferris? You're overshadowed
me long enough. I'm gonna get
you, buddy."
623,SLOANE,623,I love him.
624,CAMERON,624,It's hard not to.
625,CAMERON,625,Stop...water...want...
626,SLOANE,626,Do you believe in reincarnation?
627,CAMERON,627,Huh?
628,SLOANE,628,Do you believe that you lived before?
629,CAMERON,629,Yeah. Sort of.
630,SLOANE,630,DO you ever wonder what you were?
631,CAMERON,631,I don't have to wonder. I know.
632,CAMERON,632,I was a tractor tire.
633,FERRIS,633,"Guten tag, dude!"
634,CAMERON,634,What were you in a previous life?
635,SLOANE,635,"I'm not sure but I think I know
who Ferris was."
636,CAMERON,636,Hannibal.
637,SLOANE,637,From the A-Team?
638,CAMERON,638,"No. The guy who rode the elephants
into Switzerland."
639,SLOANE,639,"I think if he was anybody, he
was Magellan. You know, the guy
who went around the world."
640,SLOANE,640,"I could see him ignoring popular
belief and taking off on some
impossible mission."
641,CAMERON,641,"Yeah. As long as I've known him,
everything works for him. There's
nothing he can't handle. I can't
handle anything. School, parents,
the future. Ferris can do anything."
642,FERRIS,642,"WELL, SHAKE IT UP, BABY, NOW!"
643,GIRLS,643,"SHAKE IT UP, BABY"
644,FERRIS,644,TWIST AND SHOUT!
645,GIRLS,645,TWIST AND SHOUT!
646,FERRIS,646,"COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, BABY ON!
COME ON AND WORK IT ON OUT!"
647,GIRLS,647,WORK IT ON OUT!
648,SLOANE,648,"The future's worse for a boy, isn't
it?"
649,SLOANE,649,"A girl can always bail out and
have a baby and get some guy
to support her."
650,CAMERON,650,That's a pretty grim thought.
651,SLOANE,651,"True, but it's an option. No options
is worse."
652,CAMERON,652,I don't know what I'm gonna do.
653,SLOANE,653,College.
654,CAMERON,654,"Yeah, but to do what?"
655,SLOANE,655,What are you interested in?
656,CAMERON,656,Nothing.
657,SLOANE,657,Me either.
658,CAMERON,658,"What do you think Ferris is gonna
do?"
659,POLICE OFFICER,659,YOU KNOW YOU LOOK SO GOOD!
660,PUNKS,660,LOOK SO GOOD!
661,WOMAN,661,YOU KNOW YOU LOOK SO FINE!
662,TODDLERS,662,LOOK SO FINE!
663,TEENAGER,663,COME ON AND TWIST A LITTLE CLOSER!
664,NEWSPAPER SELLER,664,TWIST A LITTLE CLOSER!
665,CHOIR,665,AND LET ME KNOW THAT YOU'RE MINE!
666,STREET CLEANERS,666,KNOW THAT YOU'RE MINE!
667,POLITICIANS AND WIVES,667,AH!
668,CLERGYMEN,668,AH!
669,VETERANS,669,AH!
670,FERRIS,670,AH!
671,PARADE,671,AHHHHH!
672,FERRIS,672,Who is it?
673,ROONEY,673,"This is Ed Rooney, Ferris. I'd
like to have a word with you."
674,FERRIS' VOICE,674,"I'm sorry I can't come to the door
right now. I'm very ill and I'm
afraid that in my weakened condition,
I could take a nasty spill down the
stairs and subject myself to further
school absenses."
675,ROONEY,675,B.S. Come down here.
676,FERRIS' VOICE,676,"You can reach my parents at their
places of business. Thank you for
stopping by. I appreciate your concern
for my well-being. It will be remembered
long after this illness has past."
677,ROONEY,677,"I'm not leaving until you come
down and talk to me."
678,FERRIS' VOICE,678,Have a nice day.
679,ROONEY,679,"I'm not leaving, Ferris."
680,FERRIS' VOICE,680,Who is it?
681,ROONEY,681,Don't get smart with me Ferris!
682,FERRIS' VOICE,682,"I'm sorry I can't come to the door
right now. I'm very ill and I'm
afraid that in my weakened condition..."
683,FERRIS' VOICE,683,"You may reach my parents at their
places of business."
684,FERRIS' VOICE,684,"I appreciate your conern for my
well-being. It will be remembered
long after..."
685,FERRIS,685,Have a nice day.
686,CAMERON,686,"How does she do that? One goes
one way, one goes the other."
687,FERRIS,687,She's probably schizophrenic.
688,SLOANE,688,"Ferris, this is nauseating me.
Really. I'm losing respect for
you by the bucket."
689,FERRIS,689,"You don't think it's amazing that
we got in?"
690,SLOANE,690,Who wants to get in?
691,FERRIS,691,"Cameron looks like a toddler, for
Christ's sake. I'm talking about
a major achievement in false
identification."
692,SLOANE,692,"I'm not interested in watching
someone jiggle their mammary glands."
693,FERRIS,693,"Point well taken. But consider why
she does it. Why she does it and
you don't."
694,SLOANE,694,I'm not a tramp.
695,FERRIS,695,"Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she
lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend.
A parent. A child..."
696,FERRIS,696,"This kind of thing makes me a little
depressed. You may think because I'm
the age I am that I'm a sex maniac.
That sex is all I think about.
But that's not true. I'm a romantic.
I think alot of people my age are.
We think about love and matters of
the heart. And SAT scores and acne
aside, we worry about lonliness. It's
a terrible thing. And we feel it. I
feel it."
697,FERRIS,697,"You know, someone said the world's a
stage and each must play a part.
Fate had me playing in love, with you
as my sweetheart. Act one was when we
met. I loved you at first glance. You
read your lines so cleverly and never
missed a cue. Then came act two. You
seemed to change. You acted strange.
And why, I've never known."
698,FERRIS,698,"Honey, you lies when you said you
loved me and I had no cause to
doubt you. But I'd rather go on
hearing your lies than to go on
living without you. Now, the stage
is bare and I'm standing there with
emptiness all around and if you won't
come back to me, then they can bring
the curtain down..."
699,ELVIS,699,"IS YOUR HEART FILLED WITH PAIN?
SHALL I COME BACK AGAIN?
TELL ME DEAR, ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT?"
700,ATTENDANT,700,"You looking for something in my
car?"
701,CAMERON'S FATHER,701,No.
702,JEANIE,702,I'm gonna microwave his nuts...
703,FERRIS,703,So...
704,FERRIS,704,"So, Yuri, how long have you been
in America?"
705,DRIVER,705,One year.
706,FERRIS,706,What's your overall impression?
707,DRIVER,707,It's very good here.
708,FERRIS,708,Better than Russia?
709,DRIVER,709,Much better here than in Russia.
710,FERRIS,710,"Clearly you've never been to an
American high school."
711,CAMERON,711,"It's getting late, Ferris. I have
to get the car home. I know you
don't care, but it means my ass."
712,FERRIS,712,You think I don't care?
713,CAMERON,713,I know you don't care.
714,FERRIS,714,"That hurts, Cameron."
715,SLOANE,715,"Jump back, Ferris, Cameron's been
a good sport."
716,FERRIS,716,"Cameron, what'd you see today?"
717,FERRIS,717,"You saw four states, a submarine,
a giant heart, seventy five dollars
worth of cooked pancreas, two of the
most incredible breasts ever to come
out of modern plastics, major
league baseball and..."
718,FERRIS,718,Are you gonna chuck your nachos?
719,FERRIS,719,What's he doing?
720,SLOANE,720,"He's looking at me and he's licking
the glass and making obscene gestures
with his hands."
721,FERRIS,721,What?!
722,SLOANE,722,Roast!
723,ROONEY,723,"That's a $28.00 dress shoe, you
worthless mutt!"
724,CAMERON,724,Money...tits...please...
725,DELIVERY MAN,725,Howdy!
726,FERRIS' VOICE,726,Who is it?
727,DELIVERY MAN,727,Focus on Flowers. I have a delivery.
728,FERRIS' VOICE,728,"I'm sorry but I can't come to the
door right now. I'm very ill and I'm
afraid...
ROONEY                              FERRIS' VOICE"
729,FERRIS' VOICE,729,"condition, I could take a
DELIVERY MAN            nasty spill and subject"
730,FERRIS' VOICE,730,"absenses...
ROONEY                        (pause)"
731,FERRIS' VOICE,731,"at their places of
DELIVERY MAN            business. Thank you for"
732,FERRIS' VOICE,732,"your concern for my well-
ROONEY                  being. It will be"
733,FERRIS' VOICE,733,this illness has passed.
734,DELIVERY MAN,734,"As I heard it from our mailman
he was supposedly born with only
half a kidney."
735,FERRIS' VOICE,735,Have a nice day.
736,DELIVERY MAN,736,Thank you.
737,DELIVERY MAN,737,"I don't know the details. But my
boss had to send to Milwaukee to
get more orchids. He's very
popular."
738,DELIVERY MAN,738,Nobody's home here?
739,ROONEY,739,No.
740,DELIVERY MAN,740,You gonna be around for awhile?
741,ROONEY,741,I imagine so.
742,DELIVERY MAN,742,You wanna keep an eye on these?
743,DELIVERY MAN,743,"It really touches me that so many people
are rallying behind this guy. I guess
there's hope for the human race afterall."
744,DELIVERY MAN,744,Gotta run.
745,ROONEY,745,"Oh, Christ..."
746,ROONEY,746,"ALL OUR BEST FOR A SPEEDY RECOVERY
THE ENGLISH DEPT. FACULTY AND STAFF"
747,D.J.,747,"I don't know who that was or
what they were playing but I
apologize for it nonetheless."
748,D.J.,748,I have a guest with me today...
749,D.J.,749,His name is Ferris Mueller.
750,FERRIS,750,Bueller. Ferris Bueller.
751,D.J.,751,Sorry about that.
752,FERRIS,752,It's cool.
753,D.J.,753,He has an incredible story.
754,FERRIS,754,"I'm going to tell a massive lie here.
It's going to by very thick and very
steamy. I think radio's a facinating
medium, it challenges the imagination.
Unlike television which provides the
images, radio..."
755,FERRIS,755,"You know this. Anyway, it's always been
a dream of mine to be on the radio.
I have what I consider to be an excellent
broadcast voice. I practise it in the
bathroom all the time. I used to play
records and do introductions to them.
But I've never had the chance to sit
behind a microphone and try it out
for real. This is a 50,000 watt outlet.
I'm going out to several million people
so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant
groove right now."
756,FERRIS,756,"Well, Steve, you and your listeners are
probably not going to believe this but..."
757,FERRIS' VOICE,757,"...I'm the first Chicago area youth
to be selected to participate in
a space shuttle mission."
758,FERRIS,758,"I was going to say I knew Springsteen's
home phone number and I was going
to give out the number of the New
Jersey State Police but I thought I
might get busted. After I got flunked
in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail
box, which was not in any way, shape
or from my fault. I was putting out a
cigarette, like I was told. It was weird.
I'm so used to getting in a car and
lighting up, because I'm not allowed to
smoke at home, that I got in the driver's
ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out
of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Heller
looked at me like I'd just pulled a bunny
out of my nose or something and I realized
what the hell I was doing and I went to
put it out and hit the mail box. Anyway,
I was so pissed off at her reaction to
the whole thing that I considered running
an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school
teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna
use Mrs. Heller's home number but is cost
too much. I took it again and passed. But
I had to work at Burger King to get the
cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. The
car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and
I think Rooney pocketed the cash. But I
can't prove it? I'm in high school, remember?"
759,D.J.,759,How did you get picked for this.
760,FERRIS,760,"It's kind of a long story but I've
been doing alot of programming for
NASA."
761,ROONEY,761,"Sleep tight, pooch."
762,JEANIE,762,I knew it!
763,JEANIE,763,"Is Mrs. Bueller there? Where is she?
This is her daughter. Do you know where
she is? Do you know when she'll be back?
Do you know anything?"
764,JEANIE,764,"The worm has luck like clams
have body odor..."
765,FERRIS' VOICE,765,"My input on the Star Wars defense
plan was pretty substantial so I
guess this is their way of rewarding
me. I'm pretty flattered."
766,D.J. VOICE,766,"Can you stay around and take a few
phone calls?"
767,FERRIS' VOICE,767,"I'd really like to but I have a kidney
operation in about an hour."
768,JOYCE,768,"If you're willing to commit a
little time and a little money
to this place, you can really
have something to be proud of.
Don't let the black living room
throw you off."
769,D.J. VOICE,769,I wish you the best of luck.
770,FERRIS' VOICE,770,"Thanks, Steve."
771,D.J. VOICE,771,"A very interesting guy, Ferris Bueller."
772,JOYCE,772,"Well, Boyd, how are you bearing
up?"
773,JOYCE,773,"Did I tell you I have a son
your age?"
774,BOYD,774,Twice.
775,JOYCE,775,"His name is Ferris. I think you'd
like him."
776,BOYD,776,"Is he going up in the space shuttle
in September?"
777,JOYCE,777,Not that I know of.
778,BOYD,778,I knew he was bullshitting.
779,MOTHER,779,Watch your mouth.
780,BOYD,780,How do you watch your mouth?
781,JOYCE,781,Do you know my son?
782,FATHER,782,"Don't pay any attention to him.
He thinks it's cute to bait adults."
783,BOYD,783,"I don't think it's cute. I think
it's fun."
784,JEANIE,784,"This is not a phoeny phone call. There's
an intruder, male caucasian, possibly armed,
certainly weird, in our kitchen."
785,JEANIE,785,My name is Bueller.
786,JEANIE,786,"It's real nice that you hope my
brother's feeling better but I'm
in danger, okay? I'm very cute,
I'm very alone and I'm very
protective of my body. I'd rather
not have it violated or killed.
I need help!"
787,JEANIE'S VOICE,787,"Excuse me. If whoever's in the house
is still in the house, I'd like you
to know that I have just called the police.
If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll
get your ass out of my house real quick."
788,JEANIE'S VOICE,788,"I'd also like to add that I have
my father's gun. And a scorching
case of herpes."
789,FERRIS,789,"Just out of curiosity, what was
your top speed coming down the
ramp?"
790,BLACK GUY,790,About 60.
791,FERRIS,791,Stunning!
792,FERRIS,792,"This is probably the last time you'll
have to ride back here. Keep that in
mind."
793,SLOANE,793,What's next.
794,CAMERON,794,Nothing. We return the car.
795,SLOANE,795,"We could go to my house. My parents
aren't coming home until late."
796,FERRIS,796,"We have enough cash left for a quick
flight to Peoria and back."
797,CAMERON,797,Very funny.
798,FERRIS,798,"Cameron? How many miles did you
say this thing had when we left?"
799,CAMERON,799,"One hundred and twenty six and
halfway between three and four
tenths. Why? How many miles are
on it now?"
800,FERRIS,800,Here's where Cameron goes berserk.
801,SLOANE,801,You okay?
802,FERRIS,802,"Hey, Cameron. It's okay. We'll fix
it."
803,SLOANE,803,"Cameron! Cut it out! What's
wrong?! Ferris!"
804,FERRIS,804,"Cameron, are you okay? It's
no problem, really. Your old
man won't know a thing. It's
completely fixable."
805,SLOANE,805,"Shut-up! It is a problem! For
him it's a problem. Nothing's
a problem for you. But it's
a problem for him! So, just
shut-up."
806,SLOANE,806,"What can I do, Cameron?"
807,FERRIS VOICE,807,Who is it?
808,VOICE,808,Anybody home?
809,FERRIS' VOICE,809,"I'm sorry that I can't come to
the door right now..."
810,JEANIE,810,"I'm saved! Thank you, God!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
811,JEANIE,811,Thank...you...
812,NURSE,812,"WE HOPE YOU'RE FEELING BETTER
WE HOPE YOU'RE FELLING FIT
WE..."
813,KID,813,"Hey, Mr. Rooney! What're you doing?"
814,ANOTHER KID,814,Did you get in a fight?
815,DRIVER,815,You want a lift?
816,GIRL,816,"I'll bet you never smelled a
real school bus before."
817,GIRL,817,Gummi Bear?
818,GIRL,818,"They've been in pocket. They're
real soft and warm."
819,FRESHMAN BOY,819,"It's kind of like being in the
belly of the beast isn't it?"
820,FERRIS,820,"This may very well be for real. I
think Cameron might have blown a
micro-chip or two. He's always been
a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do
was give him a good day. We're
gonna graduate in a couple of months.
Then we have the summer. He'll work
and I'll work. And we'll see each
other at night and on the weekends
but then he'll go to one school and I'll
go to another. And basically that'll
be it. As much as we like each other,
the process of growing up will
separate us."
821,FERRIS,821,"Sloane's a bigger problem. She still
has another year of high school. How
do I deal with that? I was serious when
I said I'd marry her. I would. This isn't
just teenage infatuation. That's what my
parents call it. What do they call what they
have? If that's love, I'll take infatuation."
822,FERRIS (VO),822,"Cameron's never been in love. At
least no one's ever been in love
with him. He's gonna marry the first
girl he lays. And she's gonna treat
him like shit because he's gonna
kiss her ass for giving him what he's
built-up in his mind as the end-all,
be-all of human existance. She won't
respect him because you can't respect
someone who kisses your ass. It just
doesn't work."
823,SLOANE,823,Ferris?
824,FERRIS,824,I'm being tested here.
825,FERRIS,825,"My best friend has flipped-out.
Conventional wisdom would suggest
a visit to the nearest trauma
center. I wouldn't fault anybody
for doing that. My, personally,
I think this calls for something
new, something bold, something wet
and wild."
826,FERRIS,826,"You feeling any better, Cameron?"
827,SLOANE,827,"The water's really nice. I wish
you'd come in."
828,CAMERON,828,Surgery...fire...move...
829,FERRIS,829,"Cameron? Do you think this because
of the car or is it a combination
of everything shitty in your life?"
830,CAMERON,830,Music...kiss...attack...
831,FERRIS,831,"You just can't deal with anymore
shit? The car took you into the
red zone? Time for a reality check?"
832,SLOANE,832,"Cameron? I could flip real easy, too.
There's nothing wrong with it. At one
time or another, everybody goes to
the zoo."
833,FERRIS,833,"Maybe he was actually sick. Maybe
he wasn't bullshitting himself."
834,CAMERON,834,Gesundheit...God...mercy...
835,FERRIS,835,CAMERON!
836,SLOANE,836,What?
837,FERRIS,837,You asshole!
838,SLOANE,838,What?
839,SLOANE,839,What's so funny?
840,BOY,840,Drugs?
841,JEANIE,841,"No, thank you. I'm straight."
842,BOY,842,"I meant, are you here for drugs?"
843,JEANIE,843,Why are you here?
844,BOY,844,Drugs.
845,JEANIE,845,I don't know why I'm here.
846,BOY,846,Then why don't you go home?
847,JEANIE,847,"Why don't you put your thumb
up your butt?"
848,BOY,848,You want to talk about your problem?
849,JEANIE,849,With you? Are you serious?
850,BOY,850,"Yeah, I'm serious."
851,JEANIE,851,Blow yourself.
852,JEANIE,852,You really want to know what's wrong?
853,JEANIE,853,"Alright. If you've got the time,
I've got the troubles. In a nutshell,
I hate my brother. How's that?"
854,BOY,854,"That's cool. Did you shoot him or
something?"
855,JEANIE,855,"No, not yet."
856,JEANIE,856,"I went home to confirm that the
shithead was ditching school and
a guy broke into the house and I
called the cops and they picked me
up for making a phoney phone call."
857,BOY,857,"What do you care if your brother
ditches school?"
858,JEANIE,858,"Why should he get to ditch school
when everybody else has to go?"
859,BOY,859,You could ditch.
860,JEANIE,860,I'd get caught.
861,BOY,861,"So, you're pissed at him because
he ditches and doesn't get caught?"
862,JEANIE,862,Basically.
863,BOY,863,Then your problem is you.
864,JEANIE,864,Excuse me?
865,BOY,865,"Excuse you. You oughta spend a little
more time dealing with yourself and
a little less time worrying about
what your brother does. It's just
an opinion."
866,BOY,866,"There's somebody you should talk
to."
867,JEANIE,867,"If you say Ferris Bueller, you lose
a testicle."
868,BOY,868,You know him?
869,CAMERON,869,"The whole time I was just thinking
things over. I was like, meditating.
I was thinking about the future.
And I realized it doesn't make
and difference if the present
goes to shit."
870,FERRIS,870,I have a agree with you there.
871,SLOANE,871,Really.
872,CAMERON,872,"I've been thinking all day that if
you could only have the use of one
word, what would it be?"
873,FERRIS,873,"Sloane is naked before your eyes and
you're thinking about words?"
874,SLOANE,874,"God bless you, Cameron."
875,CAMERON,875,"Thank you, Sloane."
876,CAMERON,876,"If you guys only had one word, what
would it be?"
877,FERRIS,877,"I can't believe you'd think up something
like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi
right in front of you."
878,SLOANE,878,"Come on, Ferris, answer his question."
879,FERRIS,879,Bathroom.
880,SLOANE,880,I'd say...
881,FERRIS,881,Cash.
882,CAMERON,882,"It's the only word you could
ever use."
883,FERRIS,883,Hello.
884,SLOANE,884,Love.
885,FERRIS,885,"And what is you loathe somebody?
Are you going to say ""love"" every
time you see them?"
886,SLOANE,886,"It's better than ""hello""."
887,FERRIS,887,Hellos' generic.
888,SLOANE,888,You wanna be generic?
889,CAMERON,889,It's help.
890,CAMERON,890,The word is help.
891,CAMERON,891,Ferris? It's not working.
892,CAMERON,892,"The miles aren't coming off, running
it in reverse."
893,FERRIS,893,"I thought that might be a problem.
Let's crack open the odometer and
roll it back by hand."
894,CAMERON,894,I got a better idea. It's cool.
895,CAMERON,895,"Seventeen years and I've never
taken a stand. Now, I'm gonna
do it. I'm taking a stand against
my father, against my family,
against myself, against my past,
my present and my future. I will
not sit idly by as events that affect
me unfold to change the course of
my life. I will take a stand and I
will defend it. When my father comes
home tonight, he's finally going
to have to deal with me. Good or
bad, I'm taking a stand."
896,FERRIS,896,This is a big U-2 fan.
897,FERRIS,897,What was that about?
898,SLOANE,898,This has to be a dream.
899,FERRIS,899,"Cameron? One quick question.
Why'd you do that?"
900,FERRIS,900,You trashed the car.
901,SLOANE,901,Why?
902,CAMERON,902,I took a stand.
903,FERRIS,903,"No, Cameron. You wrecked a car."
904,CAMERON,904,It's okay.
905,FERRIS,905,I have an idea. If you're interested.
906,CAMERON,906,I'm gonna handle it.
907,FERRIS,907,I think this could work.
908,CAMERON,908,"No, thanks. I want to deal with
it by myself."
909,SLOANE,909,What about your one word?
910,CAMERON,910,"You already did it. If I need it
again, I'll use it."
911,CAMERON,911,It's cool. I'm loose.
912,JOYCE,912,"She's never been in trouble before.
This is a shock to me. First, I
don't know why she wasn't at school.
Second, I don't know why she'd call
you with this story about a rapist."
913,OFFICER,913,"For whatever reasons she did it,
I think she'd had a good scare."
914,JOYCE,914,"I hope so. I appreciate your calling
me. I can assure you that her father
and I will have a long talk with her."
915,JOYCE,915,Thank you.
916,OFFICER,916,"Oh, by the way, I hope you son's
feeling better."
917,OFFICER,917,"Tell him, all the guys at the
station here are pulling for
him."
918,JEANIE,918,"If you keep this to yourself, I
think we can probably get it on
pretty good."
919,BOY,919,For sure.
920,JEANIE,920,Hi.
921,JOYCE,921,"Don't ""hi"" me, young lady. Get
your stuff."
922,BOY,922,What's your name?
923,JEANIE,923,Jean. What's yours?
924,BOY,924,Garth Volbeck.
925,SLOANE,925,I had a great time today.
926,FERRIS,926,Yeah. It was pretty cool.
927,SLOANE,927,"You think Cameron's gonna be
alright?"
928,FERRIS,928,"Sure. He had to so it, I guess.
His old man had it coming. He'll
be okay. I'd be worried if he'd
taken my idea."
929,SLOANE,929,"You didn't have an idea, did you?"
930,FERRIS,930,Not a glimmer.
931,SLOANE,931,You're so smart.
932,FERRIS,932,No. I'm just real loose.
933,FERRIS,933,I'll call you tonight.
934,SLOANE,934,I LOVE YOU!
935,SLOANE,935,He's gonna marry me. I know it.
936,SLOANE,936,"""...in the amount of $1,765.33. It
gives us great pleasure to assist
you in performance of your worthy
and much needed survives to those
so desperately in need."
937,ROONEY,937,Looking for this?
938,FERRIS,938,Yes.
939,ROONEY,939,"I got you, Ferris. This time I finally
got you."
940,ROONEY,940,"How does another year of high
school sit with you?"
941,JEANIE,941,"Thank God, you're alright! We've
been worried sick!"
942,JEANIE,942,"Thank you for bringing him home,
Mr. Rooney."
943,JEANIE,943,"You better get up in bed tight
now."
944,JEANIE,944,"Can you imagine someone as sick as
Ferris trying to walk home from the
hospital?"
945,JEANIE,945,Kids!
946,TODD,946,"Ferris?  Does my head look like
it's getting bigger?"
947,FERRIS,947,"No, but Kimberly's is."
948,KIMBERLY,948,Is he serious?
949,TODD,949,I think so.
950,KIMBERLY,950,"Oh, shit!"
951,FERRIS,951,"Thanks, Jeanie."
952,JEANIE,952,No problem.
953,FERRIS,953,"By the way, I borrowed some cash
from you. I'll pay you back."
954,JEANIE,954,You don't have to.
955,FERRIS,955,I want to.
956,JEANIE,956,"You don't have to. I've been ripping
off your wallet for years."
957,JOYCE,957,"Hi, guys."
958,KIMBERLY,958,Is my head swelling up?
959,JEANIE,959,"I'm sorry I've been riding your
buns for so long."
960,FERRIS,960,It's completely cool.
961,JOYCE (OC),961,Ferris!
962,FERRIS,962,"Upstairs, Mom!"
963,JEANIE,963,"Do you know a guy named Garth
Volbeck?"
964,FERRIS,964,Vaguely.
965,JEANIE,965,Is he cool?
966,FERRIS,966,"He's cool. But stay away from his
brother."
967,JOYCE,967,Honey?
968,TOM (OC),968,Ferris? How do you feel?
969,FERRIS,969,"150% better, thank you."
970,FERRIS,970,"I'm much better, really. Please,
don't make me stay home again. I
want to go to school. I'm graduating
in June and I..."
971,TOM,971,"Ferris. You're sick. There's no point
pushing yourself and making it worse."
972,FERRIS,972,"Maybe you're right, Dad."
973,TOM,973,I know I'm right.
974,JOYCE,974,How did you get so sweet?
975,FERRIS,975,Years of practice.
976,FERRIS,976,"Yeah, life is a carousel. A
great big crazy ball of pure
living, breathing joy and delight."
977,FERRIS,977,You gotta get one.
