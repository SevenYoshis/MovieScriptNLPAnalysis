0,YOUNG MAN,0,"No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm
through doin' that shit."
1,YOUNG WOMAN,1,"You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I'm through,
too dangerous."
2,YOUNG MAN,2,"I know that's what I always say. I'm
always right too, but "
3,YOUNG WOMAN,3," but you forget about it in a day
or two -"
4,YOUNG MAN,4," yeah, well, the days of me
forgittin' are over, and the days of
me rememberin' have just begun."
5,YOUNG WOMAN,5,"When you go on like this, you know
what you sound like?"
6,YOUNG MAN,6,"I sound like a sensible fucking man,
is what I sound like."
7,YOUNG WOMAN,7,You sound like a duck.
8,YOUNG WOMAN,8,"Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack..."
9,YOUNG MAN,9,"Well take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna hafta hear it again. Because
since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna hafta hear me
quack about how I'm never gonna do
it again."
10,YOUNG WOMAN,10,After tonight.
11,YOUNG MAN,11,Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
12,WAITRESS,12,Can I get anybody anymore coffee?
13,YOUNG WOMAN,13,"Oh yes, thank you."
14,YOUNG MAN,14,I'm doin' fine.
15,YOUNG MAN,15,"I mean the way it is now, you're
takin' the same fuckin' risk as when
you rob a bank. You take more of a
risk. Banks are easier!  Federal
banks aren't supposed to stop you
anyway, during a robbery. They're
insured, why should they care? You
don't even need a gun in a federal
bank. I heard about this guy, walked
into a federal bank with a portable
phone, handed the phone to the teller,
the guy on the other end of the phone
said: ""We got this guy's little girl,
and if you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill 'er."""
16,YOUNG WOMAN,16,Did it work?
17,YOUNG MAN,17,"Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm
talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in
a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,
not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,
cleans the place out, and they don't
lift a fuckin' finger."
18,YOUNG WOMAN,18,Did they hurt the little girl?
19,YOUNG MAN,19,"I don't know. There probably never
was a little girl  the point of the
story isn't the little girl. The
point of the story is they robbed
the bank with a telephone."
20,YOUNG WOMAN,20,You wanna rob banks?
21,YOUNG MAN,21,"I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,
I'm just illustrating that if we
did, it would be easier than what we
been doin'."
22,YOUNG WOMAN,22,So you don't want to be a bank robber?
23,YOUNG MAN,23,"Naw, all those guys are goin' down
the same road, either dead or servin'
twenty."
24,YOUNG WOMAN,24,And no more liquor stores?
25,YOUNG MAN,25,"What have we been talking about?
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,
it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too
many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't
fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:
""Empty out the register,"" and they
don't know what it fuckin' means.
They make it too personal. We keep
on, one of those gook motherfuckers'
gonna make us kill 'em."
26,YOUNG WOMAN,26,I'm not gonna kill anybody.
27,YOUNG MAN,27,"I don't wanna kill anybody either.
But they'll probably put us in a
situation where it's us of them. And
if it's not the gooks, it these old
Jews who've owned the store for
fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got
Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the
counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try
walkin' into one of those stores
with nothin' but a telephone, see
how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget
it, we're out of it."
28,YOUNG WOMAN,28,"Well, what else is there, day jobs?"
29,YOUNG MAN,29,Not this life.
30,YOUNG WOMAN,30,Well what then?
31,YOUNG MAN,31,Garcon! Coffee!
32,YOUNG MAN,32,This place.
33,WAITRESS,33,"""Garcon"" means boy."
34,YOUNG WOMAN,34,Here? It's a coffee shop.
35,YOUNG MAN,35,"What's wrong with that? People never
rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor
stores, gas stations, you get your
head blown off stickin' up one of
them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expecting to get robbed,
or not as expecting."
36,YOUNG WOMAN,36,"I bet in places like this you could
cut down on the hero factor."
37,YOUNG MAN,37,"Correct. Just like banks, these places
are insured. The managers don't give
a fuck, they're just tryin' to get
ya out the door before you start
pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget
it, they ain't takin' a bullet for
the register. Busboys, some wetback
gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour
gonna really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner. Customers
are sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin'
on. One minute they're havin' a Denver
omelet, next minute somebody's
stickin' a gun in their face."
38,YOUNG MAN,38,"See, I got the idea last liquor store
we stuck up. 'Member all those
customers kept comin' in?"
39,YOUNG WOMAN,39,Yeah.
40,YOUNG MAN,40,"Then you got the idea to take
everybody's wallet."
41,YOUNG WOMAN,41,Uh-huh.
42,YOUNG MAN,42,That was a good idea.
43,YOUNG WOMAN,43,Thanks.
44,YOUNG MAN,44,"We made more from the wallets then
we did the register."
45,YOUNG WOMAN,45,Yes we did.
46,YOUNG MAN,46,A lot of people go to restaurants.
47,YOUNG WOMAN,47,A lot of wallets.
48,YOUNG MAN,48,"Pretty smart, huh?"
49,YOUNG WOMAN,49,Pretty smart.
50,YOUNG WOMAN,50,"I'm ready, let's go, right here,
right now."
51,YOUNG MAN,51,"Remember, same as before, you're
crowd control, I handle the employees."
52,YOUNG WOMAN,52,Got it.
53,YOUNG WOMAN,53,"I love you, Pumpkin."
54,YOUNG MAN,54,"I love you, Honey Bunny."
55,PUMPKIN,55,Everybody be cool this is a robbery!
56,HONEY BUNNY,56,"Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?"
57,JULES,57," Okay now, tell me about the hash
bars?"
58,VINCENT,58,What so you want to know?
59,JULES,59,"Well, hash is legal there, right?"
60,VINCENT,60,"Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
hundred percent legal. I mean you
can't walk into a restaurant, roll a
joint, and start puffin' away. You're
only supposed to smoke in your home
or certain designated places."
61,JULES,61,Those are hash bars?
62,VINCENT,62,"Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's
legal to buy it, it's legal to own
it and, if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't
really matter 'cause  get a load of
this  if the cops stop you, it's
illegal for this to search you.
Searching you is a right that the
cops in Amsterdam don't have."
63,JULES,63,"That did it, man  I'm fuckin' goin',
that's all there is to it."
64,VINCENT,64,"You'll dig it the most. But you know
what the funniest thing about Europe
is?"
65,JULES,65,What?
66,VINCENT,66,"It's the little differences. A lotta
the same shit we got here, they got
there, but there they're a little
different."
67,JULES,67,Examples?
68,VINCENT,68,"Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer
in a movie theatre. And I don't mean
in a paper cup either. They give you
a glass of beer, like in a bar. In
Paris, you can buy beer at
MacDonald's. Also, you know what
they call a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese in Paris?"
69,JULES,69,"They don't call it a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese?"
70,VINCENT,70,"No, they got the metric system there,
they wouldn't know what the fuck a
Quarter Pounder is."
71,JULES,71,What'd they call it?
72,VINCENT,72,Royale with Cheese.
73,JULES,73,"Royale with Cheese. What'd they call
a Big Mac?"
74,VINCENT,74,"Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
it Le Big Mac."
75,JULES,75,"Le Big Mac. What do they call a
Whopper?"
76,VINCENT,76,"I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
King.  But you know what they put on
french fries in Holland instead of
ketchup?"
77,JULES,77,What?
78,VINCENT,78,Mayonnaise.
79,JULES,79,Goddamn!
80,VINCENT,80,"I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a
little bit on the side of the plate,
they fuckin' drown 'em in it."
81,JULES,81,Uuccch!
82,JULES,82,"We should have shotguns for this
kind of deal."
83,VINCENT,83,How many up there?
84,JULES,84,Three or four.
85,VINCENT,85,Counting our guy?
86,JULES,86,I'm not sure.
87,VINCENT,87,So there could be five guys up there?
88,JULES,88,It's possible.
89,VINCENT,89,We should have fuckin' shotguns.
90,VINCENT,90,What's her name?
91,JULES,91,Mia.
92,VINCENT,92,How did Marsellus and her meet?
93,JULES,93,"I dunno, however people meet people.
She usta be an actress."
94,VINCENT,94,She ever do anything I woulda saw?
95,JULES,95,"I think her biggest deal was she
starred in a pilot."
96,VINCENT,96,What's a pilot?
97,JULES,97,"Well, you know the shows on TV?"
98,VINCENT,98,I don't watch TV.
99,JULES,99,"Yes, but you're aware that there's
an invention called television, and
on that invention they show shows?"
100,VINCENT,100,Yeah.
101,JULES,101,"Well, the way they pick the shows on
TV is they make one show, and that
show's called a pilot. And they show
that one show to the people who pick
the shows, and on the strength of
that one show, they decide if they
want to make more shows. Some get
accepted and become TV programs, and
some don't, and become nothing. She
starred in one of the ones that became
nothing."
102,JULES,102,"You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
black, half-Samoan, usta call him
Tony Rocky Horror."
103,VINCENT,103,"Yeah maybe, fat right?"
104,JULES,104,"I wouldn't go so far as to call the
brother fat. He's got a weight
problem.  What's the nigger gonna
do, he's Samoan."
105,VINCENT,105,"I think I know who you mean, what
about him?"
106,JULES,106,"Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up
good.  And word around the campfire,
it was on account of Marsellus
Wallace's wife."
107,VINCENT,107,"What'd he do, fuck her?"
108,JULES,108,"No no no no no no no, nothin' that
bad."
109,VINCENT,109,Well what then?
110,JULES,110,He gave her a foot massage.
111,VINCENT,111,A foot massage?
112,VINCENT,112,That's all?
113,VINCENT,113,What did Marsellus do?
114,JULES,114,"Sent a couple of guys over to his
place.  They took him out on the
patio of his apartment, threw his
ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell
four stories. They had this garden
at the bottom, enclosed in glass,
like one of them greenhouses  nigger
fell through that. Since then, he's
kinda developed a speech impediment."
115,VINCENT,115,That's a damn shame.
116,VINCENT,116,"Still I hafta say, play with matches,
ya get burned."
117,JULES,117,Whaddya mean?
118,VINCENT,118,"You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage."
119,JULES,119,You don't think he overreacted?
120,VINCENT,120,"Antwan probably didn't expect
Marsellus to react like he did, but
he had to expect a reaction."
121,JULES,121,"It was a foot massage, a foot massage
is nothing, I give my mother a foot
massage."
122,VINCENT,122,"It's laying hands on Marsellus
Wallace's new wife in a familiar
way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out
 no, but you're in the same fuckin'
ballpark."
123,JULES,123,"Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right
there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'
a bitch a foot massage ain't even
the same fuckin' thing."
124,VINCENT,124,"Not the same thing, the same ballpark."
125,JULES,125,"It ain't no ballpark either. Look
maybe your method of massage differs
from mine, but touchin' his lady's
feet, and stickin' your tongue in
her holyiest of holyies, ain't the
same ballpark, ain't the same league,
ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
Foot massages don't mean shit."
126,VINCENT,126,Have you ever given a foot massage?
127,JULES,127,"Don't be tellin' me about foot
massages  I'm the foot fuckin'
master."
128,VINCENT,128,Given a lot of 'em?
129,JULES,129,"Shit yeah. I got my technique down
man, I don't tickle or nothin'."
130,VINCENT,130,"Have you ever given a guy a foot
massage?"
131,JULES,131,Fuck you.
132,VINCENT,132,How many?
133,JULES,133,Fuck you.
134,VINCENT,134,"Would you give me a foot massage 
I'm kinda tired."
135,JULES,135,"Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'
pissed  this is the door."
136,JULES,136,What time is it?
137,VINCENT,137,Seven-twenty-two in the morning.
138,JULES,138,"It ain't quite time, let's hang back."
139,JULES,139,"Look, just because I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage, don't make it
right for Marsellus to throw Antwan
off a building into a glass-
motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the
way the nigger talks. That ain't
right, man. Motherfucker do that to
me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
I'd kill'a motherfucker."
140,VINCENT,140,"I'm not sayin' he was right, but
you're sayin' a foot massage don't
mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.
I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages and they all meant
somethin'. We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's so fuckin'
cool about 'em. This sensual thing's
goin' on that nobody's talkin about,
but you know it and she knows it,
fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
shoulda known fuckin' better. That's
his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna
have a sense of humor about that
shit."
141,JULES,141,"That's an interesting point, but
let's get into character."
142,VINCENT,142,What's her name again?
143,JULES,143,"Mia. Why you so interested in big
man's wife?"
144,VINCENT,144,"Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida
and when he's gone, he wants me to
take care of Mia."
145,JULES,145,Take care of her?
146,VINCENT,146,"Not that! Take her out. Show her a
good time. Don't let her get lonely."
147,JULES,147,"You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace
out on a date?"
148,VINCENT,148,"It ain't a date. It's like when you
and your buddy's wife go to a movie
or somethin'. It's just... you know...
good company."
149,VINCENT,149,It's not a date.
150,JULES,150,Hey kids.
151,JULES,151,How you boys doin'?
152,JULES,152,"Am I trippin', or did I just ask you
a question."
153,BRETT,153,We're doin' okay.
154,JULES,154,Do you know who we are?
155,JULES,155,"We're associates of your business
partner Marsellus Wallace, you
remember your business partner
dont'ya?"
156,JULES,156,"Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:
you're Brett, right?"
157,BRETT,157,I'm Brett.
158,JULES,158,"I thought so. Well, you remember
your business partner Marsellus
Wallace, dont'ya Brett?"
159,BRETT,159,I remember him.
160,JULES,160,"Good for you. Looks like me and
Vincent caught you at breakfast,
sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?"
161,BRETT,161,Hamburgers.
162,JULES,162,"Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any
nutritious breakfast. What kinda
hamburgers?"
163,BRETT,163,Cheeseburgers.
164,JULES,164,"No, I mean where did you get'em?
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
Box, where?"
165,BRETT,165,Big Kahuna Burger.
166,JULES,166,"Big Kahuna Burger. That's that
Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they
got some tasty burgers. I ain't never
had one myself, how are they?"
167,BRETT,167,They're good.
168,JULES,168,Mind if I try one of yours?
169,BRETT,169,No.
170,JULES,170,"Yours is this one, right?"
171,BRETT,171,Yeah.
172,JULES,172,"Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger."
173,JULES,173,"Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
Burger?"
174,VINCENT,174,No.
175,JULES,175,"You wanna bite, they're real good."
176,VINCENT,176,I ain't hungry.
177,JULES,177,"Well, if you like hamburgers give
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian. Which more or less
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure
love the taste of a good burger."
178,JULES,178,"You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?"
179,BRETT,179,No.
180,JULES,180,"Tell 'em, Vincent."
181,VINCENT,181,Royale with Cheese.
182,JULES,182,"Royale with Cheese, you know why
they call it that?"
183,BRETT,183,Because of the metric system?
184,JULES,184,"Check out the big brain on Brett.
You'a smart motherfucker, that's
right. The metric system."
185,JULES,185,What's in this?
186,BRETT,186,Sprite.
187,JULES,187,"Sprite, good, mind if I have some of
your tasty beverage to wash this
down with?"
188,BRETT,188,Sure.
189,JULES,189,"Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!"
190,JULES,190,"You, Flock of Seagulls, you know
what we're here for?"
191,JULES,191,"Then why don't you tell my boy here
Vince, where you got the shit hid."
192,MARVIN,192,It's under the be 
193,JULES,193," I don't remember askin' you a
goddamn thing."
194,JULES,194,You were sayin'?
195,ROGER,195,It's under the bed.
196,VINCENT,196,Got it.
197,JULES,197,We happy?
198,JULES,198,Vincent!
199,JULES,199,We happy?
200,VINCENT,200,We're happy.
201,BRETT,201,"Look, what's your name? I got his
name's Vincent, but what's yours?"
202,JULES,202,"My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'
your ass outta this shit."
203,BRETT,203,"I just want you to know how sorry we
are about how fucked up things got
between us and Mr. Wallace. When we
entered into this thing, we only had
the best intentions "
204,JULES,204,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your
concentration? I didn't mean to do
that.  Please, continue. I believe
you were saying something about ""best
intentions."""
205,JULES,205,"Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through
anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would
you describe for me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like?"
206,JULES,206,What country you from!
207,BRETT,207,What?
208,JULES,208,"""What"" ain't no country I know! Do
they speak English in ""What?"""
209,BRETT,209,What?
210,JULES,210,"English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
it?"
211,BRETT,211,Yes.
212,JULES,212,Then you understand what I'm sayin'?
213,BRETT,213,Yes.
214,JULES,214,"Now describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!"
215,BRETT,215,What?
216,JULES,216,"Say ""What"" again! C'mon, say ""What""
again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya
motherfucker, say ""What"" one more
goddamn time!"
217,JULES,217,"Now describe to me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like!"
218,BRETT,218,Well he's... he's... black 
219,JULES,219, go on!
220,BRETT,220,...and he's... he's... bald 
221,JULES,221, does he look like a bitch?!
222,BRETT,222,What?
223,JULES,223,Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!
224,BRETT,224,No.
225,JULES,225,"Then why did you try to fuck 'im
like a bitch?!"
226,BRETT,226,I didn't.
227,JULES,227,"Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck
'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?"
228,BRETT,228,Yes.
229,JULES,229,"There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness, for he is
truly his brother's keeper and the
finder of lost children. And I will
strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know my name
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
upon you."""
230,MARSELLUS (O.S.),230,"I think you're gonna find  when all
this shit is over and done  I think
you're gonna find yourself one smilin'
motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right
now you got ability. But painful as
it may be, ability don't last. Now
that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of
life, but it's a fact of life your
ass is gonna hafta git realistic
about. This business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic
motherfuckers who thought their ass
aged like wine.  Besides, even if
you went all the way, what would you
be? Feather-weight champion of the
world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you
can even get a credit card based on
that."
231,MARSELLUS (O.S.),231,"Now the night of the fight, you may
fell a slight sting, that's pride
fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride
only hurts, it never helps. Fight
through that shit. 'Cause a year
from now, when you're kickin' it in
the Caribbean you're gonna say,
""Marsellus Wallace was right."""
232,BUTCH,232,I got no problem with that.
233,MARSELLUS (O.S.),233,"In the fifth, your ass goes down."
234,MARSELLUS (O.S.),234,Say it!
235,BUTCH,235,"In the fifth, my ass goes down."
236,ENGLISH DAVE,236,"Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,
git your ass on in here."
237,VINCENT,237,Where's the big man?
238,ENGLISH DAVE,238,"He's over there, finishing up some
business."
239,ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.),239,"Hang back for a second or two, and
when you see the white boy leave, go
on over.  In the meanwhile, can I
make you an espresso?"
240,VINCENT,240,"How 'bout a cup of just plain lo'
American?"
241,ENGLISH DAVE,241,"Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia
out tomorrow?"
242,VINCENT,242,At Marsellus' request.
243,ENGLISH DAVE,243,Have you met Mia?
244,VINCENT,244,Not yet.
245,VINCENT,245,What's so funny?
246,ENGLISH DAVE,246,Not a goddamn thing.
247,VINCENT,247,"Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big
man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit
across a table, chew my food with my
mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and
that's all I'm gonna do."
248,ENGLISH DAVE,248,"My name's Paul, and this is between
y'all."
249,BUTCH,249,Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?
250,ENGLISH DAVE,250,Filters?
251,BUTCH,251,Non.
252,BUTCH,252,"Lookin' at somethin', friend?"
253,VINCENT,253,"I ain't your friend, palooka."
254,BUTCH,254,What was that?
255,VINCENT,255,"I think ya heard me just fine, punchy."
256,MARSELLUS (O.S.),256,"Vincent Vega has entered the building,
git your ass over here!"
257,ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.),257,"Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty."
258,JODY,258,"...I'll lend it to you. It's a great
book on body piercing."
259,TRUDI,259,"You know how they use that gun when
they pierce your ears? They don't
use that when they pierce your
nipples, do they?"
260,JODY,260,"Forget that gun. That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing. All
of my piercing, sixteen places on my
body, every one of 'em done with a
needle. Five in each ear. One through
the nipple on my left breast. One
through my right nostril.  One through
my left eyebrow. One through my lip.
One in my clit. And I wear a stud in
my tongue."
261,VINCENT,261,"Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm
curious, why would you get a stud in
your tongue?"
262,JODY,262,It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.
263,LANCE (O.S.),263,"Vince, you can come in now!"
264,LANCE,264,"Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very
good stuff. This is Bava, different,
but equally good. And this is Choco
from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
Now the first two are the same, forty-
five an ounce  those are friend
prices  but this one..."
265,LANCE,265,"...this one's a little more expensive.
It's fifty-five. But when you shoot
it, you'll know where that extra
money went.  Nothing wrong with the
first two. It's real, real, real,
good shit. But this one's a fuckin'
madman."
266,VINCENT,266,"Remember, I just got back from
Amsterdam."
267,LANCE,267,"Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?
No.  You're in my house. White people
who know the difference between good
shit and bad shit, this is the house
they come to. My shit, I'll take the
Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit
any ol' day of the fuckin' week."
268,VINCENT,268,That's a bold statement.
269,LANCE,269,"This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is
a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'
dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole
seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,
they're as hot as hell."
270,VINCENT,270,"Give me three hundred worth of the
madman.  If it's as good as you say,
I'll be back for a thousand."
271,LANCE,271,"I just hope I still have it. Whaddya
think of Trudi? She ain't got a
boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get
high?"
272,VINCENT,272,"Which one's Trudi? The one with all
the shit in her face?"
273,LANCE,273,"No, that's Jody. That's my wife."
274,VINCENT,274,"I'm on my way somewhere. I got a
dinner engagement. Rain check?"
275,LANCE,275,No problem?
276,VINCENT,276,You don't mind if I shoot up here?
277,LANCE,277,"Me casa, su casa."
278,VINCENT,278,Mucho gracias.
279,LANCE,279,Still got your Malibu?
280,VINCENT,280,"You know what some fucker did to it
the other day?"
281,LANCE,281,What?
282,VINCENT,282,Fuckin' keyed it.
283,LANCE,283,"Oh man, that's fucked up."
284,VINCENT,284,"Tell me about it. I had the goddamn
thing in storage three years. It's
out five fuckin' days  five days,
and some dickless piece of shit fucks
with it."
285,LANCE,285,"They should be fuckin' killed. No
trial, no jury, straight to execution."
286,VINCENT,286,"I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,
ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything
to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been
worth his doin' it, if I coulda just
caught 'em, you know what I mean?"
287,LANCE,287,"It's chicken shit. You don't fuck
another man's vehicle."
288,MIA (V.O.),288,"Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.
The door's open. Come inside and
make yourself a drink."
289,VINCENT,289,Hello?
290,MIA,290,Vincent.
291,MIA,291,Vincent. I'm on the intercom.
292,MIA,292,"It's on the wall by the two African
fellas."
293,MIA,293,To your right.
294,MIA,294,...warm. Warmer. Disco.
295,VINCENT,295,Hello.
296,MIA,296,Push the button if you want to talk.
297,VINCENT,297,Hello.
298,MIA,298,"Go make yourself a drink., and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's
tail."
299,MIA,299,The bar's by the fireplace.
300,VINCENT,300,Okay.
301,MIA,301,Let's go.
302,VINCENT,302,What the fuck is this place?
303,MIA,303,"This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis
man should love it."
304,VINCENT,304,"Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak."
305,MIA,305,"You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Don't be a..."
306,VINCENT,306,"After you, kitty-cat."
307,BUDDY,307,"Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?"
308,VINCENT,308,I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
309,BUDDY,309,"How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?"
310,VINCENT,310,"Bloody as hell. And to drink, a
vanilla coke."
311,BUDDY,311,"How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?"
312,MIA,312,"I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger 
bloody  and a five-dollar shake."
313,BUDDY,313,"How d'ya want that shake, Martin and
Lewis, or Amos and Andy?"
314,MIA,314,Martin and Lewis.
315,VINCENT,315,"Did you just order a five-dollar
shake?"
316,MIA,316,Sure did.
317,VINCENT,317,A shake? Milk and ice cream?
318,MIA,318,Uh-huh.
319,VINCENT,319,It costs five dollars?
320,BUDDY,320,Yep.
321,VINCENT,321,"You don't put bourbon in it or
anything?"
322,BUDDY,322,Nope.
323,VINCENT,323,Just checking.
324,MIA,324,Whaddya think?
325,VINCENT,325,"It's like a wax museum with a pulse
rate."
326,MIA,326,What are you doing?
327,VINCENT,327,Rollin' a smoke.
328,MIA,328,Here?
329,VINCENT,329,It's just tobacco.
330,MIA,330,"Oh. Well in that case, will you roll
me one, cowboy?"
331,VINCENT,331,"You can have this one, cowgirl."
332,MIA,332,Thanks.
333,VINCENT,333,Think nothing of it.
334,MIA,334,"Marsellus said you just got back
from Amsterdam."
335,VINCENT,335,Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.
336,MIA,336,That was my fifteen minutes.
337,VINCENT,337,What was it?
338,MIA,338,"It was show about a team of female
secret agents called ""Fox Force Five."""
339,VINCENT,339,What?
340,MIA,340,"""Fox Force Five."" Fox, as in we're a
bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in
we're a force to be reckoned with.
Five, as in there's one... two ...
three... four... five of us. There
was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal
from that show ""Baton Rouge,"" she
was the leader. A Japanese one, a
black one, a French one and a brunette
one, me.  We all had special skills.
Sommerset had a photographic memory,
the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,
the black girl was a demolition
expert, the French fox' specialty
was sex..."
341,VINCENT,341,What was your specialty?
342,MIA,342,"Knives. The character I played, Raven
McCoy, her background was she was
raised by circus performers. So she
grew up doing a knife act. According
to the show, she was the deadliest
woman in the world with a knife. But
because she grew up in a circus, she
was also something of an acrobat.
She could do illusions, she was a
trapeze artist  when you're keeping
the world safe from evil, you never
know when being a trapeze artist's
gonna come in handy. And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her. If
we woulda got picked up, they woulda
worked in a gimmick where every
episode I woulda told and ol joke."
343,VINCENT,343,Do you remember any of the jokes?
344,MIA,344,"Well I only got the chance to say
one, 'cause we only did one show."
345,VINCENT,345,Tell me.
346,MIA,346,No. It's really corny.
347,VINCENT,347,"C'mon, don't be that way."
348,MIA,348,"No. You won't like it and I'll be
embarrassed."
349,VINCENT,349,"You told it in front of fifty million
people and you can't tell it to me?
I promise I won't laugh."
350,MIA,350,That's what I'm afraid of.
351,VINCENT,351,"That's not what I meant and you know
it."
352,MIA,352,"You're quite the silver tongue devil,
aren't you?"
353,VINCENT,353,I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.
354,MIA,354,"That's not what you said Vince. Well
now I'm definitely not gonna tell
ya, 'cause it's been built up too
much."
355,VINCENT,355,What a gyp.
356,MIA,356,Yummy!
357,VINCENT,357,"Can I have a sip of that? I'd like
to know what a five-dollar shake
tastes like."
358,MIA,358,Be my guest.
359,MIA,359,"You can use my straw, I don't have
kooties."
360,VINCENT,360,"Yeah, but maybe I do."
361,MIA,361,Kooties I can handle.
362,VINCENT,362,"Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'
good milk shake."
363,MIA,363,Told ya.
364,VINCENT,364,"I don't know if it's worth five
dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'
good."
365,MIA,365,Don't you hate that?
366,VINCENT,366,What?
367,MIA,367,"Uncomfortable silences. Why do we
feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?"
368,VINCENT,368,I don't know.
369,MIA,369,"That's when you know you found
somebody special. When you can just
shit the fuck up for a minute, and
comfortably share silence."
370,VINCENT,370,"I don't think we're there yet. But
don't feel bad, we just met each
other."
371,MIA,371,"Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to
the bathroom and powder my nose,
while you sit here and think of
something to say."
372,VINCENT,372,I'll do that.
373,MIA,373,I said goddamn!
374,MIA,374,"Don't you love it when you go to the
bathroom and you come back to find
your food waiting for you?"
375,VINCENT,375,"We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy
Holly doesn't seem to be much of a
waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn
Monroe's section."
376,MIA,376,"Which one, there's two Marilyn
Monroes."
377,VINCENT,377,No there's not.
378,VINCENT,378,That's Marilyn Monroe...
379,VINCENT,379,"... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I
don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it
must be her night off."
380,MIA,380,Pretty smart.
381,VINCENT,381,I have moments.
382,MIA,382,Did ya think of something to say?
383,VINCENT,383,"Actually, there's something I've
wanted to ask you about, but you
seem like a nice person, and I didn't
want to offend you."
384,MIA,384,"Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like
mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
you chit-chat. This sounds like you
actually have something to say."
385,VINCENT,385,"Only if you promise not to get
offended."
386,MIA,386,"You can't promise something like
that. I have no idea what you're
gonna ask. You could ask me what
you're gonna ask me, and my natural
response could be to be offended.
Then, through no fault of my own, I
woulda broken my promise."
387,VINCENT,387,Then let's just forget it.
388,MIA,388,"That is an impossibility. Trying to
forget anything as intriguing as
this would be an exercise in futility."
389,VINCENT,389,Is that a fact?
390,MIA,390,"Besides, it's more exciting when you
don't have permission."
391,VINCENT,391,"What do you think about what happened
to Antwan?"
392,MIA,392,Who's Antwan?
393,VINCENT,393,Tony Rocky Horror.
394,MIA,394,He fell out of a window.
395,VINCENT,395,"That's one way to say it. Another
way is, he was thrown out. Another
was is, he was thrown out by
Marsellus. And even another way is,
he was thrown out of a window by
Marsellus because of you."
396,MIA,396,Is that a fact?
397,VINCENT,397,"No it's not, it's just what I heard."
398,MIA,398,Who told you this?
399,VINCENT,399,They.
400,MIA,400,"They talk a lot, don't they?"
401,VINCENT,401,They certainly do.
402,MIA,402,"Well don't by shy Vincent, what
exactly did they say?"
403,MIA,403,"Let me help you Bashful, did it
involve the F-word?"
404,VINCENT,404,"No. They just said Rocky Horror gave
you a foot massage."
405,MIA,405,And...?
406,VINCENT,406,"No and, that's it."
407,MIA,407,"You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror
out of a four-story window because
he massaged my feet?"
408,VINCENT,408,Yeah.
409,MIA,409,And you believed that?
410,VINCENT,410,"At the time I was told, it seemed
reasonable."
411,MIA,411,"Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
four story window for giving me a
foot massage seemed reasonable?"
412,VINCENT,412,"No, it seemed excessive. But that
doesn't mean it didn't happen. I
heard Marsellus is very protective
of you."
413,MIA,413,"A husband being protective of his
wife is one thing. A husband almost
killing another man for touching his
wife's feet is something else."
414,VINCENT,414,But did it happen?
415,MIA,415,"The only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand, when he shook
it. I met Anwan once  at my wedding
 then never again.  The truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus tossed
Tony Rocky Horror out of that window
except Marsellus and Tony Rocky
Horror. But when you scamps get
together, you're worse than a sewing
circle."
416,ED SULLIVAN,416,"Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the
worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist
contest."
417,ED SULLIVAN,417,"...One lucky couple will win this
handsome trophy that Marilyn here is
holding."
418,ED SULLIVAN,418,"...Now, who will be our first
contestants?"
419,MIA,419,Right here.
420,MIA,420,I wanna dance.
421,VINCENT,421,"No, no, no no, no, no, no, no."
422,MIA,422,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do
believe Marsellus, my husband, your
boss, told you to take me out and do
whatever I wanted, Now, I want to
dance. I want to win. I want that
trophy."
423,VINCENT,423,All right.
424,MIA,424,"So, dance good."
425,VINCENT,425,"All right, you asked for it."
426,ED SULLIVAN,426,"Let's hear it for our first
contestants."
427,ED SULLIVAN,427,"Now let's meet our first contestants
here this evening. Young lady, what
is your name?"
428,MIA,428,Missus Mia Wallace.
429,ED SULLIVAN,429,"And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?"
430,MIA,430,Vincent Vega.
431,ED SULLIVAN,431,"All right, let's see what you can
do. Take it away!"
432,VINCENT,432,Was than an uncomfortable silence?
433,MIA,433,I don't know what that was.
434,MIA,434,Music and drinks!
435,VINCENT,435,I'm gonna take a piss.
436,MIA,436,"That was a little bit more information
than I needed to know, but go right
ahead."
437,MIA,437,"Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,
you've been holding out on me."
438,VINCENT,438,"One drink and leave. Don't be rude,
but drink your drink quickly, say
goodbye, walk out the door, get in
your car, and go down the road."
439,VINCENT,439,"...It's a moral test of yourself,
whether or not you can maintain
loyalty. Because when people are
loyal to each other, that's very
meaningful."
440,VINCENT,440,"So you're gonna go out there, drink
your drink, say ""Goodnight, I've had
a very lovely evening,"" go home, and
jack off.  And that's all you're
gonna do."
441,VINCENT,441,Jesus Christ!
442,VINCENT,442,Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?
443,VINCENT,443,I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
444,VINCENT,444,"Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer
me honey, what did you take?"
445,VINCENT,445,"Okay honey, we're getting you on
your feet."
446,VINCENT,446,"We're on our feet now, and now we're
gonna talk out to the car. Here we
go, watch us walk."
447,PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS),447,"Hold hands, you love birds."
448,JODY (O.S.),448,Lance! The phone's ringing!
449,LANCE,449,I can hear it!
450,JODY (O.S.),450,"I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call this late!"
451,LANCE,451,"I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna
tell this fuckin' asshole right now!"
452,LANCE,452,"Hello, do you know how late it is?
You're not supposed to be callin' me
this fuckin' late."
453,VINCENT,453,"Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big
fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way
to your place."
454,LANCE,454,"Whoa, hold you horses man, what's
the problem?"
455,VINCENT,455,You still got an adrenaline shot?
456,LANCE,456,Maybe.
457,VINCENT,457,"I need it man, I got a chick she's
fuckin'  Doing on me."
458,LANCE,458,"Don't bring her here!  I'm not even
fuckin' joking with you, don't you
be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt
to my house!"
459,VINCENT,459,No choice.
460,LANCE,460,She's ODin'?
461,VINCENT,461,Yeah. She's dyin'.
462,LANCE,462,"Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take
'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!"
463,VINCENT,463,Negative.
464,LANCE,464,"She ain't my fuckin' problem, you
fucked her up, you deal with it 
are you talkin' to me on a cellular
phone?"
465,VINCENT,465,Sorry.
466,LANCE,466,"I don't know you, who is this, don't
come here, I'm hangin' up."
467,VINCENT,467,"Too late, I'm already here."
468,JODY (O.S.),468,What the hell was that?
469,LANCE,469,"Have you lost your mind?! You crashed
your car in my fuckin' house! You
talk about drug shit on a cellular
fuckin' phone "
470,VINCENT,470,"If you're through havin' your little
hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get
your needle and git it now!"
471,LANCE,471,"Are you deaf? You're not bringin'
that fucked up bitch in my house!"
472,VINCENT,472,"This fucked up bitch is Marsellus
Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'
croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But
before he turns me into a bar soap,
I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about
how you coulda saved her life, but
instead you let her die on your front
lawn."
473,JODY,473,"It's only one-thirty in the goddamn
mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on
out here?"
474,JODY,474,Who's she?
475,LANCE,475,"Get that black box in the bedroom I
have with the adrenaline shot."
476,JODY,476,What's wrong with her?
477,VINCENT,477,She's ODing on us.
478,JODY,478,Well get her the hell outta here!
479,LANCE AND VINCENT,479,Get the fuckin' shot!
480,JODY,480,Don't yell and me!
481,VINCENT,481,You two are a match made in heaven.
482,LANCE,482,"Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?
While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta
get a medical book."
483,VINCENT,483,What do you need a medical book for?
484,LANCE,484,"To tell me how to do it. I've never
given an adrenaline shot before."
485,VINCENT,485,"You've had that thing for six years
and you never used it?"
486,LANCE,486,"I never had to use it. I don't go
joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all
of my friends can handle their highs!"
487,VINCENT,487,Well then get it.
488,LANCE,488,"I am, if you'll let me."
489,VINCENT,489,I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.
490,LANCE,490,"Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'
to her."
491,VINCENT (O.S.),491,Hurry up man! We're losin' her!
492,LANCE,492,I'm looking as fast as I can!
493,JODY (O.S.),493,What's he lookin' for?
494,VINCENT (O.S.),494,"I dunno, some medical book."
495,JODY (O.S.),495,What are you lookin' for?
496,LANCE,496,My black medical book!
497,JODY,497,Whata're you looking for?
498,LANCE,498,"My black fuckin' medical book. It's
like a text book they give to nurses."
499,JODY,499,I never saw a medical book.
500,LANCE,500,"Trust me, I have one."
501,JODY,501,"Well if it's that important, why
didn't you keep it with the shot?"
502,LANCE,502,I don't know! Stop bothering me!
503,JODY,503,"While you're lookin' for it, that
girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're
never gonna find it in all this shit.
For six months now, I've been telling
you to clean this room "
504,VINCENT (O.S.),504," get your ass in here, fuck the
book!"
505,VINCENT,505,"Quit fuckin' around man and give her
the shot!"
506,LANCE,506,"While I'm doing this, take her shirt
off and find her heart."
507,VINCENT,507,Does it have to be exact?
508,LANCE,508,"Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving
her an injection in the heart, so I
gotta exactly hit her in the heart."
509,VINCENT,509,"Well, I don't know exactly where her
heart is, I think it's here."
510,LANCE,510,That's it.
511,VINCENT,511,"I need a big fat magic marker, got
one?"
512,JODY,512,What?
513,VINCENT,513,"I need a big fat magic marker, any
felt pen'll do, but a magic marker
would be great."
514,JODY,514,Hold on.
515,LANCE,515,"It's ready, I'll tell you what to
do."
516,VINCENT,516,You're gonna give her the shot.
517,LANCE,517,"No, you're gonna give her the shot."
518,VINCENT,518,I've never does this before.
519,LANCE,519,"I've never done this before either,
and I ain't starting now. You brought
'er here, that means you give her
the shot. The day I bring an ODing
bitch to your place, then I gotta
give her the shot."
520,JODY,520,Got it.
521,VINCENT,521,"Okay, what do I do?"
522,LANCE,522,"Well, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.
But she's got a breast plate in front
of her heart, so you gotta pierce
through that. So what you gotta do
is bring the needle down in a stabbing
motion."
523,VINCENT,523,I gotta stab her?
524,LANCE,524,"If you want the needle to pierce
through to her heart, you gotta stab
her hard."
525,VINCENT,525,What happens after that?
526,LANCE,526,I'm curious about that myself.
527,VINCENT,527,This ain't a fuckin' joke man!
528,LANCE,528,"She's supposed to come out of it
like "
529,LANCE,529, that.
530,VINCENT,530,Count to three.
531,LANCE,531,One...
532,LANCE (O.S.),532,...two...
533,LANCE (O.S.),533,...three!
534,LANCE,534,"If you're okay, say something."
535,MIA,535,Something.
536,JODY,536,Anybody want a beer?
537,VINCENT (O.S.),537,Mia!
538,VINCENT,538,"What are your thoughts on how to
handle this?"
539,MIA,539,What's yours?
540,VINCENT,540,"Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus
can live his whole live and never
ever hear of this incident."
541,MIA,541,"Don't worry about it. If Marsellus
ever heard of this, I'd be in as
much trouble as you."
542,VINCENT,542,I seriously doubt that.
543,MIA,543,"If you can keep a secret, so can I."
544,VINCENT,544,Let's shake on it.
545,VINCENT,545,Mum's the word.
546,VINCENT,546,"If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home
and have a heart attack."
547,MIA,547,"You still wanna hear my ""FOX FORCE
FIVE"" joke?"
548,VINCENT,548,"Sure, but I think I'm still a little
too petrified to laugh."
549,MIA,549,"Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's
not funny. But if you still wanna
hear it, I'll tell it."
550,VINCENT,550,I can't wait.
551,MIA,551,"Three tomatoes are walking down the
street, a poppa tomato, a momma
tomato, and a little baby tomato.
The baby tomato is lagging behind
the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa
tomato gets mad, goes over to the
momma tomato and stamps on him "
552,MIA,552, and says: catch up.
553,MIA,553,"See ya 'round, Vince."
554,WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.),554,Butch.
555,MOTHER,555,"Butch, stop watching TV a second. We
got a special visitor. Now do you
remember when I told you your daddy
dies in a P.O.W. camp?"
556,BUTCH (O.S.),556,Uh-huh.
557,MOTHER,557,"Well this here is Capt. Koons. He
was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy."
558,CAPT. KOONS,558,"Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard
a bunch about you. See, I was a good
friend of your Daddy's. We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five
years together.  Hopefully, you'll
never have to experience this
yourself, but when two men are in a
situation like me and your Daddy
were, for as long as we were, you
take on certain responsibilities of
the other. If it had been me who had
not made it, Major Coolidge would be
talkin' right now to my son Jim. But
the way it worked out is I'm talkin'
to you, Butch. I got somethin' for
ya."
559,CAPT. KOONS,559,"This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy.
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris. It
was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until
then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty,
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
can. And in that can it stayed 'til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
good as his old man's. Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island. Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it. None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin' that island alive. So
three days before the Japanese took
the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man
he had never met before in his life,
to deliver to his infant son, who he
had never seen in the flesh, his
gold watch. Three days later, your
grandfather was dead. But Winocki
kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant
father, his Dad's gold watch. This
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
be confiscated. The way your Daddy
looked at it, that watch was your
birthright. And he'd be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'.
His ass. Five long years, he wore
this watch up his ass. Then when he
died of dysentery, he gave me the
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.
Then, after seven years, I was sent
home to my family. And now, little
man, I give the watch to you."
560,KLONDIKE,560,"It's time, Butch."
561,BUTCH,561,I'm ready.
562,SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.),562," Well Dan, that had to be the
bloodiest and, hands-down, the most
brutal fight this city has ever seen."
563,SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.),563,"...Coolidge was out of there faster
than I've ever seen a victorious
boxer vacate the ring. Do you think
he knew Willis was dead?"
564,SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.),564,"My guess would be yes, Richard. I
could see from my position here, the
frenzy in his eyes give way to the
realization of what he was doing. I
think any man would've left the ring
that fast."
565,SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.),565,"Do you feel this ring death tragedy
will have an effect on the world of
boxing?"
566,SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.),566,"Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't
help but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundation. But it's of
paramount importance that during the
sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the
W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the "
567,ESMARELDA,567,"Are you the man I was supposed to
pick up?"
568,BUTCH,568,"If you're the cab I called, I'm the
guy you're supposed to pick up."
569,ESMARELDA,569,Where to?
570,BUTCH,570,Outta here.
571,VINCENT,571,Mia. How you doin'?
572,MIA,572,"Great. I never thanked you for the
dinner."
573,MARSELLUS (O.S.),573,What'cha got?
574,ENGLISH DAVE,574,He booked.
575,MARSELLUS (O.S.),575,"I'm prepared to scour the earth for
this motherfucker. If Butch goes to
Indo China, I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a
cap in his ass."
576,ENGLISH DAVE,576,I'll take care of it.
577,BUTCH,577,"Hey, how do I open the window back
here?"
578,ESMARELDA,578,I have to do it.
579,ESMARELDA,579,"Hey, mister?"
580,BUTCH,580,What?
581,ESMARELDA,581,"You were in that fight? The fight on
the radio  you're the fighter?"
582,BUTCH,582,Whatever gave you that idea?
583,ESMARELDA,583,"No c'mon, you're him, I know you're
him, tell me you're him."
584,BUTCH,584,I'm him.
585,ESMARELDA,585,You killed the other boxing man.
586,BUTCH,586,He's dead?
587,ESMARELDA,587,The radio said he was dead.
588,BUTCH,588,"Sorry 'bout that, Floyd."
589,ESMARELDA,589,What does it feel like?
590,BUTCH,590,What does what feel like?
591,ESMARELDA,591,"Killing a man. Beating another man
to death with your bare hands."
592,BUTCH,592,Are you some kinda weirdo?
593,ESMARELDA,593,"No, it's a subject I have much
interest in. You are the first person
I ever met who has killed somebody.
So, what was it like to kill a man?"
594,BUTCH,594,"Tell ya what, you give me one of
them cigarettes, I'll give you an
answer."
595,ESMARELDA,595,Deal!
596,BUTCH,596,So...
597,BUTCH,597,"...Esmarelda Villalobos  is that
Mexican?"
598,ESMARELDA,598,"The name is Spanish, but I'm
Columbian."
599,BUTCH,599,It's a very pretty name.
600,ESMARELDA,600,"It mean ""Esmarelda of the wolves."""
601,BUTCH,601,"That's one hell of a name you got
there, sister."
602,ESMARELDA,602,Thank you. And what is your name?
603,BUTCH,603,Butch.
604,ESMARELDA,604,Butch. What does it mean?
605,BUTCH,605,"I'm an American, our names don't
mean shit. Anyway, moving right along,
what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?"
606,ESMARELDA,606,"I want to know what it feels like to
kill a man "
607,BUTCH,607," I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know
he was dead 'til you told me he was
dead. Now I know he's dead, do you
wanna know how I feel about it?"
608,BUTCH,608,"I don't feel the least little bit
bad."
609,BUTCH,609,"What'd I tell ya, soon as the word
got out a fix was in, the odds would
be outta control. Hey, if he was a
better fighter he's be alive. If he
never laced up his gloves in the
first place, which he never shoulda
done, he'd be alive. Enough about
the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's
talk about the rich and prosperous
Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you
spread it around with?"
610,(PAUSE),610,Eight? How long to collect?
611,(PAUSE),611,"So by tomorrow evening, you'll have
it all?"
612,(PAUSE),612,"Good news Scotty, real good news  I
understand a few stragglers aside.
Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in
the morning. It should take us a
couple days to get into Knoxville.
Next time we see each other, it'll
be on Tennessee time."
613,BUTCH,613,"Fabienne my love, our adventure
begins."
614,ESMARELDA,614,Forty-five sixty.
615,BUTCH,615,"Merci beaucoup. And here's a little
something for the effort."
616,BUTCH,616,"Now if anybody should ask you about
who your fare was tonight, what're
you gonna tell 'em?"
617,ESMARELDA,617,"The truth. Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted, Mexicans."
618,BUTCH,618,"Bon soir, Esmarelda."
619,ESMARELDA,619,"Sleep well, Butch."
620,FABIENNE,620,Keep the light off.
621,BUTCH,621,"Is that better, sugar pop?"
622,FABIENNE,622,Oui. Hard day at the office?
623,BUTCH,623,Pretty hard. I got into a fight.
624,FABIENNE,624,Poor baby. Can we make spoons?
625,FABIENNE,625,I was looking at myself in the mirror.
626,BUTCH,626,Uh-huh?
627,FABIENNE,627,I wish I had a pot.
628,BUTCH,628,"You were lookin' in the mirror and
you wish you had some pot?"
629,FABIENNE,629,"A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are
sexy."
630,BUTCH,630,"Well you should be happy, 'cause you
do."
631,FABIENNE,631,"Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna
when she did ""Lucky Star,"" it's not
the same thing."
632,BUTCH,632,"I didn't realize there was a
difference between a tummy and a pot
belly."
633,FABIENNE,633,The difference is huge.
634,BUTCH,634,You want me to have a pot?
635,FABIENNE,635,"No. Pot bellies make a man look either
oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a
woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The
rest of you is normal. Normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal
ass, but with a big, perfectly round
pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a
tee-shirt two sizes too small to
accentuate it."
636,BUTCH,636,"You think guys would find that
attractive?"
637,FABIENNE,637,"I don't give a damn what men find
attractive. It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch and
pleasing to the eye is seldom the
same."
638,BUTCH,638,"If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in
it."
639,FABIENNE,639,You'd punch me in my belly?
640,BUTCH,640,Right in the belly.
641,FABIENNE,641,"I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your
right on your face 'til you couldn't
breathe."
642,BUTCH,642,You'd do that to me?
643,FABIENNE,643,Yes!
644,BUTCH,644,"Did you get everything, sugar pop?"
645,FABIENNE,645,"Yes, I did."
646,BUTCH,646,Good job.
647,FABIENNE,647,Did everything go as planned?
648,BUTCH,648,You didn't listen to the radio?
649,FABIENNE,649,"I never listen to your fights. Were
you the winner?"
650,BUTCH,650,I won alright.
651,FABIENNE,651,Are you still retiring?
652,BUTCH,652,Sure am.
653,FABIENNE,653,What about the man you fought?
654,BUTCH,654,Floyd retired too.
655,FABIENNE,655,"Really?! He won't be fighting no
more?!"
656,BUTCH,656,Not no more.
657,FABIENNE,657,So it all worked out in the finish?
658,BUTCH,658,"We ain't at the finish, baby."
659,FABIENNE,659,"We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?"
660,FABIENNE,660,"If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?"
661,FABIENNE,661,"But they won't find us, will they?"
662,FABIENNE,662,Do you still want me to go with you?
663,FABIENNE,663,"I don't want to be a burden or a
nuisance -"
664,FABIENNE,664,Say it!
665,BUTCH,665,"Fabienne, I want you to be with me."
666,FABIENNE,666,Forever?
667,BUTCH,667,...and ever.
668,FABIENNE,668,Do you love me?
669,BUTCH,669,Oui.
670,FABIENNE,670,Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?
671,BUTCH,671,Will you kiss it?
672,FABIENNE,672,But you first.
673,FABIENNE,673,"Butch my love, the adventure begins."
674,BUTCH,674,I think I cracked a rib.
675,FABIENNE,675,Giving me oral pleasure?
676,BUTCH,676,"No retard, from the fight."
677,FABIENNE,677,Don't call me retard.
678,BUTCH,678,My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!
679,FABIENNE,679,"Shut up fuck head! I hate that
Mongoloid voice."
680,BUTCH,680,"Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it
back!  Can I have a towel please,
Miss Beautiful Tulip."
681,FABIENNE,681,"Oh I like that, I like being called
a tulip. Tulip is much better than
Mongoloid."
682,BUTCH,682,"I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I
called you a retard, but I took it
back."
683,BUTCH,683,Merci beaucoup.
684,FABIENNE,684,Butch?
685,BUTCH,685,"Yes, lemon pie."
686,FABIENNE,686,Where are we going to go?
687,BUTCH,687,"I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot of money from
this. But it ain't gonna be so much,
we can live like hogs in the fat
house forever. I was thinking we
could go somewhere in the South
Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll
carry us a long way down there."
688,FABIENNE,688,"So if we wanted, we could live in
Bora Bora?"
689,BUTCH,689,"You betcha. And if after awhile you
don't dig Bora Bora, then we can
move over to Tahiti or Mexico."
690,FABIENNE,690,But I do not speak Spanish.
691,BUTCH,691,"You don't speak Bora Boran either.
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta
el zapataria?"
692,FABIENNE,692,What does that mean?
693,BUTCH,693,Where's the shoe store?
694,FABIENNE,694,Donde esta el zapataria?
695,BUTCH,695,"Excellent pronunciation. You'll be
my little mama ceta in no time."
696,BUTCH (O.S.),696,Que hora es?
697,FABIENNE,697,Que hora es?
698,BUTCH (O.S.),698,What time is it?
699,FABIENNE,699,What time is it?
700,BUTCH (O.S.),700,"Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean."
701,FABIENNE,701,Butch.
702,FABIENNE,702,Forget it.
703,FABIENNE,703,"Merde! You startled me. Did you have
a bad dream?"
704,BUTCH,704,What are you watching?
705,FABIENNE,705,"A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the
name."
706,BUTCH,706,Are you watchin' it?
707,FABIENNE,707,"In a way. Why? Would you like for me
to switch it off?"
708,BUTCH,708,Would you please?
709,BUTCH,709,"It's a little too early in the morning
for explosions and war."
710,FABIENNE,710,What was it about?
711,BUTCH,711,"How should I know, you were the one
watchin' it."
712,FABIENNE,712,"No, imbecile, what was your dream
about?"
713,BUTCH,713,"Oh, I... don't remember. It's really
rare I remember a dream."
714,FABIENNE,714,You just woke up from it.
715,BUTCH,715,"Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I
don't remember."
716,FABIENNE,716,"Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning. I didn't say you
were lying, it's just odd you don't
remember your dreams. I always
remember mine. Did you know you talk
in your sleep?"
717,BUTCH,717,"I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
in my sleep?"
718,FABIENNE,718,You did last night.
719,BUTCH,719,What did I say?
720,FABIENNE,720,"I don't know. I couldn't understand
you."
721,FABIENNE,721,"Why don't you get up and we'll get
some breakfast at that breakfast
place with the pancakes."
722,BUTCH,722,One more kiss and I'll get up.
723,FABIENNE,723,Satisfied?
724,BUTCH,724,Yep.
725,FABIENNE,725,"Then get up, lazy bones."
726,BUTCH,726,What time is it?
727,FABIENNE,727,"Almost nine in the morning. What
time does our train arrive?"
728,BUTCH,728,Eleven.
729,FABIENNE,729,"I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,
eggs over easy, and five sausages."
730,BUTCH,730,Anything to drink with that?
731,FABIENNE,731,"Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a
tall glass or orange juice and a
black cup of coffee. After that, I'm
going to have a slice of pie."
732,BUTCH,732,Pie for breakfast?
733,FABIENNE,733,"Any time of the day is a good time
for pie. Blueberry pie to go with
the pancakes. And on top, a thin
slice of melted cheese "
734,BUTCH,734, where's my watch?
735,FABIENNE,735,It's there.
736,BUTCH,736,"No, it's not. It's not here."
737,FABIENNE,737,Have you looked?
738,BUTCH,738,Yes I've fuckin' looked!!
739,BUTCH,739,"What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
Are you sure you got it?"
740,FABIENNE,740,Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
741,BUTCH,741, on the little kangaroo.
742,FABIENNE,742,"Yes, it was on your little kangaroo."
743,BUTCH,743,Well it's not here!
744,FABIENNE,744,Well it should be!
745,BUTCH,745,"Oh it most definitely should be here,
but it's not. So where is it?"
746,BUTCH,746,"Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'
watch. You know what my father went
through to git me that watch?... I
don't wanna get into it right now...
but he went through a lot. Now all
this other shit, you coulda set on
fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget my father's watch.
Now think, did you get it?"
747,FABIENNE,747,I believe so...
748,BUTCH,748,"You believe so? You either did, or
you didn't, now which one is it?"
749,FABIENNE,749,Then I did.
750,BUTCH,750,Are you sure?
751,FABIENNE,751,No.
752,BUTCH,752,No! It's not your fault.
753,BUTCH,753,You left it at the apartment.
754,BUTCH,754,"If you did leave it at the apartment,
it's not your fault. I had you bring
a bunch of stuff. I reminded you
about it, but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me. If
all I gave a fuck about was my watch,
I should've told you. You ain't a
mind reader."
755,FABIENNE,755,I'm sorry.
756,BUTCH,756,"Don't be. It just means I won't be
able to eat breakfast with you."
757,FABIENNE,757,Why does it mean that?
758,BUTCH,758,"Because I'm going back to my apartment
to get my watch."
759,FABIENNE,759,"Won't the gangsters be looking for
you there?"
760,BUTCH,760,"That's what I'm gonna find out. If
they are, and I don't think I can
handle it, I'll split."
761,FABIENNE,761,"I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry."
762,BUTCH,762,"Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing
you could ever do would make me
permanently angry at you."
763,BUTCH,763,"I love you, remember?"
764,BUTCH,764,"Now here's some money, order those
pancakes and have a great breakfast."
765,FABIENNE,765,Don't go.
766,BUTCH,766,"I'll be back before you can say,
blueberry pie."
767,FABIENNE,767,Blueberry pie.
768,BUTCH,768,"Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
Okay?  Okay?"
769,FABIENNE,769,Okay.
770,BUTCH,770,"Bye-bye, sugar pop."
771,FABIENNE,771,Bye.
772,BUTCH,772,I'm gonna take your Honda.
773,FABIENNE,773,Okay.
774,BUTCH,774,"Of all the fuckin' things she coulda
forgot, she forgets my father's watch.
I specifically reminded her not to
forget it. ""Bedside table  on the
kangaroo."" I said the words: ""Don't
forget my father's watch."""
775,BUTCH,775,Holy shit.
776,BUTCH,776,"That's how you're gonna beat 'em,
Butch.  They keep underestimatin'
ya."
777,PEDESTRIAN,777,"Jesus, are you okay?"
778,BUTCH,778,I guess.
779,GAWKER #1,779,He's dead! He's dead!
780,GAWKER #2,780,"If you need a witness in court, I'll
be glad to help. He was a drunken
maniac. He hit you and crashed into
that car."
781,MARSELLUS,781,Who?
782,GAWKER #2,782,Him.
783,MARSELLUS,783,"Well, I'll be damned."
784,BUTCH,784,Sacre bleu.
785,LOOKY-LOO WOMAN,785,"Oh my God, I've been shot!"
786,MAYNARD,786,Can I help you wit' somethin'?
787,BUTCH,787,Shut up!
788,MAYNARD,788,Now you just wait one goddamn minute
789,BUTCH,789,"So you like chasing people, huh?"
790,BUTCH,790,"Well guess what, big man, you caught
me "
791,MAYNARD (O.S.),791," hold it right there, godammit!"
792,BUTCH,792,"Look mister, this ain't any of your
business "
793,MAYNARD,793," I'm makin' it my business! Now
toss that gun!"
794,MAYNARD,794,"Now you on top, stand up and come to
the counter."
795,MAYNARD,795,"Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just
caught a coupl'a flies."
796,MAYNARD,796,"Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed."
797,MAYNARD,797,That's Zed.
798,ZED,798,You said you waited for me?
799,MAYNARD,799,I did.
800,ZED,800,Then how come they're all beat up?
801,MAYNARD,801,"They did that to each other. They
was fightin' when they came in. This
one was gonna shoot that one."
802,ZED,802,You were gonna shoot him?
803,ZED,803,"Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front
of this place?"
804,MAYNARD,804,"Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?"
805,ZED,805,"No, it's Thursday."
806,MAYNARD,806,Then she'll be fine.
807,ZED,807,Bring out The Gimp.
808,MAYNARD,808,I think The Gimp's sleepin'.
809,ZED,809,"Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em
up then, won't you?"
810,MAYNARD,810,Wake up!
811,MAYNARD,811,Down!
812,MAYNARD,812,Who's first?
813,ZED,813,I ain't fer sure yet.
814,ZED,814,Wanna do it here?
815,MAYNARD,815,"Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old
room."
816,MAYNARD,816,Up!
817,MAYNARD,817,Keep an eye on this one.
818,MAYNARD (O.S.),818,"Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight
in 'em!"
819,ZED (O.S.),819,"You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
Good, I like to fight!"
820,MAYNARD (O.S.),820,"That's it... that's it boy, you're
goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like
that... that's good."
821,MAYNARD (O.S.),821,"Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!
Zed goddammit, git over here and
hold 'em!"
822,THE GIMP,822,Huhng?
823,BUTCH,823,Hey hillbilly.
824,BUTCH,824,"You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up."
825,MARSELLUS (O.S.),825,"Step aside, Butch."
826,BUTCH,826,You okay?
827,MARSELLUS,827,"Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from
okay!"
828,BUTCH,828,What now?
829,MARSELLUS,829,"What now? Well let me tell you what
now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
hittin' niggers, who'll go to work
on homes here with a pair of pliers
and a blow torch."
830,MARSELLUS,830,"Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I
ain't through with you by a damn
sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on
your ass."
831,BUTCH,831,"I meant what now, between me and
you?"
832,MARSELLUS,832,"Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell
ya what now between me an' you. There
is no me an' you. Not no more."
833,BUTCH,833,So we're cool?
834,MARSELLUS,834,"Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I
ask  two things I ask: Don't tell
nobody about this. This shit's between
me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It
ain't nobody else's business. Two:
leave town. Tonight. Right now. And
when you're gone, stay gone.  You've
lost your Los Angeles privileges.
Deal?"
835,BUTCH,835,Deal.
836,MARSELLUS,836,"Go on now, get your ass outta here."
837,MARSELLUS,837,"Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta
bit of a situation."
838,FABIENNE (O.S.),838,"Butch, I was so worried!"
839,BUTCH,839,"Honey, grab your radio and your purse
and let's go!"
840,FABIENNE (O.S.),840,But what about all our bags?
841,BUTCH,841,"Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train
if we don't split now."
842,FABIENNE (O.S.),842,Is everything well? Are we in danger?
843,BUTCH,843,"We're cool. In fact, we're super-
cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait
for you outside."
844,FABIENNE,844,Where did you get this motorcycle?
845,BUTCH,845,"It's a chopper, baby, hop on."
846,FABIENNE,846,What happened to my Honda?
847,BUTCH,847,"Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda."
848,FABIENNE,848,You're hurt?
849,BUTCH,849,"I might've broke my nose, no biggie.
Hop on."
850,BUTCH,850,"Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!"
851,BUTCH,851,"I'm sorry, baby-love."
852,FABIENNE,852,"You were gone so long, I started to
think dreadful thoughts."
853,BUTCH,853,"I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything's fine. Hey, how was
breakfast?"
854,FABIENNE,854,It was good 
855,BUTCH,855, did you get the blueberry pancakes?
856,FABIENNE,856,"No, they didn't have blueberry
pancakes, I had to get buttermilk 
are you sure you're okay?"
857,BUTCH,857,"Baby-love, from the moment I left
you, this has been without a doubt
the single weirdest day of my entire
life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about
it."
858,FABIENNE,858,"Butch, whose motorcycle is this?"
859,BUTCH,859,It's a chopper.
860,FABIENNE,860,Whose chopper is this?
861,BUTCH,861,Zed's.
862,FABIENNE,862,Who's Zed?
863,BUTCH,863,"Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead."
864,JULES (O.S.),864,"You ever read the Bible, Brett?"
865,BRETT (O.S.),865,Yes!
866,JULES (O.S.),866,"There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men..."""
867,JULES (O.S.),867,"""...blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will, shepherded
the weak through the valley of
darkness. And I will strike down
upon thee with great vengeance and
furious anger those who attempt to
poison and destroy my brothers. And
you will know I am the Lord when I
lay my vengeance upon you."""
868,VINCENT (O.S.),868,Friend of yours?
869,JULES (O.S.),869,"Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin."
870,FOURTH MAN,870,Die... die... die... die...!
871,FOURTH MAN,871,I don't understand 
872,VINCENT,872,"Why the fuck didn't you tell us about
that guy in the bathroom? Slip your
mind?  Forget he was in there with a
goddamn hand cannon?"
873,JULES,873,We should be fuckin' dead right now.
874,JULES,874,"Did you see that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him."
875,VINCENT,875,.357.
876,JULES,876,We should be fuckin' dead!
877,VINCENT,877,"Yeah, we were lucky."
878,JULES,878,"That shit wasn't luck. That shit was
somethin' else."
879,VINCENT,879,"Yeah, maybe."
880,JULES,880,"That was... divine intervention. You
know what divine intervention is?"
881,VINCENT,881,"Yeah, I think so. That means God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets."
882,JULES,882,"Yeah, man, that's what is means.
That's exactly what it means! God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets."
883,VINCENT,883,I think we should be going now.
884,JULES,884,"Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do
that!  Don't blow this shit off!
What just happened was a fuckin'
miracle!"
885,VINCENT,885,"Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit
happens."
886,JULES,886,"Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just
happen."
887,VINCENT,887,"Do you wanna continue this theological
discussion in the car, or at the
jailhouse with the cops?"
888,JULES,888,"We should be fuckin' dead now, my
friend!  We just witnessed a miracle,
and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge
it!"
889,VINCENT,889,"Okay man, it was a miracle, can we
leave now?"
890,VINCENT,890,"...Ever seen that show ""COPS?""  I
was watchin' it once and this cop
was on it who was talkin' about this
time he got into this gun fight with
a guy in a hallway. He unloads on
this guy and he doesn't hit anything.
And these guys were in a hallway.
It's a freak, but it happens."
891,JULES,891,"If you wanna play blind man, then go
walk with a Shepherd. But me, my
eyes are wide fuckin' open."
892,VINCENT,892,What the fuck does that mean?
893,JULES,893,"That's it for me. For here on in,
you can consider my ass retired."
894,VINCENT,894,Jesus Christ!
895,JULES,895,Don't blaspheme!
896,VINCENT,896,"Goddammit, Jules "
897,JULES,897, I said don't do that 
898,VINCENT,898, you're fuckin' freakin' out!
899,JULES,899,"I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm
through."
900,VINCENT,900,"While you're at it, be sure to tell
'im why."
901,JULES,901,"Don't worry, I will."
902,VINCENT,902,"I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he
laughs his ass off."
903,JULES,903,I don't give a damn if he does.
904,VINCENT,904,"Marvin, what do you make of all this?"
905,MARVIN,905,I don't even have an opinion.
906,VINCENT,906,"C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came
down from Heaven and stopped the
bullets?"
907,JULES,907,What the fuck's happening?
908,VINCENT,908,"I just accidentally shot Marvin in
the throat."
909,JULES,909,Why the fuck did you do that?
910,VINCENT,910,"I didn't mean to do it. I said it
was an accident."
911,JULES,911,"I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in
my time "
912,VINCENT,912," chill out, man, it was an accident,
okay? You hit a bump or somethin'
and the gun went off."
913,JULES,913,"The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'
bump!"
914,VINCENT,914,"Look! I didn't mean to shoot this
son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went
off, don't ask me how!"
915,JULES,915,"Look at this mess! We're drivin'
around on a city street in broad
daylight "
916,VINCENT,916," I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'
about the splatter."
917,JULES,917,"Well you better be thinkin' about it
now, motherfucker! We gotta get this
car off the road. Cops tend to notice
shit like you're driving a car
drenched in fuckin' blood."
918,VINCENT,918,"Can't we just take it to a friendly
place?"
919,JULES,919,"This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus
don't got no friendly places in the
Valley."
920,VINCENT,920,"Well, don't look at me, this is your
town, Jules."
921,VINCENT,921,Who ya callin'?
922,JULES,922,A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.
923,VINCENT,923,Where's Toluca Lake.
924,JULES,924,"On the other side of the hill, by
Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass
ain't home, I don't know what the
fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any
other partners in 818."
925,JULES,925,"Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules."
926,JULES,926,"Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are
in some serious shit. We're in a car
we gotta get off the road, pronto! I
need to use your garage for a couple
hours."
927,JULES,927,"We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie's situation. He's
one remark away from kickin' our
asses out the door."
928,VINCENT,928,"If he kicks us out, whadda we do?"
929,JULES,929,"Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made
a couple phone calls. But I never
want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's
my friend and you don't bust in your
friend's house and start tellin' 'im
what's what."
930,VINCENT,930,"Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He
kinda freaked out back there when he
saw Marvin."
931,JULES,931,"Put yourself in his position. It's
eight o'clock in the morning. He
just woke up, he wasn't prepared for
this shit. Don't forget who's doin'
who a favor."
932,VINCENT,932,"If the price of that favor is I gotta
take shit, he can stick his favor
straight up his ass."
933,JULES,933,"What the fuck did you just do to his
towel?"
934,VINCENT,934,I was just dryin' my hands.
935,JULES,935,You're supposed to wash 'em first.
936,VINCENT,936,You watched me wash 'em.
937,JULES,937,I watched you get 'em wet.
938,VINCENT,938,"I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to
get off. Maybe if he had some Lava,
I coulda done a better job."
939,JULES,939,"I used the same soap you did and
when I dried my hands, the towel
didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie
pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who
cares? But it's shit like this that's
gonna bring this situation to a boil.
If he were to come in here and see
that towel like that... I'm tellin'
you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause
if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie
on account of you... Look, I ain't
threatenin' you, I respect you an'
all, just don't put me in that
position."
940,JULES,940,"Jules, you ask me nice like that, no
problem. He's your friend, you handle
him."
941,JULES,941,"Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious
gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda
been satisfied with freeze-dried
Tasters Choice. You spring this
gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What
flavor is this?"
942,JIMMIE,942,"Knock it off, Julie."
943,JULES,943,What?
944,JIMMIE,944,"I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can
stop butterin' me up. I don't need
you to tell me how good my coffee
is. I'm the one who buys it, I know
how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie
goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy
the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But what's on my mind at this moment
isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's
the dead nigger in my garage."
945,JULES,945,Jimmie 
946,JIMMIE,946," I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a
question, Jules. When you drove in
here, did you notice a sign out front
that said, ""Dead nigger storage?"""
947,JIMMIE,947," answer to question. Did you see a
sign out in front of my house that
said, ""Dead nigger storage?"""
948,JULES,948,"Naw man, I didn't."
949,JIMMIE,949,"You know why you didn't see that
sign?"
950,JULES,950,Why?
951,JIMMIE,951,"'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my
fuckin' business!"
952,JIMMIE,952," I ain't through! Now don't you
understand that if Bonnie comes home
and finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage
counselor, no trial separation 
fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced. The last time
me an' Bonnie talked about this shit
was gonna be the last time me an'
Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I
wanna help ya out Julie, I really
do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife
doin' it."
953,JULES,953,Jimmie 
954,JIMMIE,954," don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I
can't be Jimmied. There's nothin'
you can say that's gonna make me
forget I love my wife. Now she's
workin' the graveyard shift at the
hospital. She'll be comin' home in
less than an hour and a half. Make
your phone calls, talk to your people,
than get the fuck out of my house."
955,JULES,955,"That's all we want. We don't wanna
fuck up your shit. We just need to
call our people to bring us in."
956,JIMMIE,956,"Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's
in my bedroom."
957,MARSELLUS,957,"...well, say she comes home. Whaddya
think she'll do?"
958,MARSELLUS,958,"No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That
ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,
I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?"
959,JULES,959,"You got to appreciate what an
explosive element this Bonnie
situation is. If she comes home from
a hard day's work and finds a bunch
of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'
shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'
what she's apt to do."
960,MARSELLUS,960,"I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm
doin' is contemplating the ""ifs."""
961,JULES,961,"I don't wanna hear about no
motherfuckin' ""ifs.""What I wanna
hear from your ass is: ""you ain't
got no problems, Jules. I'm on the
motherfucker. Go back in there, chill
them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be comin'
directly."""
962,MARSELLUS,962,"You ain't got no problems, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in
there, chill them niggers out and
wait for The Wolf, who should be
comin' directly."
963,JULES,963,You sendin' The Wolf?
964,MARSELLUS,964,Feel better?
965,JULES,965,"Shit Negro, that's all you had to
say."
966,THE WOLF,966,Is she the hysterical type?
967,THE WOLF,967,When she due?
968,THE WOLF,968,Give me the principals' names again?
969,THE WOLF,969,Jules...
970,THE WOLF,970,...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...
971,THE WOLF,971,"Expect a call around 10:30. It's
about thirty minutes away. I'll be
there in ten."
972,THE WOLF,972,"You're Jimmie, right? This is your
house?"
973,JIMMIE,973,Yeah.
974,THE WOLF,974,"I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems."
975,JIMMIE,975,"Good, 'cause we got one."
976,THE WOLF,976,So I heard. May I come in?
977,JIMMIE,977,Please do.
978,THE WOLF,978,"You must be Jules, which would make
you Vincent. Let's get down to brass
tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed
correctly, the clock is ticking, is
that right, Jimmie?"
979,JIMMIE,979,100%.
980,THE WOLF,980,"Your wife, Bonnie..."
981,THE WOLF,981,"...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is
that correct?"
982,JIMMIE,982,Uh-huh.
983,THE WOLF,983,"I was led to believe if she comes
home and finds us here, she wouldn't
appreciate it none too much."
984,JIMMIE,984,She won't at that.
985,THE WOLF,985,"That gives us forty minutes to get
the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you
do what I say when I say it, should
by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a
car, minus a head, in a garage. Take
me to it."
986,THE WOLF,986,Jimmie?
987,JIMMIE,987,Yes.
988,THE WOLF,988,"Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee in there. Would
you make me a cup?"
989,JIMMIE,989,"Sure, how do you take it?"
990,THE WOLF,990,"Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar."
991,THE WOLF,991,"About the car, is there anything I
need to know? Does it stall, does it
make a lot of noise, does it smoke,
is there gas in it, anything?"
992,JULES,992,"Aside from how it looks, the car's
cool."
993,THE WOLF,993,"Positive?  Don't get me out on the
road and I find out the brake lights
don't work."
994,JULES,994,"Hey man, as far as I know, the
motherfucker's tip-top."
995,THE WOLF,995,"Good enough, let's go back to the
kitchen."
996,THE WOLF,996,"Thank you, Jimmie."
997,THE WOLF,997,"Okay first thing, you two."
998,THE WOLF,998,"Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty
domesticated house. That would lead
me to believe that in the garage or
under the sink, you got a bunch of
cleansers and cleaners and shit like
that, am I correct?"
999,JIMMIE,999,Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.
1000,THE WOLF,1000,"Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car. And
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You
need to go in the backseat, scoop up
all those little pieces of brain and
skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe
down the upholstery  now when it
comes to upholstery, it don't need
to be spic and span, you don't need
to eat off it. Give it a good once
over. What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts. The pools
of blood that have collected, you
gotta soak that shit up.  But the
windows are a different story.  Them
you really clean. Get the Windex, do
a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to
raid your linen closet. I need
blankets, I need comforters, I need
quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker
the better, the darker the better.
No whites, can't use 'em. We need to
camouflage the interior of the car.
We're gonna line the front seat and
the backseat and the floor boards
with quilts and blankets. If a cop
stops us and starts stickin' his big
snout in the car, the subterfuge
won't last. But at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.  Jimmie 
lead the way, boys  get to work."
1001,VINCENT,1001,"A ""please"" would be nice."
1002,THE WOLF,1002,Come again?
1003,VINCENT,1003,"I said a ""please"" would be nice."
1004,THE WOLF,1004,"Set is straight, Buster. I'm not
here to say ""please.""I'm here to
tell you want to do. And if self-
preservation is an instinct you
possess, you better fuckin' do it
and do it quick. I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa
luck gentlemen."
1005,JULES,1005,"It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your
help is definitely appreciated."
1006,VINCENT,1006,"I don't mean any disrespect. I just
don't like people barkin' orders at
me."
1007,THE WOLF,1007,"If I'm curt with you, it's because
time is a factor. I think fast, I
talk fast, and I need you guys to
act fast if you want to get out of
this. So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car."
1008,THE WOLF,1008,It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
1009,THE WOLF,1009,White.
1010,THE WOLF,1010,"Nothin', except for the mess inside."
1011,THE WOLF,1011,About twenty minutes.
1012,THE WOLF,1012,Nobody who'll be missed.
1013,THE WOLF,1013,"You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon."
1014,THE WOLF,1014,"How we comin', Jimmie?"
1015,JIMMIE,1015,"Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand
somethin' "
1016,THE WOLF,1016," Winston, Jimmie  please, Winston."
1017,JIMMIE,1017,"You gotta understand something,
Winston. I want to help you guys out
and all, but that's my best linen.
It was a wedding present from my
Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and
they ain't with us anymore "
1018,THE WOLF,1018," let me ask you a question, if you
don't mind?"
1019,JIMMIE,1019,Sure.
1020,THE WOLF,1020,"Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny
millionaires?"
1021,JIMMIE,1021,No.
1022,THE WOLF,1022,"Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And
I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and
Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they
would've furnished you with a whole
bedroom set, which your Uncle
Marsellus is more than happy to do."
1023,THE WOLF,1023,"I like oak myself, that's what's in
my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,
you an oak man?"
1024,JIMMIE,1024,Oak's nice.
1025,JULES,1025,"I will never forgive your ass for
this shit. This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit!"
1026,VINCENT,1026,"Did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he's wrong,
he's immediately forgiven for all
wrong-doings?"
1027,JULES,1027,"Man, get outta my face with that
shit! The motherfucker who said that
never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces
of skull with his fingers on account
of your dumb ass."
1028,VINCENT,1028,"I got a threshold, Jules. I got a
threshold for the abuse I'll take.
And you're crossin' it. I'm a race
car and you got me in the red. Redline
7000, that's where you are. Just
know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be
drivin' a race car when it's in the
red. It could blow."
1029,JULES,1029,"You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a
mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!
Every time my fingers touch brain
I'm ""SUPERFLY T.N.T,"" I'm the ""GUNS
OF NAVARONE."" I'm what Jimmie Walker
usta talk about. In fact, what the
fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're
the motherfucker should be on brain
detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'
windows and you're pickin' up this
nigger's skull."
1030,THE WOLF,1030,"Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out
of this yet."
1031,JIMMIE,1031,I can't believe that's the same car.
1032,THE WOLF,1032,"Well, let's not start suckin' each
other's dicks quite yet. Phase one
is complete, clean the car, which
moves us right along to phase two,
clean you two."
1033,THE WOLF,1033,Strip.
1034,VINCENT,1034,All the way?
1035,THE WOLF,1035,To your bare ass.
1036,THE WOLF,1036,"Quickly gentlemen, we got about
fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
half comes pulling into the driveway."
1037,JULES,1037,This morning air is some chilly shit.
1038,VINCENT,1038,"Are you sure this is absolutely
necessary?"
1039,THE WOLF,1039,You know what you two look like?
1040,VINCENT,1040,What?
1041,THE WOLF,1041,"Like a couple of guys who just blew
off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'
off those bloody rags is absolutely
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's
garbage bag."
1042,JULES,1042,"Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid
like puttin' that out in front of
your house for Elmo the garbage man
to take away."
1043,THE WOLF,1043,"Don't worry, we're takin' it with
us. Jim, the soap."
1044,THE WOLF,1044,"Okay gentlemen, you're both been to
County before, I'm sure. Here it
comes."
1045,JULES,1045,"Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!"
1046,THE WOLF,1046,"Better you than me, gentlemen."
1047,THE WOLF,1047,"Don't be afraid of the soap, spread
it around."
1048,THE WOLF,1048,Towel 'em.
1049,THE WOLF,1049,"You're dry enough, give 'em their
clothes."
1050,THE WOLF,1050,"Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've
planned this better. You guys look
like... what do they look like,
Jimmie?"
1051,JIMMIE,1051,"Dorks. They look like a couple of
dorks."
1052,JULES,1052,"Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker."
1053,JIMMIE,1053,"I guess you just gotta know how to
wear them."
1054,JULES,1054,"Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert
on wearin' dorky shit that your is."
1055,THE WOLF,1055,"C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and
jokin' our way into prison. Don't
make me beg."
1056,THE WOLF,1056,"Gentlemen, let's get our rules of
the road straight. We're going to a
place called Monster Joe's Truck and
Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood, so a
few twist and turns aside, we'll be
goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll
drive the tainted car. Jules, you
ride with me.  Vincent, you follow
in my Porsche. Now if we cross the
path of any John Q. Laws, nobody
does a fuckin' thing 'til I do
something."
1057,(TO JULES),1057,What did I say?
1058,JULES,1058,Don't do shit unless 
1059,THE WOLF,1059, unless what?
1060,JULES,1060,Unless you do it first.
1061,THE WOLF,1061,Spoken like a true prodigy.
1062,THE WOLF,1062,"How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and
jangling?"
1063,VINCENT,1063,"I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went
off, I dunno how."
1064,THE WOLF,1064,Fair enough.
1065,THE WOLF,1065,"I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep
up. If I get my car back any different
than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna
be disposing of two bodies."
1066,JULES,1066,We cool?
1067,WINSTON,1067,Like it never happened.
1068,WINSTON,1068,"Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all
this will be hers."
1069,RAQUEL,1069,"Hi. You know, if they ever do ""I
SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE,"" you guys,
I'd be great.  What's with the
outfits. You guys going to a
volleyball game?"
1070,WINSTON,1070,"I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.
Maybe I can drop you two off. Where
do you live?"
1071,VINCENT,1071,Redondo Beach.
1072,JULES,1072,Inglewood.
1073,WINSTON,1073,"It's your future: I see... a cab
ride."
1074,WINSTON,1074,"Sorry guys, move out of the sticks."
1075,WINSTON,1075,"Say goodbye, Raquel."
1076,RAQUEL,1076,"Goodbye, Raquel."
1077,WINSTON,1077,"I'll see you two around, and stay
outta trouble, you crazy kids."
1078,JULES,1078,Mr. Wolf.
1079,JULES,1079,I was a pleasure watchin' you work.
1080,WINSTON,1080,Call me Winston.
1081,WINSTON,1081,"You hear that, young lady? Respect.
You could lean a lot from those two
fine specimens. Respect for one's
elders shows character."
1082,RAQUEL,1082,I have character.
1083,WINSTON,1083,"Just because you are a character
doesn't mean you have character."
1084,RAQUEL,1084,"Oh you're so funny, oh you're so
funny."
1085,JULES,1085,Wanna share a cab?
1086,VINCENT,1086,"You know I could go for some
breakfast.  Want to have breakfast
with me?"
1087,JULES,1087,Sure.
1088,VINCENT,1088,Thanks a bunch.
1089,VINCENT,1089,Want a sausage?
1090,JULES,1090,"Naw, I don't eat pork."
1091,VINCENT,1091,Are you Jewish?
1092,JULES,1092,"I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig
on swine."
1093,VINCENT,1093,Why not?
1094,JULES,1094,"They're filthy animals. I don't eat
filthy animals."
1095,VINCENT,1095,"Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
good."
1096,JULES,1096,"A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if
it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy
motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in
shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't
wanna eat nothin' that ain't got
enough sense to disregard its own
feces."
1097,VINCENT,1097,"How about dogs? Dogs eat their own
feces."
1098,JULES,1098,I don't eat dog either.
1099,VINCENT,1099,"Yes, but do you consider a dog to be
a filthy animal?"
1100,JULES,1100,"I wouldn't go so far as to call a
dog filthy, but they're definitely
dirty. But a dog's got personality.
And personality goes a long way."
1101,VINCENT,1101,"So by that rationale, if a pig had a
better personality, he's cease to be
a filthy animal?"
1102,JULES,1102,"We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one
motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd
have to be the Cary Grant of pigs."
1103,VINCENT,1103,"Good for you. Lighten up a little.
You been sittin' there all quiet."
1104,JULES,1104,I just been sittin' here thinkin'.
1105,VINCENT,1105,About what?
1106,JULES,1106,The miracle we witnessed.
1107,VINCENT,1107,"The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed
a freak occurrence."
1108,JULES,1108,Do you know that a miracle is?
1109,VINCENT,1109,An act of God.
1110,JULES,1110,What's an act of God?
1111,VINCENT,1111,"I guess it's when God makes the
impossible possible. And I'm sorry
Jules, but I don't think what happened
this morning qualifies."
1112,JULES,1112,"Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't
matter. You're judging this thing
the wrong way. It's not about what.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found
my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge
shit like this based on merit. Whether
or not what we experienced was an
according-to-Hoyle miracle is
insignificant. What is significant
is I felt God's touch, God got
involved."
1113,VINCENT,1113,But why?
1114,JULES,1114,"That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I
don't know why. But I can't go back
to sleep."
1115,VINCENT,1115,"So you're serious, you're really
gonna quit?"
1116,JULES,1116,"The life, most definitely."
1117,PATRON,1117,Garcon! Coffee!
1118,VINCENT,1118,"So if you're quitting the life,
what'll you do?"
1119,JULES,1119,"That's what I've been sitting here
contemplating. First, I'm gonna
deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,
basically, I'm gonna walk the earth."
1120,VINCENT,1120,"What do you mean, walk the earth?"
1121,JULES,1121,"You know, like Caine in ""KUNG FU.""
Just walk from town to town, meet
people, get in adventures."
1122,VINCENT,1122,"How long do you intend to walk the
earth?"
1123,JULES,1123,"Until God puts me where he want me
to be."
1124,VINCENT,1124,What if he never does?
1125,JULES,1125,"If it takes forever, I'll wait
forever."
1126,VINCENT,1126,So you decided to be a bum?
1127,JULES,1127,"I'll just be Jules, Vincent  no
more, no less."
1128,VINCENT,1128,"No Jules, you're gonna be like those
pieces of shit out there who beg for
change. They walk around like a bunch
of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in
garbage bins, they eat what I throw
away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got
a word for 'em, they're called bums.
And without a job, residence, or
legal tender, that's what you're
gonna be  a fuckin' bum!"
1129,JULES,1129,"Look my friend, this is just where
me and you differ "
1130,VINCENT,1130," what happened was peculiar  no
doubt about it  but it wasn't water
into wine."
1131,JULES,1131,"All shapes and sizes, Vince."
1132,VINCENT,1132,Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!
1133,JULES,1133,"If you find my answers frightening,
Vincent, you should cease askin'
scary questions."
1134,VINCENT,1134,I gotta take a shit. To be continued.
1135,PUMPKIN,1135,"Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!"
1136,HONEY BUNNY,1136,"Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?!"
1137,PUMPKIN,1137,"Customers stay seated, waitresses on
the floor."
1138,HONEY BUNNY,1138,"Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,
do it or fucking die!"
1139,PUMPKIN,1139,"You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out
here!  Asta luego!"
1140,PUMPKIN,1140,"On the floor or I'll cook you ass,
comprende?"
1141,MANAGER,1141,"I'm the manager here, there's no
problem, no problem at all "
1142,PUMPKIN,1142,You're gonna give me a problem?
1143,PUMPKIN,1143,"What? You said you're gonna give me
a problem?"
1144,MANAGER,1144,"No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you
any problem!"
1145,PUMPKIN,1145,"I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks
like the hero type to me!"
1146,HONEY BUNNY,1146,Don't take any chances. Execute him!
1147,MANAGER,1147,"Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm
just a coffee shop manager. Take
anything you want."
1148,PUMPKIN,1148,"Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll
be all over."
1149,MANAGER,1149,"Everybody just be calm and cooperate
with them and this will be all over
soon!"
1150,PUMPKIN,1150,"Well done, now git your fuckin' ass
on the ground."
1151,PUMPKIN,1151,"Okay people, I'm going to go 'round
and collect your wallets. Don't talk,
just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?"
1152,PUMPKIN,1152,In the bag.
1153,PUMPKIN,1153,What's in that?
1154,JULES,1154,My boss' dirty laundry.
1155,PUMPKIN,1155,You boss makes you do his laundry?
1156,JULES,1156,When he wants it clean.
1157,PUMPKIN,1157,Sounds like a shit job.
1158,JULES,1158,"Funny, I've been thinkin' the same
thing."
1159,PUMPKIN,1159,Open it up.
1160,JULES,1160,'Fraid I can't do that.
1161,PUMPKIN,1161,I didn't hear you.
1162,JULES,1162,"Yes, you did."
1163,HONEY BUNNY,1163,What's goin' on?
1164,PUMPKIN,1164,"Looks like we got a vigilante in our
midst."
1165,HONEY BUNNY,1165,Shoot 'em in the face!
1166,JULES,1166,"I don't mean to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time I've
had gun pointed at me."
1167,PUMPKIN,1167,"You don't open up that case, it's
gonna be the last."
1168,MANAGER,1168,"Quit causing problems, you'll get us
all killed! Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of here."
1169,JULES,1169,"Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat
man, this ain't any of your goddamn
business!"
1170,PUMPKIN,1170,"I'm countin' to three, and if your
hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna
unload right in your fuckin' face.
Clear? One..."
1171,PUMPKIN,1171,...two... three.
1172,JULES,1172,You win.
1173,JULES,1173,"It's all yours, Ringo."
1174,PUMPKIN,1174,Open it.
1175,HONEY BUNNY,1175,What is it? What is it?
1176,PUMPKIN,1176,Is that what I think it is?
1177,PUMPKIN,1177,It's beautiful.
1178,HONEY BUNNY,1178,"Goddammit, what is it?"
1179,HONEY BUNNY,1179,"Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow
your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!
I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're
gonna fuckin' die bad!"
1180,JULES,1180,"Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,
bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!"
1181,PUMPKIN,1181,"Chill out, honey!"
1182,HONEY BUNNY,1182,Let him go!
1183,JULES,1183,Tell her it's gonna be okay.
1184,PUMPKIN,1184,I'm gonna be okay.
1185,JULES,1185,Promise her.
1186,PUMPKIN,1186,I promise.
1187,JULES,1187,Tell her to chill.
1188,PUMPKIN,1188,Just chill out.
1189,JULES,1189,What's her name?
1190,PUMPKIN,1190,Yolanda.
1191,JULES,1191,"So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna
do anything stupid, are we?"
1192,YOLANDA,1192,Don't you hurt him.
1193,JULES,1193,"Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're
gonna be like three Fonzies. And
what' Fonzie like?"
1194,JULES,1194,"C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?"
1195,YOLANDA,1195,He's cool?
1196,JULES,1196,"Correct-amundo! And that's what we're
gonna be, we're gonna be cool."
1197,JULES,1197,"Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three
and I want you to let go your gun
and lay your palms flat on the table.
But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?"
1198,JULES,1198,One... two... three.
1199,YOLANDA,1199,"Okay, now let him go!"
1200,JULES,1200,"Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be
cool.  When you yell at me, it makes
me nervous.  When I get nervous, I
get scared. And when motherfuckers
get scared, that's when motherfuckers
get accidentally shot."
1201,YOLANDA,1201,"Just know: you hurt him, you die."
1202,JULES,1202,"That seems to be the situation. Now
I don't want that and you don't want
that and Ringo here don't want that.
So let's see what we can do."
1203,JULES,1203,"Now this is the situation. Normally
both of your asses would be dead as
fuckin' fried chicken. But you
happened to pull this shit while I'm
in a transitional period. I don't
wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
But I'm afraid I can't give you the
case. It don't belong to me. Besides,
I went through too much shit this
morning on account of this case to
just hand it over to your ass."
1204,VINCENT (O.S.),1204,What the fuck's goin' on here?
1205,JULES,1205,"It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't
do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's
cool baby, nothin's changed. We're
still just talkin'."
1206,JULES,1206,Tell her we're still cool.
1207,PUMPKIN,1207,"It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still
cool."
1208,VINCENT,1208,"What the hell's goin' on, Jules?"
1209,JULES,1209,"Nothin' I can't handle. I want you
to just hang back and don't do shit
unless it's absolutely necessary."
1210,VINCENT,1210,Check.
1211,JULES,1211,"Yolanda, how we doin, baby?"
1212,YOLANDA,1212,I gotta go pee! I want to go home.
1213,JULES,1213,"Just hang in there, baby, you're
doing' great, Ringo's proud of you
and so am I.  It's almost over."
1214,JULES,1214,"Now I want you to go in that bag and
find my wallet."
1215,PUMPKIN,1215,Which one is it?
1216,JULES,1216,"It's the one that says Bad
Motherfucker on it."
1217,JULES,1217,"That's my bad motherfucker. Now open
it up and take out the cash. How
much is there?"
1218,PUMPKIN,1218,About fifteen hundred dollars.
1219,JULES,1219,"Put it in your pocket, it's yours.
Now with the rest of them wallets
and the register, that makes this a
pretty successful little score."
1220,VINCENT,1220,"Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on
general principle."
1221,JULES,1221,"You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,
now hang back and shut the fuck up.
Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.
I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.
Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?"
1222,PUMPKIN,1222,What?
1223,JULES,1223,"Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't hafta kill your ass. You
read the Bible?"
1224,PUMPKIN,1224,Not regularly.
1225,JULES,1225,"There's a passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he
is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you."" I been sayin' that shit for
years.  And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really
questioned what it meant. I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
a cap in his ass. But I saw some
shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
the evil man. And I'm the righteous
man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the
shepherd protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness. Or is
could by you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd and it's the
world that's evil and selfish.  I'd
like that. But that shit ain't the
truth. The truth is you're the weak.
And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But
I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to
be a shepherd."
1226,JULES,1226,It's cold.
1227,VINCENT,1227,I think we oughta leave now.
1228,JULES,1228,That's probably a good idea.
