0,MARK,0,"Ladies, please, we're doing
everything we can to handle the
situation. Nothing is more
important to us than the safety of
our shoppers. Now in the
meantime, feel free to check out
some of our wonderful back-to-
school sales. Excuse me for a
minute."
1,MARK,1,Have you seen Ronnie?
2,RECEPTIONIST,2,I haven't seen him all morning.
3,MARK,3,"Ramon, have you seen Ronnie?"
4,JANITOR,4,"No, senor."
5,MARK,5,Where is Ronnie?
6,RONNIE,6,"Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!"
7,STEVIE,7,"Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a
parking lot."
8,RONNIE,8,"Sir, pull over to the sidewalk,
NOW!"
9,HECTOR,9,Leave us alone.
10,STEVIE,10,"Yeah, skating's not a crime, dick."
11,RONNIE,11,"Skateboarding is not allowed on
mall premises. Pull over now!"
12,STEVIE,12,We're not leaving.
13,HECTOR,13,"Yeah, fuck you!"
14,STEVIE,14,What the fuck are you doing?
15,RONNIE,15,"I was driving in reverse and
trying to get you to flip into the
back seat."
16,STEVIE,16,What?
17,RONNIE,17,"That way I could handcuff you
smoothly and take you in. You
know, never mind, just get in the
goddamn golf cart."
18,RONNIE,18,"It seems like we go through this
every day. What's it going to
take for you all to realize that I
won't tolerate this horseplay and
just do whatever you want to and
don't worry about the rules
attitude?"
19,STEVIE,19,"Ronnie, I hear what you're saying
and I just want you to know that
personally, it pains me to see you
all worked up and I just want you
to know that I'm really sorry
because you can't do shit and you
can take your little rules and
stick'em up your ass, you fuckin'
rent-a-cop."
20,HECTOR,20,"Yeah, suck my dick."
21,RONNIE,21,"That's funny, guys. I try to be a
mentor to the youth, but it seems
like you boys have gone straight
past boydom to the land of street-
hardened criminals. I'm left with
no choice. You call me rent-a-
cop, but I call myself the law's
right hand. I see the crime...
and I phone it in. And that's
what I'm getting ready to do right
now."
22,RONNIE,22,"317, this is Ronnie Barnhardt over
at Carolina Mall. Come in, over."
23,WALKIE VOICE (V.O.),23,"This is Officer Douglas, what do
you wish to report? Over."
24,RONNIE,24,"I've got a couple of trespassers
who have been found skateboarding
on mall property. Can you send a
black and white over to take these
boys into processing? Over."
25,WALKIE VOICE (V.O.),25,"Uh... Yeah, Ronnie, we're kind of
busy today. I mean, we got like
three car accidents."
26,RONNIE,26,"What do you mean? I've got these
guys red-handed. I'm gonna need a
car over here pronto. I can't
hold them all day by myself.
Over."
27,WALKIE VOICE (V.O.),27,"Copy. Yeah, like I said, we're
awfully busy right now. I think
you should probably just make'em
promise not to do it again and
threaten to call their parents or
something. That'll get them.
Over."
28,RONNIE,28,"Sir, I don't think you understand,
their parents don't care about
them. This is a 911 from one of
your soldiers. Officer needs
assistance! Over!"
29,WALKIE VOICE (V.O.),29,"Yeah, it's not gonna happen..."
30,RONNIE,30,"So as you can see, the law is just
one little call away. But I'm
gonna choose not to use that
tactic today. I'm gonna do
something that I like to do from
time to time, and that's called
handle shit myself."
31,RONNIE,31,"While I won't have you arrested
today, I am going to suspend each
of you for one week. For those of
you who don't know how this works,
here it is. This is official
documentation. If you step foot
on mall property, it is considered
trespassing. At that point, I
call the police, they come down,
you go directly to jail."
32,RONNIE,32,"You accepted it originally, so it
still counts."
33,NELL,33,"Dear Lord, bless this food that we
eat and purify it with Your
salvation. Also, please keep
Ronnie safe as he works in Your
name to protect the customers and
employees and store owners of the
mall."
34,NELL (CONT'D),34,"And please turn your wrath on any
sinners that try to hurt him and
make them pay by burning in the
eternal flames of hell. In
Christ's name we pray, amen."
35,RONNIE,35,Amen.
36,NELL,36,"So what's on the agenda for you
today?"
37,RONNIE,37,"You know, the usual. Spot crime
before it happens, perform random
acts of bravery, save people from
certain death, yada yada yada."
38,NELL,38,"What's wrong, Ronnie?"
39,RONNIE,39,"Nothing, Nell."
40,NELL,40,"Ronnie, I know that you really
want to be a Police Officer, but
you have to realize that things
work out the way they're meant to."
41,RONNIE,41,"I know. I'm okay, Nell. Thanks,
but really, I mean, I'm on the
front lines right now. I'm livin'
it."
42,NELL,42,"Your job is definitely more
exciting than mine."
43,RONNIE,43,"Of course it is, but at least you
don't have to wrestle with the
demons at night. I better get
going."
44,NELL,44,"I'll see you after work, sweetie."
45,RONNIE,45,"Not at work, Nell. We have to
keep up appearances, we talked
about this. And don't call me
sweetie."
46,NELL,46,"I'm sorry. I'll see you after
work, Officer Barnhardt."
47,RONNIE,47,"'Bye, Nell."
48,RONNIE,48,"Slow it down. Watch your speed
there. This ain't a race. Hey,
second time, slow it down."
49,MARK,49,I've been looking all over for you.
50,RONNIE,50,"I haven't been hiding, but some
things that I have to do are
better to keep hidden from you and
'official' eyes. Trust me, it's
best all around if there are no
bodies to clean up."
51,MARK,51,"So you may or may not have heard,
but this morning, several women
were assaulted just outside the
front doors by a crazy Pervert."
52,RONNIE,52,For the love of God.
53,MARK,53,"I know, it's horrible."
54,RONNIE,54,"You want me to phone this one in
to the police?"
55,MARK,55,"Not just yet. See if we call the
police, they'll be a big scandal
and something like that could kill
what little traffic we have at
this mall. What I need you to do
is watch out for this Pervert and
if you see him, try to stop him or
quietly phone it in so we can
handle this discreetly."
56,RONNIE,56,"Hold on, Mark. Let me make sure I
understand you. You're telling me
to deny my primary objective of
Observing and Reporting crime and
at the same time, you're giving me
authorization to handle this case
on my own."
57,MARK,57,"I'm just saying keep an eye out
and keep quiet."
58,RONNIE,58,"So basically, I'm in charge of
this whole investigation."
59,MARK,59,There's no investigation.
60,RONNIE,60,"Not yet. Okay, Mark, I'll do it,
but I'm gonna need a few things
first."
61,MARK,61,You can't carry a gun.
62,RONNIE,62,"Well, I'm gonna need a new title.
Something to instill fear in the
criminal mind. How about Director
of Mall Intelligence?"
63,MARK,63,Head of Mall Security.
64,RONNIE,64,That's perfect.
65,MARK,65,And it doesn't come with a raise.
66,RONNIE,66,Got it.
67,MARK,67,"And the new title stays between
us."
68,RONNIE,68,"Understood. Thank you for this
opportunity, Mark. I won't let
you down."
69,FEMALE REPORTER,69,"Excuse me, sir, but we would like
to ask you a few questions."
70,RONNIE,70,"I'm sorry, but I can't answer
anything."
71,FEMALE REPORTER,71,"We heard a report that an
unidentified man was spotted
earlier today exposing himself to
several women. Do you care to
comment?"
72,RONNIE,72,"I'm not allowed to comment on that
situation."
73,FEMALE REPORTER,73,So you admit there is a situation.
74,RONNIE,74,"I'm trained to resist torture for
up to 72 hours, you really expect
me to break now? Get real, lady."
75,FEMALE REPORTER,75,"We're wasting our time here.
Let's go find some police to
interview."
76,RONNIE,76,Good luck.
77,FEMALE REPORTER,77,What's that supposed to mean?
78,RONNIE,78,"It just means you won't find any
police."
79,FEMALE REPORTER,79,"Are you telling me the police
haven't even been called!"
80,RONNIE,80,"Ewww, alert the media."
81,FEMALE REPORTER,81,"Jesus, well who'd they leave in
charge, you?"
82,FEMALE REPORTER,82,"Yeah, right. Why would they leave
you in charge?"
83,RONNIE,83,"First of all, if there was a
situation to be handled, I don't
see why you find it so goddamn
ridiculous that I would be in
charge."
84,FEMALE REPORTER,84,"Look, there is no way you're in
charge of this investigation."
85,RONNIE,85,"Well for your information, I'm in
charge of this whole fucking
operation."
86,RONNIE (CONT'D),86,"I don't give a goddamn if you
believe me or not, Ms. Hot Fuckin'
SHIT news lady. I'm the first
line of defense against this
pervert. As the law's right hand,
I'm here so that people like you
can live in your own little happy
world and think places like this
mall are safe and fun. I'm the
defender of this war zone. Just
me and my goddamn flashlight."
87,SADDAMN,87,"You motherfucker, you put a boot
on my car!"
88,RONNIE,88,"I warned you about parking in the
fire lane, Saddamn!"
89,SADDAMN,89,"Fuck you, Ronnie! Take that
goddamn boot off of my car."
90,VOICE),90,Step away now!
91,SADDAMN,91,"I pay good money to this mall.
Don't tell me where to park!"
92,RONNIE,92,"Sir, I will be forced to take
action if you do not step back!"
93,SADDAMN,93,I'm gonna kill you!
94,RONNIE,94,"As I was saying, the pervert
situation here is real bleak. For
all you people out there thinking
of coming to the mall, please for
your own safety, stay away."
95,SADDAMN,95,I can't believe you tased me.
96,RONNIE,96,"That's right and I've got another
one waiting right here for you."
97,RONNIE,97,"Hey, Brandi."
98,RONNIE,98,"That color looks great on your
skin. Not just that color, but
I've noticed that all make-up
looks really good on you.
Especially the blue around your
eyes. I bet it drives the men
crazy."
99,RONNIE,99,"It's okay.   I can say that because
I'm taken."
100,BRANDI,100,"What do you want, Ronnie?"
101,RONNIE,101,"I'm here on official business.
See, I don't know if you know
this, but I have recently been
made Head of Mall Security. Did
you hear about that?"
102,BRANDI,102,No.
103,RONNIE,103,"Well, I'm sure you will. It's
actually pretty huge news. But
the reason I stopped by is to tell
you that it looks like we've got a
pervert on the loose. A real live
psychopath who gains sexual
gratification by exposing himself
to ladies such as yourself. I
just want to warn you to be
careful when coming and going to
work."
104,BRANDI,104,"Okay, got it."
105,RONNIE,105,"And you may not want to wear any
of those skirts that you like to
wear."
106,BRANDI,106,What skirts?
107,RONNIE,107,"You know what skirts. Something
like that could set him off. And
for that matter, you better not
wear any of those little low-cut
top things either, okay?
Especially with those black bras
because, you can really see them
in the light. Perverts really
tend to notice stuff like that.
Okay, see you later."
108,RONNIE,108,"Dennis, man, I'm glad we've got a
minute to talk. There's no easy
way to say this so I'm just going
to come right out with it. Mark
offered me the position of Head of
Mall Security. I know this isn't
easy for you to hear seeing as
you've been here longer than me.
But I want you to know that you're
my best friend and I'm only going
to accept the job if you're okay
with that."
109,RONNIE,109,"Well, you should know I've already
accepted and it's too late to turn
it down now. Every ship needs a
captain. So you were passed over.
Who gives a shit? Dennis, in
time, you'll come to accept
answering to me. Remember, there
aren't any leaders in friendship.
We cool?"
110,RONNIE,110,"Hey, you want to go and grab a
beer or something?"
111,RONNIE,111,"Yeah, you're right. You're
probably in no mood to party after
that news. Well, try not to take
it too hard. See you later,
buddy."
112,MOM,112,"You think you're ready for a shot
at the title, motherfucker?!"
113,RONNIE,113,"I'm ready, Mom."
114,MOM,114,Ding ding.
115,RONNIE,115,Ow!
116,MOM,116,"What's wrong, baby?    Is your pussy
hurting?"
117,RONNIE,117,Fuck you!
118,MOM,118,Ah!
119,RONNIE,119,You give?
120,MOM,120,Fuck you!
121,MOM,121,Ow!
122,RONNIE,122,"You move with me, you go down.
You move against me and your arm
breaks."
123,MOM,123,I give!
124,RONNIE,124,What's that?
125,MOM,125,"I give!   Let me go, goddamn it."
126,MOM,126,"I can't believe you got that lucky
shit on me."
127,RONNIE,127,Luck has nothing to do with it.
128,MOM,128,You almost broke my arm.
129,RONNIE,129,"I'm sorry, Mom. Are you okay?"
130,MOM,130,Not really.
131,RONNIE (V.O.),131,"Yeah, well for your information,
I'm in charge of this whole BEEP
operation. I don't give a BEEP if
you believe me or not, Ms. Hot
BEEP BEEP news lady. Do you see
anybody else? BEEP no you don't.
As the law's right hand, I'm the
first line of defense against this
pervert. I'm here so that people
like you can live in your own
little happy world and think
places like this mall are safe and
fun. I'm the defender of this war
zone. Just me and my BEEP
flashlight."
132,FEMALE REPORTER (V.O.),132,"No comment as to why steps are not
being taken, but this Security
Guard feels like he is the only
one doing anything to protect the
people who visit Carolina Mall
from the suspect. For all of us,
I hope this isn't the case. Back
to you, Lindsay."
133,MOM,133,"I'm so proud of you, Ronnie."
134,RONNIE,134,Do you think I did good?
135,MOM,135,Hell yes.   You were great.
136,RONNIE,136,"Ah, you're just drunk."
137,MOM,137,"Nah, you did good."
138,RONNIE,138,"Yeah, I usually don't come out to
the forefront like that."
139,RONNIE (CONT'D),139,"My official orders are Observe and
Report, but when Mark put me in
charge of mall security, something
inside of me changed. It's what
I've always wanted. Things
haven't always worked out, with
the whole... well, you know. But
this gives me faith that I can do
something great. This is my call
to duty and I'm going to answer.
I'm going to bust this fucking
pervert. I swear it on everything
I am. Anyway, I better get to
sleep. I got a big day tomorrow.
Good night, Mom."
140,RONNIE (CONT'D),140,Mom?
141,RONNIE,141,You working the door here?
142,BOUNCER,142,"That's what they tell me. They
needed to hire a little security
here in case the drunks get out of
line or whatever."
143,RONNIE,143,"Kind of funny they thought they
needed more security here. Ha.
You do realize that if anyone gets
out of hand, you need to call me
to handle the situation."
144,BOUNCER,144,"I work for O'Charley's, not for
the mall."
145,RONNIE,145,"Granted, but you realize that my
jurisdiction supersedes any and
all other forms of security when
under the roof of Carolina Mall?"
146,BOUNCER,146,"You know, I thought about getting
a job as a Mall Security."
147,RONNIE,147,You did?
148,BOUNCER,148,"Yeah, man. I mean, I'm kind of on
extended vacation from college and
it's just like, I don't want to do
shit, you know what I mean? My
parents said I have to work if I
want to live at home, but I just
don't feel like doing anything.
This was the easiest job I could
find, I mean, what the hell could
be hard about being a bouncer in a
mall restaurant? But now that I
think about it, Mall Security
could be easier than this."
149,RONNIE,149,"My young friend, you are sorely
mistaken. Do you know how much
stuff I'm in charge of?"
150,BOUNCER,150,No.
151,RONNIE,151,"A shitload. That's not even
counting the parking lot."
152,BOUNCER,152,"Really? I thought you just kind
of chilled out and called stuff
into the police."
153,RONNIE,153,"No way, that's about like 75,
maybe 82 percent of it. There's
so much other stuff."
154,BOUNCER,154,Like what?
155,RONNIE,155,"Two words, Friday Night."
156,BOUNCER,156,What about it?
157,RONNIE,157,"It's crazy, let's just leave it at
that."
158,BOUNCER,158,Okay.
159,RONNIE,159,"Listen. I like you, but I don't
like the fact that you're
masquerading as an official in the
security world. If you're serious
about a career in the security
world, then perhaps I could look
into getting you a job on my
staff?"
160,BOUNCER,160,Oh yeah?
161,RONNIE,161,"Part of my job is reaching out to
troubled youths such as yourself.
It's who I am."
162,BOUNCER,162,"Does it pay more than $6.50 an
hour?"
163,BOUNCER,163,Seven even.
164,BOUNCER,164,"I'd say that's more than I'm
making now."
165,RONNIE,165,"Hold on, this job involves a
probationary period. You have to
prove yourself worthy. We can't
just hire any old Tom, Dick, or
Harry just because they want to
carry a flashlight."
166,BOUNCER,166,What do I have to do?
167,RONNIE,167,"You have to complete a term as
deputy. You will answer directly
to me. Your job will be to come
and find me if you see any
trouble. If this works out, then
I will phone the crime into the
police. Now, this will train your
eyes to spot various criminal
activity. Once you have completed
your training, you will be awarded
an official position on my
security staff where you will have
the duty of actually phoning in
crimes to the police yourself."
168,BOUNCER,168,"So basically, I just do what I'm
doing now and then you'll get me a
job?"
169,RONNIE,169,For starters.
170,BOUNCER,170,"How long does this mentorship
last?"
171,RONNIE,171,"Until Mark lets me hire another
guy."
172,BOUNCER,172,Can I smoke while I work?
173,RONNIE,173,"Yes, you can."
174,BOUNCER,174,Sign me up.
175,RONNIE,175,"You keep that attitude up and
you'll have no problem making the
squad."
176,BOUNCER,176,What's this?
177,RONNIE,177,"It's a flashlight. Get to know
it. It's your new best friend.
Until you get your giant
flashlight. Then, that will be
your new best friend."
178,RONNIE,178,"Okay, look alive, soldier. Deputy
time starts now. No more slacker
attitude for you."
179,RONNIE,179,"You know, I remember when I got my
first flashlight..."
180,MARK,180,"Alright, people, she's doing good.
We're just gonna get her down to
my office and everything's going
to be fine, so the best thing for
you employees to do is just get on
back to your stations and you
customers can go ahead and enjoy
the back to school savings here at
Carolina Mall."
181,BRANDI,181,"It was horrible! Oh, my God, the
thought of that disgusting -- I
think I'm going to be sick."
182,BRUCE,182,"Just let it out, baby.   He should
be ashamed!"
183,BRANDI,183,"I just keep playing it over and
over again in my head."
184,MARK,184,"Brandi, please, Dennis has called
the police and let's just take
this down to my office."
185,DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER,185,What's going on?
186,BRUCE,186,"A Pervert attacked Brandi is
what's going on!"
187,DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER,187,"Are you okay, Brandi?"
188,BRANDI,188,"Physically, yes. But
psychologically, no!"
189,DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER,189,Did you call the cops?
190,MARK,190,They're on the way.
191,DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER,191,"Yeah, we got to get her the fuck
out of here. Everybody's standing
around and nobody's shopping.
This is bad for business."
192,MARK,192,"I'm trying, but she just keeps
crying."
193,RONNIE,193,"Brandi! I came as soon as I
heard. Jesus, are you alright?"
194,BRANDI,194,"I'm fine, Ronnie."
195,MARK,195,"She's fine, Ronnie."
196,RONNIE,196,"This is one of the most heinous
things I've seen. Jesus, I tried
to tell you about the skirts.
It's not your fault, you little
fighter you. Ronnie's not mad,
okay?"
197,MARK,197,"Ronnie, can you get her down to my
office so the Police can talk to
her in private when they arrive."
198,RONNIE,198,Rogers.
199,BRANDI,199,"I can't walk right now.   I feel
like I'm in shock."
200,RONNIE,200,Don't worry.   I'll carry you.
201,MARK,201,"Oh, fucking Jesus."
202,DETECTIVE HARRISON,202,"Your secretary told me to come on
in. I'm Detective Harrison,
Cabarrus County Police."
203,MARK,203,"Mark Talbert, I manage the mall.
This is Brandi, she's the one who
saw the deviant."
204,DETECTIVE HARRISON,204,"Hello, Brandi.     Are you doing
okay?"
205,BRANDI,205,I'm really shaken up.
206,DETECTIVE HARRISON,206,"Yes, ma'am, I'm sure you are after
all you've been through, but I'm
here to tell you that we're going
to work together to make sure we
catch the person who did this."
207,RONNIE,207,"My name is Ronnie Barnhardt, chief
inspector on the case and head of
Mall Security here at Carolina
Mall and this is my lieutenant,
Dennis. From one law enforcement
officer to another, I just want to
welcome you and say that we will
do whatever it takes to coordinate
with your department in order to
bring this assailant to justice."
208,DETECTIVE HARRISON,208,Great.
209,(back to Brandi),209,"Okay, Brandi. Did you get a look
at the suspect?"
210,BRANDI,210,"Yes, I did."
211,RONNIE,211,Did you get a blood sample?
212,BRANDI,212,No.
213,RONNIE,213,"That's a shame. Would have been
useful."
214,MARK,214,"Go ahead, Detective."
215,DETECTIVE HARRISON,215,"Thank you. Brandi, can you
remember anything specifically?
What color was his hair? Was he
tall or short?"
216,BRANDI,216,"He was tall and skinny and he had
brown hair and it was real greasy."
217,DETECTIVE HARRISON,217,Was his hair long or short?
218,BRANDI,218,"It was long about to his
shoulders."
219,DETECTIVE HARRISON,219,Did he say anything?
220,BRANDI,220,"No, he just stood there and you
know, touched himself."
221,DETECTIVE HARRISON,221,What was he wearing?
222,BRANDI,222,Just a brown trench coat.
223,RONNIE,223,This is what I got so far.
224,RONNIE,224,What's yours look like?
225,DETECTIVE HARRISON,225,I just wrote a description.
226,RONNIE,226,Oh.
227,DETECTIVE HARRISON,227,"Okay, Brandi, I think that's good
for now. I think the best thing
at this point is to just follow up
with the other ladies who saw the
perpetrator yesterday and see if
they remember anything."
228,BRANDI,228,What if he comes back?
229,DETECTIVE HARRISON,229,"That's highly unlikely. These
incidents are usually random and
unpredictable. I'm sure you'll be
safe."
230,RONNIE,230,"I'm afraid I'm going to have to
disagree with you there,
Detective. By my math, it seems
pretty clear that Brandi's been
targeted."
231,DETECTIVE HARRISON,231,"Targeted? What gives you that
impression?"
232,RONNIE,232,"Well, how about the fact that she
was the first employee to get
assaulted? Not to mention the
fact that she is the prettiest
girl who works at this mall. To
me it seems obvious that this is
some sort of methodical villain
that plans on returning to finish
what he started by murdering
Brandi."
233,BRANDI,233,Is that going to happen?!
234,DETECTIVE HARRISON,234,That's not going to happen.
235,DETECTIVE HARRISON,235,"Well don't worry. I'm on the case
and I'm going to do everything in
my power to bring this guy down."
236,RONNIE,236,"That's right, Brandi, you've got
the best team in law enforcement
working for you."
237,DETECTIVE HARRISON,237,"Look, I've got to get going.
Here's my card. I'll even write
my home phone number on the back,
just in the event you need to get
a hold of me."
238,DETECTIVE HARRISON,238,"Give me a call when you aren't
working and I'll have you come to
the station to look through some
mug shots."
239,DETECTIVE HARRISON,239,Don't worry okay.
240,BRANDI,240,I feel a lot better now.
241,DETECTIVE HARRISON,241,What?
242,RONNIE,242,"I'll take one of those cards as
well."
243,DETECTIVE HARRISON,243,"Oh, okay."
244,RONNIE,244,"Go ahead and write your home phone
on there as well in case I need to
get a hold of you."
245,DETECTIVE HARRISON,245,"You can just leave a message at
the station. I check my messages
constantly."
246,RONNIE,246,"Sorry, but I'm gonna need those
digits. If we're gonna solve this
crime we need to constantly be in
communication with each other and
have an open door policy with
intelligence. Brandi, let me see
that card."
247,RONNIE,247,"Cool, I'll call you later with an
update."
248,DETECTIVE HARRISON,248,Don't do that.
249,RONNIE,249,"It's no problem at all. We're
brothers of the badge. This is
what we do for each other."
250,RONNIE,250,"Seems like a good guy. A little
green, but still solid."
251,NELL,251,What are you doing?
252,RONNIE,252,Just putting these posters up.
253,NELL,253,"You've been so obsessed with
catching this pervert I've barely
seen you."
254,RONNIE,254,"That's what it's like when you
date the Head of Mall Security.
The downside is we don't get to
see each other as much, but the
upside is you get to brag to all
your friends."
255,NELL,255,"Well, are you ready to go?"
256,RONNIE,256,"Sure, let's take off."
257,NELL,257,"What are you doing, Ronnie?"
258,RONNIE,258,"Come on, let me get some of those
big bazoombas."
259,NELL,259,"Ronnie, no."
260,RONNIE,260,"Goddamn it, are we ever gonna do
it?"
261,NELL,261,You know we talked about this.
262,RONNIE,262,"We did, it's just, well, I'm tired
of just doing what we do. I'm
ready for something bigger. Like
sex or just maybe using a finger
on you --"
263,NELL,263,"Ronnie, you know I'm saving myself
for marriage. I thought you were
okay with that."
264,RONNIE,264,"Well, I used to be, it's just. I
don't know. What's so great about
being a 27-year-old virgin?"
265,RONNIE,265,"Nell, I'm sorry. Don't go away
like this."
266,NELL,266,I thought you loved my purity.
267,RONNIE,267,"I do.   I really do. I'm sorry,
Nell."
268,NELL,268,"It's okay.   I should leave anyway,
it's late."
269,RONNIE,269,"I'll stop by for breakfast
tomorrow."
270,NELL,270,See ya tomorrow.
271,RONNIE,271,"Mom, wake up.    Let's go to bed."
272,RONNIE,272,Oh shit.
273,RONNIE,273,"Good to see you, brother. Looks
like the old team is getting
together to crack one more case."
274,RONNIE,274,I'm ready to go to war with you.
275,DETECTIVE HARRISON,275,"Thanks for waking me up this
morning, Ronnie."
276,RONNIE,276,"I've already checked the Security
tapes. They didn't catch a thing.
Someone must have broken in here
and turned them off."
277,DETECTIVE HARRISON,277,"My team just checked all the doors
and there are no signs of forced
entry. I've also checked out the
crime scene, but we didn't see any
fingerprints on the glass. The
suspect was probably wearing
gloves."
278,MARK,278,"That doesn't sound good.   How did
they do it?"
279,RONNIE,279,Laser technology.
280,DETECTIVE HARRISON,280,"My guess it was an inside job.
Probably someone who has access to
keys like a janitor or a security
guard."
281,RONNIE,281,"Detective Harrison, can I ask you
how long you've been a detective
for?"
282,DETECTIVE HARRISON,282,"I'm almost at the end of my first
year."
283,RONNIE,283,"Just as I thought, a rookie."
284,DETECTIVE HARRISON,284,"I've been a police officer for
several years."
285,RONNIE,285,"Yeah, you're a rookie, okay. It's
fine, you'll learn with
experience. And when you do,
you'll discover that rule #1 of
law enforcement is that you don't
ever turn on a fellow officer.
Now, I know you would never
actually accuse somebody on my
Security Force of committing this
act of lawlessness."
286,DETECTIVE HARRISON,286,"Whoever did this would have to had
keys to the Security Room so they
could shut off the camera."
287,RONNIE,287,"Look, my record speaks for itself
and as for Dennis, well I can
certainly vouch for him. Dennis
is one of the finest men I know,
so just take my word, you're
barking up the wrong tree. Now,
let's put this little squabble
behind us and get back to busting
the guys that robbed this mall."
288,DETECTIVE HARRISON,288,"Ronnie, nobody is accusing
anybody, but I would like to stick
around for a while and interview
some of the employees."
289,MARK,289,"Okay, but all I ask is that you do
it quietly, so that the hoopla is
kept to a minimum."
290,DETECTIVE HARRISON,290,I understand.
291,RONNIE,291,"I understand too, sir."
292,MARK,292,"Ronnie, you are to leave Detective
Harrison alone and let him handle
the investigation."
293,RONNIE,293,"No can do, Mark. When you
appointed me Head of Mall
Security, I swore an oath to
protect this mall and aid in
bringing crime to its knees."
294,MARK,294,You didn't swear an oath.
295,RONNIE,295,To myself I did.
296,DETECTIVE HARRISON,296,"Ronnie, on these types of
investigations, it's usually not a
good idea to have too many cooks
in the kitchen."
297,RONNIE,297,"There's only one cook. I'm a
chef. A cook and chef, together,
serving up justice."
298,DETECTIVE HARRISON,298,I'm gonna do this alone.
299,RONNIE,299,Hot plates of justice.
300,RONNIE,300,"Come on, rookie. Let me show you
the lay of the land."
301,RONNIE,301,"Okay, Dennis. I've gotta hang
with Detective Harrison."
302,RONNIE (CONT'D),302,"What I need for you to understand
is that just because Detective
Harrison is here, doesn't mean
that you and me are no longer best
friends. Sure, Harrison would be
cool to hang out with. He carries
a badge and a gun. He probably
owns a boat. Over time, we'll
probably become really close like
brothers, but for right now,
you're still number one. Now, I
must leave you behind because duty
calls, so... chin up. Radio if
you need anything."
303,DETECTIVE HARRISON,303,"So, have you seen any suspicious
people hanging around the mall?
Anybody who might have been casing
the stores?"
304,SADDAMN,304,"Nah, man.   I ain't seen nothing."
305,DETECTIVE HARRISON,305,"Okay, well if you can think of
anything, here's my card."
306,RONNIE,306,"My turn, Rookie."
307,DETECTIVE HARRISON,307,"What are you doing, Ronnie?"
308,RONNIE,308,"Solving the whole case right
before your eyes."
309,DETECTIVE HARRISON,309,"Ronnie, this is official police
business."
310,RONNIE,310,"Hello, Saddamn."
311,SADDAMN,311,"What the fuck you want, Ronnie?"
312,RONNIE,312,"I want your ass to face the music
is what I want."
313,SADDAMN,313,"Don't come any further, bitch.
The restraining order says 20 feet
so just back the fuck up."
314,DETECTIVE HARRISON,314,"Ronnie, I appreciate your
enthusiasm, but just let me handle
this."
315,DETECTIVE HARRISON,315,"Have a good day, sir."
316,RONNIE,316,"So you're just gonna let him slip
right through your fingers?"
317,DETECTIVE HARRISON,317,"I have no reason to make him a
suspect."
318,RONNIE,318,"No reason? Look at him. There's
every reason in the goddamn book."
319,SADDAMN,319,"Why are you saying that, man?"
320,RONNIE,320,"I think it's obvious, Saddamn."
321,SADDAMN,321,"That's fucked up. You're racist,
man."
322,RONNIE,322,You're not even black.
323,DETECTIVE HARRISON,323,"Ronnie, stop. We're finished
here. Now if you're going to tag
along, I'm gonna need you to just
stay back; are we clear?"
324,RONNIE,324,"Sure, sorry.   We're crystal."
325,SADDAMN,325,"What's up, girl, you got a
boyfriend? Free cell phones with
a month trial and I throw in my
phone number for free."
326,DETECTIVE HARRISON,326,"Did you let anybody borrow your
keys?"
327,JANITOR,327,"No, senor."
328,DETECTIVE HARRISON,328,Have you seen anything suspicious?
329,JANITOR,329,"No, senor."
330,DETECTIVE HARRISON,330,"Okay, sir.   Thank you for your
time."
331,RONNIE,331,"Alright, I believe I can be of
some assistance here."
332,DETECTIVE HARRISON,332,"Ronnie, we talked about this."
333,RONNIE,333,This is a special circumstance.
334,DETECTIVE HARRISON,334,What special circumstance?
335,RONNIE,335,"Communication skills, watch and
learn."
336,RONNIE,336,Que pasa?
337,JANITOR,337,"Long drawn out conversation in
Spanish?"
338,RONNIE,338,Como?
339,JANITOR,339,More Spanish dialogue.
340,RONNIE,340,Si.
341,RONNIE,341,"Yeah, this guy definitely did it."
342,DETECTIVE HARRISON,342,What did he say?
343,RONNIE,343,"I don't know, I don't speak
Spanish, but judging from his
tonal inflections, it's safe to
say that he's hiding something.
The only question is where."
344,RONNIE,344,"Okay, Ramon, I'm giving you one
chance and one chance only to come
clean. Or else Detective Harrison
is going to come over to your
house and deport your whole family
back to Mexico."
345,DETECTIVE HARRISON,345,"No, I'm not."
346,RONNIE,346,"Good cop, bad cop, just play
along."
347,RONNIE,347,Where are you hiding the jewels?
348,JANITOR,348,No se.
349,RONNIE,349,"Alright, you're gonna make me be
the bad guy here? Well, that's a
role I'm comfortable playing.
Let's just see what you're hiding."
350,DETECTIVE HARRISON,350,"Ronnie, that's enough."
351,RONNIE,351,"Think you're pretty slick, don't
you? Guess what? I'm pretty
slick too."
352,RONNIE,352,"Alright, you're free -- Wait a
minute."
353,RONNIE,353,"Okay, my mistake. Sir, you're
free to go. Uh, you might want to
have someone clean this up which
in this case is you, so, uh, chop-
chop. Wouldn't want anyone to
slip on this mess."
354,HOT CLERK,354,"Hello, can I help you?"
355,DETECTIVE HARRISON,355,"I'm Detective Harrison with the
Cabarrus County Police."
356,RONNIE,356,"And I'm Ronnie Barnhardt, head of
Mall Security."
357,DETECTIVE HARRISON,357,"Okay, seriously, would you back
the fuck off?! I'm trying to do
my job and you're fucking it up."
358,RONNIE,358,"Come on, we're working here."
359,DETECTIVE HARRISON,359,I'm working!
360,DETECTIVE HARRISON,360,"Sorry. Hi. I'm doing a check
with all the mall employees to see
if anybody has any information on
the robbery that took place here
last night?"
361,HOT CLERK,361,"I'm sorry, but I haven't noticed
anything out of ordinary."
362,SEXY WORKER,362,"Tracy, do you think my boyfriend
would like these?"
363,DETECTIVE HARRISON,363,"That's fine, thanks for the help."
364,RONNIE,364,"You're gonna let them distract you
with a little bit of panty
showing.    You have got a lot to
learn, my friend."
365,(to the Hot Clerk),365,"Who are you protecting, toots?"
366,HOT CLERK,366,What are you talking about?
367,RONNIE,367,"Look, I'm sure you and your little
friend have made a real lifestyle
for yourselves here. It's
probably easy for you to blind
most men with your beauty, but I'm
not most men. I can see through
the sexuality to the truth.
Jewelry, gold, diamonds, you don't
really expect me to think that a
man wants that crap. I'm putting
you on my list of top suspects. I
don't think you did the crime, but
I do think you are an accomplice."
368,DETECTIVE HARRISON,368,"I'm sorry, ma'am. He's not with
me. Here's my card. If you think
of anything, just give me a call."
369,RONNIE,369,You should be ashamed of yourself.
370,RONNIE,370,Is that pot I smell?
371,DETECTIVE HARRISON,371,"Shut up, Ronnie!"
372,SALESMAN,372,It's sage.
373,RONNIE,373,"Whatever, hippy. If I find you
doing drugs or killing cats or
whatever you devil worshippers do,
I'll come back here and bust you.
I swear to God."
374,DETECTIVE HARRISON,374,"Get the hell out, Ronnie. I'm
here to ask questions about the
robbery."
375,RONNIE,375,"Just forget that, we're on to
something bigger here."
376,SALESMAN),376,Tell me more about this 'sage.'
377,RONNIE,377,"Now, maybe I'm crazy or maybe I'm
the smartest man alive, but it
seems kind of convenient to me
that you sell hammers like this
one that could easily be used to
smash a glass case in, oh say, a
jewelry store."
378,SEARS MANAGER,378,"Couldn't you smash the glass with
anything?"
379,RONNIE,379,"You really think you're gonna talk
your way out of this one?"
380,RONNIE,380,"You guys should have been there
today. We were just solving shit
left and right. I mean, that's
what this job is supposed to be
like. Busting loiterers and kids
who steal pennies from the
fountain has its rewards, but
really getting in there and
closing cases is where it's at.
It's rewarding too because at the
end of the day, you know you've
done something good for the world."
381,BOUNCER,381,"What are we doing here, Ronnie? I
thought you said they were giving
away free Chick-fil-A sandwiches."
382,RONNIE,382,Well -- What is your name anyway?
383,BOUNCER,383,Charles.
384,RONNIE,384,"Well, my young apprentice. I
called you here today because as
Head of Mall Security, I have
decided that it's time to take
protection to the next level. In
other words, I alone cannot combat
this recent crime wave. In order
to help me in my personal journey,
I have decided to divide up the
tasks between my soldiers. So,
for now on, Dennis, my right-hand
man, you will be in charge of
solving the case of who is robbing
the mall. Little Chucky, you will
be on the case of the Pervert.
You are both to collect data and
provide it to me. I will analyze
the data, draw conclusions, and
solve these crimes as well as
coordinate and strategize with
various law enforcement agencies."
385,BOUNCER,385,"Since we're going to be doing a
lot of the work and you're going
to be solving the crimes, do we at
least get paid?"
386,RONNIE,386,"You can't measure honor in dollars
and cents."
387,BOUNCER,387,"Is that your girlfriend or
something, Ronnie?"
388,RONNIE,388,"Who me? Nah, man. Why?     What do
you think of her?"
389,BOUNCER,389,"She's not my type, but that's just
me."
390,RONNIE,390,"Yeah, but, you don't think she's
kind of hot?"
391,BOUNCER,391,"Are you blind? Give me a break.
Wait, are you sure she's not your
girlfriend?"
392,RONNIE,392,"Fuck no. There's no way I'd date
that... person who's obviously not
hot."
393,RONNIE,393,"Anyway, our new unit will operate
under the name, 'Special Elite
Task Force.' You will answer
directly to me and no one else.
Now, let's all put our hands in
the middle and do a unifying
cheer."
394,BOUNCER,394,"You're gonna hook me up with a
job, right?"
395,RONNIE,395,Seven even.   I promise.
396,RONNIE,396,"One, two, three, TASK FORCE!"
397,RONNIE,397,"Okay, so now I say we all take a
celebratory trip to Sears because,
as we all know, today is half-
price day on all automotive parts
for mall employees."
398,BRANDI,398,Sorry to interrupt.
399,RONNIE,399,"It's no interruption.   What are
you still doing here?"
400,BRANDI,400,"I had to do inventory tonight.
Bruce took off early so I'm the
last one. Hey, I was wondering if
you would mind walking me to my
car. You know, just in case that
freak with the dick is out there
someplace."
401,RONNIE,401,It would be my honor.
402,BRANDI,402,"Alright, thanks for the ride."
403,RONNIE,403,"Just doing my job with a little
something extra especially for
you."
404,BRANDI,404,See ya tomorrow.
405,RONNIE,405,"Brandi, um... I was just thinking,
would you like to go to dinner
this weekend?"
406,BRANDI,406,"How come every time somebody does
something nice for me, they act
like I owe them a blow job?"
407,RONNIE,407,"Look, it's not like that. I've
got a girlfriend... who doesn't
work in this mall."
408,BRANDI,408,"Ronnie, I got to be honest with
you, you're not really my type."
409,RONNIE,409,"Just out of curiosity, what is
your type?"
410,BRANDI,410,"Rich guys.    Or guys who are really
hot."
411,RONNIE,411,"Yeah, I guess that's not me."
412,BRANDI,412,"I'll go out to dinner with you on
one condition."
413,RONNIE,413,What's that?
414,BRANDI,414,"This is not a date. Do you
understand? We're going to
dinner, but we are not going on a
date."
415,RONNIE,415,Done.
416,BRANDI,416,"And you can never tell anybody we
went out."
417,RONNIE,417,My lips are sealed.
418,BRANDI,418,"You pay for dinner, right?   And as
many drinks as I want."
419,RONNIE,419,You may drink your fill.
420,BRANDI,420,"And you have to drive me to my car
every night after work for the
next six months."
421,RONNIE,421,You got it.
422,BRANDI,422,"And my car is low on gas, so I
need some money to fill it up."
423,RONNIE,423,Is $20 enough?
424,BRANDI,424,"Nah, fifty."
425,BRANDI,425,"Okay, you can pick me up after
work on Saturday. Dinner and
that's it. Don't try to kiss me
because I'll smack the shit out of
you. It's not a date."
426,RONNIE,426,Got it.   Not a date.
427,BRANDI,427,Thanks for the ride.
428,RONNIE,428,"Hey, Brandi."
429,BRANDI,429,What?
430,RONNIE,430,I lied.   It is a date.
431,STEVIE,431,Our suspension is over.
432,RONNIE,432,"I'm not here for that.    I need to
talk to you."
433,BODYGUARD,433,"Anything you want to say to
Stevie, you can say to me,
motherfucker!"
434,RONNIE,434,Who the fuck are you?
435,STEVIE,435,"This is my cousin, Roy.      He's a
boxer."
436,BODYGUARD,436,"You got a fuckin' problem, bitch?!"
437,BODYGUARD,437,My eyes!
438,STEVIE,438,"Jesus, Ronnie, what the fuck are
you doing?"
439,RONNIE,439,I need a favor.
440,STEVIE,440,I'm listening.
441,RONNIE,441,"As you know, we've had a lot of
crime around here lately. Between
the Flasher and all the break-ins,
I've decided to go to the streets.
Frankly, I'm looking for a stool
pigeon and you're just the right
person."
442,STEVIE,442,Why would I want to help you?
443,RONNIE,443,"I could make it worth your while.
You like skating at the mall. I
could allow you to skate here
whenever you wanted. In exchange,
you keep your eyes peeled and
provide me with any information
you come across as to the identity
of the perpetrators."
444,STEVIE,444,"Sorry, dude, but I'm no snitch.
Go find somebody else to do your
dirty work."
445,RONNIE,445,"Well, let me put it another way.
If you don't help me, I'm gonna
spread your little butt cheeks and
stick this flashlight up your ass.
But like for real. Like I really
will do that. This is the new me
talking and I get what I need, you
understand me, Stevie?"
446,STEVIE,446,"Alright, dude, I understand, you
sick fuck."
447,RONNIE,447,"Cool. In that case, have fun
shreadin'."
448,STEVIE,448,"Stop crying, Roy."
449,NELL,449,"Hey, sweetie -- Oh, I'm sorry,
good morning, Officer Barnhardt."
450,RONNIE,450,"Good morning, Nell."
451,NELL,451,"Where were you last night? I
tried to call, but your mom said
you weren't home from work yet."
452,RONNIE,452,"Look, I got to talk to you about
something. I'm not really sure
how to put this. Let's see. If
you drove a Toyota."
453,NELL,453,I drive a Ford.
454,RONNIE,454,"I know, but let's just pretend you
drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota
runs really good. It always
starts when you need it to and it
gets good gas mileage and you
don't have to do much to maintain
it. Then you get a really
important job like Astronaut, no
that won't work, you get a job as
the head of Wall Street. Well,
you may really like that Toyota,
but you're going to feel weird
about driving it to work every
day, right? Now let's say that
somebody offers you a chance to
get rid of that Toyota and instead
you get a Ferrari. It may be more
expensive and harder to drive, but
I mean, it just looks good as
hell. What would you do?"
455,NELL,455,I don't get it.
456,RONNIE,456,"You would trade up, Nell. Well,
that's exactly what I'm doing."
457,NELL,457,"Are you thinking about getting a
new car?"
458,RONNIE,458,"No, Nell, I'm getting a new
girlfriend."
459,NELL,459,What?!   Who?
460,RONNIE,460,"This girl, Brandi."
461,NELL,461,"The slutty girl who works at the
make-up counter?"
462,RONNIE,462,"Yeah, I mean, no, she's not a
slut. But you're thinking of the
right person."
463,NELL,463,How could you do this to me?
464,RONNIE,464,"I'm sorry. I don't mean to hurt
you. It's just, well, I believe
in this world, you play the hand
you're dealt and at this point in
my life, I've been dealt five
Aces. I'd be a fool not to bet."
465,NELL,465,"Why are you doing this, Ronnie?"
466,RONNIE,466,"I have to, Nell."
467,NELL,467,Don't you love me?
468,RONNIE,468,Of course I love you.
469,NELL,469,Then tell me why?
470,RONNIE,470,"Because I've never dated the prom
queen before."
471,NELL,471,"Remember when you started this
job? You weren't such a hotshot
then. I've stood by you when you
were at your worst. Every time
you fell, I held your hand and
told you everything would be okay.
Time and time again."
472,RONNIE,472,"Come on.   Why do you have to bring
that up?"
473,NELL,473,"I never cared about who you wanted
to be, I fell in love with who you
really are. If you leave me,
Ronnie, I won't be there to pick
you up when you fall."
474,RONNIE,474,"Even if I do fall, it won't
matter, because I'm learning to
fly."
475,SLICK SALESMAN,475,"Can I help you, sir?"
476,RONNIE,476,"Yeah, um, I've got a really
special date tonight with a hot
young lady -- Do you know Brandi?"
477,SLICK SALESMAN,477,No.
478,RONNIE,478,"Never mind. Anyway, I need
something that's really 'cool.'
Something that will impress her
and I guess you could say I'm not
exactly in the know with what the
hipsters are up to these days."
479,SLICK SALESMAN,479,"Let's see. Are you looking to
fall in love or are you looking to
get laid?"
480,RONNIE,480,"Um, I guess love, but uh..."
481,SLICK SALESMAN,481,"You want to get laid, too?"
482,RONNIE,482,"Watch it, man.     She's a lady.   But
yes."
483,SLICK SALESMAN,483,"Alright, I got just the thing.
Something classy is what you want.
Show her you're a man with taste."
484,MOM,484,"Come on, Ronnie, just get out
here."
485,RONNIE,485,It's too tight in the butt.
486,MOM,486,Let me see.
487,MOM,487,"Ronnie, you look so handsome!"
488,RONNIE,488,"Really, you don't think I look
like a phony."
489,MOM,489,"Hell no.   You look like a stud
muffin."
490,RONNIE,490,"Yeah, I guess these clothes are
kind of cool."
491,MOM,491,Nell is a lucky girl.
492,RONNIE,492,"Its not Nell, Mom."
493,MOM,493,"Really, I thought you and Nell
were going to get married some
day."
494,RONNIE,494,"I did too. But then I met this
girl Brandi and she swept me off
my feet."
495,MOM,495,"Well, I always liked Nell, but as
long as you're happy, Ronnie,
that's all I care about."
496,RONNIE,496,"I actually feel kind of bad about
Nell, but I figure that I can pour
all the sadness into Brandi and
just really rely on her for my
happiness instead of Nell."
497,MOM,497,"That sounds wonderful.   Is she
pretty?"
498,RONNIE,498,"She is, Mom. She's the most
perfect girl in the whole world."
499,MOM,499,"I remember when your father picked
me up for our first date. I swear
he was the most handsome man that
I had ever laid eyes on. I knew
right then and there that this
would be the man that I married."
500,RONNIE,500,I hope that happens tonight.
501,MOM,501,"It will, Ronnie. Then you'll have
to give her a ring like the one
your father gave me."
502,RONNIE,502,Is that a yellow diamond?
503,MOM,503,"It's a glass diamond.   This is how
it looks now."
504,RONNIE,504,"Mom, why did Dad leave?"
505,MOM,505,"Well, he kind of freaked out when
you were born. You had so many
special needs that he just
couldn't handle the pressure. One
day, he just couldn't take it
anymore."
506,RONNIE,506,"Do you think it was my fault that
Dad left?"
507,MOM,507,"Definitely. You don't think it
was mine do you?"
508,RONNIE,508,"Well, I didn't know, with the
drinking and all."
509,MOM,509,"Nope, it was all you."
510,MOM,510,"I love you, Ronnie."
511,RONNIE,511,"I love you, too, Mom."
512,RONNIE,512,"Damn, that was pretty impressive."
513,BRANDI,513,"Yeah, work's been pissing me off,
so I just need to blow off some
steam."
514,RONNIE,514,"Well, Brandi, can I just say that
you look absolutely beautiful
tonight."
515,BRANDI,515,"Yeah, I know."
516,BRANDI,516,Nurse! Get me another --
517,BRANDI,517,"You got this, right?"
518,RONNIE,518,"Yeah, yeah.   No problem."
519,BRANDI,519,"Nurse! Bring me another and keep
'em coming."
520,BRANDI,520,"I think it's funny to call the
waitress nurse."
521,BRANDI,521,"Hey, what's that?"
522,RONNIE,522,"Oh, it's nothing."
523,BRANDI,523,"Don't be stingy, what the fuck is
that?"
524,RONNIE,524,"It's just a pill I'm supposed to
take."
525,BRANDI,525,Let me see.
526,BRANDI,526,Where the fuck did you find these?
527,RONNIE,527,The Doctor.
528,BRANDI,528,"Damn, Ronnie, Klonopin. I'm
impressed. This is the good shit.
I didn't know you partied like
this."
529,RONNIE,529,"Yeah, I guess I party like this
every four to six hours as needed."
530,BRANDI,530,Let me get one.
531,RONNIE,531,Help yourself.
532,BRANDI,532,Hell yeah!
533,RONNIE,533,"So, how do you like working at the
mall?"
534,BRANDI,534,"I hate that shit. All I do is
listen to bitching all day long.
I got to put makeup on these fat-
ass women all day and it's like, I
don't give a shit what you do, you
can't polish a turd."
535,RONNIE,535,"Yeah, I see how that could get to
you."
536,BRANDI,536,"Let's do some shots.      Waiter, four
shots of Jager!"
537,RONNIE,537,That's a lot.
538,BRANDI,538,It's Friday.
539,RONNIE,539,"So, Brandi, I hope I'm not being
too forward, but do you have a
boyfriend?"
540,BRANDI,540,"I've got a few hook-ups but nobody
who is a boyfriend."
541,RONNIE,541,Yes!
542,BRANDI,542,"You know, it's just like a time in
my life where I want to be free
right now and think about myself.
Not get tied down to one person."
543,RONNIE,543,"Yeah, I understand. I hate ties.
I recently cut mine and now I'm
free like a bird."
544,BRANDI,544,"Alright, bottoms up."
545,RONNIE,545,To new beginnings.
546,BRANDI,546,Right up your ass!
547,RONNIE,547,Okay.
548,BRANDI,548,"Oh, shit!"
549,RONNIE,549,No more.    I'm sticking to beer.
550,BRANDI,550,"What's wrong, is your pussy
hurting?"
551,RONNIE,551,"God, you remind me so much of my
mother."
552,BRANDI,552,"Feel the burn, bitch!"
553,RONNIE,553,You are so beautiful.
554,BRANDI,554,Who wants to see my titties?!
555,RONNIE,555,"Brandi, this is the most fun I've
ever had on a date."
556,BRANDI,556,"For the last time, this ain't a
date, motherfucker! This is a
party!"
557,RONNIE,557,"Wooo! Um, so, Brandi, it's no
secret that I'm attracted to you.
I think everybody in the mall is.
As you know, I recently split with
my girlfriend and basically, I was
wondering if, since you don't have
a boyfriend, that I could maybe be
your boyfriend and you could be my
girlfriend?"
558,BRANDI,558,That's my house!
559,RONNIE,559,"Brandi, I had a wonderful time
tonight."
560,BRANDI,560,I'm so fucking shit-faced.
561,RONNIE,561,Are you okay?
562,BRANDI,562,My breath smells like asshole.
563,RONNIE,563,"I love you, Brandi."
564,BRANDI,564,I think I've got puke in my teeth.
565,RONNIE,565,I don't care.
566,RONNIE,566,"Don't look at me like that,
Dennis. I told you I wouldn't
talk."
567,RONNIE,567,"I'm serious, Dennis. A gentleman
never kisses and tells. So, just
stop with all the pressure because
it's just not gonna happen."
568,RONNIE,568,"Okay, fine, you son of a bitch,
you want details, I'll give you
details. I had sex with Brandi
last night."
569,RONNIE,569,"It was amazing. I mean, I've
never experienced anything like
it. I've been with a girl or two."
570,RONNIE,570,"Okay, fine, I've been with a girl,
but let me tell you, this was so
much better. You know how many
times we did it? Twice! BAM!
BAM! BAM!"
571,RONNIE,571,"But I got to tell you, Dennis. It
was steamy and sexy, but more than
anything, I should tell you that
it's her soul that I fell for the
most. She got pretty tanked, but
I could just really tell that
she's a good person. The kind of
person that I could see myself
with."
572,RONNIE (CONT'D),572,"Look, I'm gonna get out of here.
There's a lot of people I need to
tell about this, so I'll catch up
with you later. Oh, and I almost
forgot, keep your eyes peeled for
crime and stuff."
573,NELL,573,Excuse me.
574,BRANDI,574,How may I help you?
575,NELL,575,I need to talk to you.
576,BRANDI,576,"What is it, honey? Let me guess.
You're looking for something to
take care of those blackheads and
hide that puffiness under your
eyes. I've got just the thing."
577,NELL,577,"No, that's not it.    Well, how much
is it?"
578,BRANDI,578,Fifty dollars for the bottle.
579,NELL,579,"Okay, I'll take it."
580,NELL,580,"Listen, I know you're Ronnie's new
girlfriend."
581,BRANDI,581,"What the hell are you talking
about?"
582,NELL,582,"It's okay. I know he left me to
be with you and I accept that."
583,BRANDI,583,"I don't know who you've been
talking to, but it's safe to say
that you're fucking trippin'."
584,NELL,584,"It's fine really. It's going to
take a while for me to get over
it, but I'll be okay."
585,BRANDI,585,"Oh fuckin' Lord. This is
disgusting."
586,NELL,586,I'm sorry.
587,BRANDI,587,"Pull it together. This is how you
run around all the time? Have
some self-respect. No wonder your
man left you. Who the hell would
want to be around this shit all
day?"
588,NELL,588,"Jesus teaches us to forgive. And
I forgive you for what you did to
me when you stole my boyfriend.
Plus, I feel pretty confident that
you'll end up burning in hell
because of the various evil ways
you live your life and that brings
me some satisfaction. But I just
want to tell you that Ronnie is a
good person. He does a lot of
stupid stuff, but really, he wants
to do good for the world. I want
you to know that if you hurt him
and ruin his heart, I will
personally come down here and kick
the ever living shit out of you."
589,BRANDI,589,"You better fuckin' run, bitch!"
590,BRANDI,590,I'm just kidding.
591,NELL,591,"It's not too late to change your
ways."
592,BRUCE,592,Okay.   Thanks.
593,FLOWER SALESMAN,593,"Ronnie, I've been expecting you."
594,RONNIE,594,You have?
595,FLOWER SALESMAN,595,"Oh yeah, I heard about last night.
Brandi is quite the woman.
Congratulations, my friend. Or
should I say, welcome to the club?"
596,RONNIE,596,"What color of roses do the women
like anyway?"
597,FLOWER SALESMAN,597,"Well, it depends on what you are
trying to say. The white roses
symbolize innocence and purity."
598,RONNIE,598,"Yeah, we're way past the color
white if you know what I mean.
What about the yellow ones?"
599,FLOWER SALESMAN,599,"Joy, happiness, appreciation."
600,RONNIE,600,"I don't even know what to make of
that."
601,FLOWER SALESMAN,601,The pink rose means thank you.
602,RONNIE,602,Next.
603,FLOWER SALESMAN,603,"The red rose is the most powerful.
It symbolizes love."
604,RONNIE,604,"Why didn't you just say that?    I'm
a busy man here."
605,FLOWER SALESMAN,605,I'm sorry.
606,RONNIE,606,"Forget it. Give me a big bag of
the red ones."
607,FLOWER SALESMAN,607,"Um, can I ask a question?"
608,RONNIE,608,Go ahead.
609,FLOWER SALESMAN,609,Do you really like Brandi?
610,RONNIE,610,"I've only been on one date with
her, but I could see myself being
with her for all of eternity."
611,FLOWER SALESMAN,611,"Well, in that case, the greatest
symbol of love is just a single
red rose."
612,RONNIE,612,"Seems   like a big bag of roses
would   be more love than just one,
but I   guess you're the expert.
Gimme   one."
613,RONNIE,613,Brandi?
614,BRANDI,614,What are you doing here?
615,RONNIE,615,"I came here to see you. And to
present you with this single red
rose. It symbolizes 'love.'"
616,BRANDI,616,"Ronnie, that's really... uncalled
for."
617,RONNIE,617,"Well, after last night,   I just
wanted you to know that   it wasn't
just some fling to me.    It meant
something special and I   felt it
deep in my soul."
618,BRUCE,618,You fucked the Security Guard?
619,BRUCE,619,You are such a little slut!
620,BRANDI,620,"Oh, like you've never been drunk,
Bruce!"
621,BRANDI,621,"Ronnie, look. I got to be honest
with you. I barely remember last
night."
622,RONNIE,622,I remember it for the both of us.
623,BRANDI,623,"Okay, see here's the thing. I
don't know how to say this, so I'm
just gonna come on out with it.
Ronnie, I could never date you
seriously. I mean, you're a
security guard."
624,RONNIE,624,I'm the head of Mall Security.
625,BRANDI,625,"Exactly. The point is, I don't
really see myself being with that.
Like ever. You know what I mean?"
626,RONNIE,626,"Brandi, I know exactly what you
mean. And I just want to thank
you for being honest. You're
telling me I'm not living up to my
full potential in life. It's
funny, because I've been feeling
like this for quite some time. I
guess I just needed that extra
little push to get me over this
hurdle I've been stuck on. How
can you be with a man who isn't
living the life he was meant to?"
627,BRANDI,627,"Yeah, something like that. And
just you know, you're a security
guard at the mall and it's like,
come on, you know?"
628,RONNIE,628,"I don't like it, Brandi, but I do
understand. I promise you this.
Next time you see me, I will be
wearing a uniform that will make
you proud. I will be the man that
you will be honored to call your
life's love."
629,BRANDI,629,Don't bet on it.
630,RONNIE,630,"I will though. I'll bet
everything I have on you. Now I
ask you for one favor. Although I
am unworthy, will you accept this
rose from me anyway?"
631,BRANDI,631,"I can't do that. And tell your
girlfriend to stop coming by my
work and threatening me and shit."
632,RONNIE,632,"I'm here to become a police
officer."
633,POLICEMAN,633,"We're always on the hunt for new
recruits. Do you have at least a
high school diploma?"
634,RONNIE,634,I have a GED.
635,POLICEMAN,635,"We usually prefer an actual
diploma, but GED is technically
acceptable. Are you a citizen of
the United States?"
636,RONNIE,636,You bet your ass I am.
637,POLICEMAN,637,"Okay, Mr. Barnhardt, there are
several steps you have to complete
in order to be eligible for the
police academy. Physical
evaluation, psychological test,
background check."
638,POLICEMAN (CONT'D),638,"If you pass these tests, you will
be admitted to the police academy.
Now, I like to tell all new
recruits that they should complete
a ride along before making this
decision. It's where you actually
ride along with a real police
officer during a routine patrol.
It helps give you an idea of the
kind of situations you'll be
dealing with. Sound good?"
639,RONNIE,639,That sounds fun. Sign me up.
640,RONNIE,640,"It's like it was meant to be. You
behind the wheel. Me riding shotgun.
Two brothers of the badge unite to
form the ultimate crime-stopping combo.
I'm psyched to be here, Harrison.
Thank you for the opportunity."
641,DETECTIVE HARRISON,641,You requested to ride along with me.
642,RONNIE,642,"I know. You want to know the
truth. It's because I respect
you. See, when we're at the mall,
it's obviously my turf. Sure, I
break your balls about being a
rookie, but out here in the
streets, I'm the rookie. I'm here
to learn. Teach me."
643,DETECTIVE HARRISON,643,Why do you want to become a Cop?
644,RONNIE,644,"I've wanted to be a Police officer
all my life."
645,RONNIE (CONT'D),645,"Don't get me wrong, I love keeping
the mall safe, but you guys are
the ones that really enforce
justice and protect, not just our
mall, but our whole community. I
don't tell the guys on my squad
this, but the Security Guard job
was just temporary."
646,DETECTIVE HARRISON,646,"Well, just pay attention tonight
and make sure you stay out of the
way."
647,RONNIE,647,"Right, we're not back at the
station anymore so we can cut the
charade."
648,DETECTIVE HARRISON,648,What are you talking about?
649,RONNIE,649,"Well, I know that policy demands I
stay out of the way, but between
you and me, I just want you to
know that if anything pops off
tonight, I'm going to jump right
in there and take 'em down with
you."
650,DETECTIVE HARRISON,650,"No, no. Ronnie, policy says you
have to stay in the car."
651,RONNIE,651,"I get you. You have to say this
in order to keep you safe
'legally' speaking. I should
probably follow along too. 'I
swear I won't get out of the car
and fight justice tonight.'"
652,DETECTIVE HARRISON,652,"Ronnie, you really can't."
653,RONNIE,653,I know.
654,DETECTIVE HARRISON,654,I'm glad we understand each other.
655,RONNIE,655,"Yeah, so then I basically saw his
ass trying to circumvent around
the ped exit and slip through the
employ exit. Not allowed. The
two ped exits are to be used
only --"
656,DETECTIVE HARRISON,656,"You see that corner there, Ronnie?"
657,RONNIE,657,"Yeah, I see it."
658,DETECTIVE HARRISON,658,"That corner used to be the worst
corner in this whole town. It was
riddled with drugs, prostitution,
and gang violence. It was
nicknamed 'The Crossroads.'"
659,RONNIE,659,"Shit, I've heard of that."
660,DETECTIVE HARRISON,660,"That's right, but myself and the
other officers worked on cleaning
it up for years so that the good
folks of this neighborhood
wouldn't have to worry about being
safe. Yes, sir, that corner is a
testament to the fine police work
of our force."
661,RONNIE,661,"I don't know.    It looks pretty
shitty to me."
662,DETECTIVE HARRISON,662,"Well, it's a low income area,
Ronnie. You're being kind of
prejudiced."
663,RONNIE,663,"Oh, yeah, I can see that it's
basically a fine neighborhood."
664,DETECTIVE HARRISON,664,"That's right, but it hasn't been
easy. We still patrol this area
every night just to keep our
presence up."
665,RONNIE,665,"I use that same technique at the
mall."
666,DETECTIVE HARRISON,666,"I'm sure. I usually do the foot
patrols myself, but because I like
you, I'm going to let you do it
tonight."
667,RONNIE,667,Really?
668,DETECTIVE HARRISON,668,"Yeah,   really. But I told you
about   department policy, so I'm
going   to need you to keep quiet
about   this one."
669,RONNIE,669,"You can count on me.     Thank you
for the honor."
670,DETECTIVE HARRISON,670,"Of course, Ronnie. I just really
believe in you."
671,RONNIE,671,I won't let you down.
672,RONNIE,672,Where are you going?!
673,RONNIE,673,"Hey, no horse play. You guys get
on home."
674,KID,674,You want some crack?
675,RONNIE,675,"No, I don't want any crack. In
fact, I didn't want to do this,
but you leave me no choice in the
matter. I'm placing you under
citizen's arrest."
676,KID,676,"Let me go, motherfucker!"
677,RONNIE,677,"I place you under citizen's arrest
for the crime of selling a
Schedule 1 Narcotic. You have the
right to remain silent..."
678,RONNIE,678,"... If you cannot afford an
attorney, one will be appointed to
you. Now I guess we just wait
here for my ride to come back."
679,GANG MEMBER #1,679,"That's my little brother you got
there."
680,RONNIE,680,"Who, this little guy right here?"
681,GANG MEMBER #1,681,That's right.
682,RONNIE,682,"Well, I hate to be the one to tell
you this, but it appears that your
little brother has tried to sell
me illegal drugs. I know it's
hard for you to hear that."
683,GANG MEMBER #1,683,"He works for me, motherfucker!"
684,RONNIE,684,"Is that so? Well then, it looks
like you got one less employee
because I'm taking little brother
down. I'll die right here before
I let crime prevail."
685,RONNIE,685,"Free to go, little brother. My
mistake completely. Good luck
with the crack."
686,RONNIE,686,"Alright, so I guess I'll be seeing
you folks."
687,GANG MEMBER #2,687,"Yo, waste this pig, Tone."
688,RONNIE,688,"Oh, no. That's really not
necessary, Tone."
689,GANG MEMBER #2,689,"Do it, man."
690,RONNIE,690,"Oh, Jesus, I don't want to die.
Don't let me die, don't do it!"
691,RONNIE,691,"No, please!   I'm sorry!"
692,COP #1,692,"I can't believe you dropped him
off at the Crossroads. That's
fucking hilarious."
693,DETECTIVE HARRISON,693,"Trust me, you would have done the
same thing. This guy is without a
doubt the biggest fucking idiot I
have ever met."
694,COP #1,694,He's probably going to get killed.
695,DETECTIVE HARRISON,695,"Good! Fuck him, I hope he does
get killed."
696,DETECTIVE HARRISON,696,"Ronnie, what are you doing here?"
697,RONNIE,697,I know what you did!
698,DETECTIVE HARRISON,698,"Ronnie, look, I didn't do anything --"
699,RONNIE,699,"You're not going to talk your way
out of this one. You set me up!"
700,DETECTIVE HARRISON,700,"Ronnie, look --"
701,RONNIE,701,"Don't try to deny it! You set me
up and that's all there is to it."
702,DETECTIVE HARRISON,702,"Ronnie, I --"
703,RONNIE,703,"And I just want to thank you for
it."
704,DETECTIVE HARRISON,704,Thank me?   Why?
705,RONNIE,705,"Because I'm proud to report that I
passed the test. I know you
wanted to see if I had the chops
to cut it on the police force and
I'm glad to say that I passed. I
knew I would get initiated some
time, but I didn't think it would
be so soon. Thank you, Detective
Harrison. Thank you for believing
in me."
706,DETECTIVE HARRISON,706,"Ronnie, I don't know what to say."
707,RONNIE,707,"You don't have to say anything.
Your actions speak for themselves.
Thank you for giving this rookie a
shot. Get used to seeing Ronnie
Barnhardt around here, boys."
708,MARK,708,Come in.
709,RONNIE,709,"Good morning, Mark."
710,MARK,710,"Is it, Ronnie? I mean, the mall
is getting butchered in the press.
Somebody who works here is ripping
the place off. The cops don't
have any leads. I'm getting shit
from the owner of the mall. Sales
are down. I mean, what's so good
about this morning?"
711,RONNIE,711,"I feel your pain, Mark. Quite
frankly, there's two things
happening. One, I'm lacking a
sufficient firearm. And two,
we're understaffed. That's why I
come to you this morning with a
plan."
712,RONNIE,712,"Come on in, Charles."
713,MARK,713,Who is this?
714,RONNIE,714,"This is Charles, sir."
715,CHARLES,715,How's it going?
716,MARK,716,"You work at O'Charley's, right."
717,CHARLES,717,That's right.
718,RONNIE,718,"Mark, I would like to hire Charles
here as an additional Security
Guard. He would operate under me.
I figure with the additional
criminal element, we should hire
more security in hopes that we
would have a better chance of
catching these guys."
719,MARK,719,"Do you have any experience, son?"
720,CHARLES,720,Not really.
721,RONNIE,721,"Um, sir, I have personally been
training young Charles for weeks
now in preparation for this day.
The kid kind of looks up to me.
I'm some what of a big brother to
the little guy."
722,MARK,722,"Alright, it's actually not a bad
idea. It might make our Security
more visible so we can give people
the illusion that we're on top of
this."
723,CHARLES,723,"Thank you, Mark."
724,MARK,724,"Ronnie, one more thing. Look, if
this crime doesn't come to an end
pretty soon, we're gonna have to
let someone go. I mean, you've
always done a great job for me,
but the truth is, someone is going
to have to take the fall. You're
the one who wanted to be Head of
Mall Security and quite frankly, I
just bought my wife a new
Cadillac, so let's just say it
won't be me."
725,RONNIE,725,"With Charles on my team, I can now
devote more time to the robbery
and Pervert case. I plan on
having these wrapped up by the end
of the week."
726,RONNIE,726,Why'd you just laugh?
727,MARK,727,"It's nothing.    Have fun, Ronnie."
728,RONNIE,728,Did I say something funny?
729,CHARLES,729,"Let's go, Ronnie."
730,CHARLES,730,"Be careful, guys. Nice and slow."
731,RONNIE,731,"That's not bad, but you need to
learn to speak in a more
authoritative voice. Watch this.
Slow it down! Slow it down!
You've already received one
verbal, don't make me issue a
second!"
732,RONNIE,732,"See, you can't be intimidated.
You have to make them respect you."
733,CHARLES,733,"Ronnie, you know I really want to
thank you for the job. You're a
man of your word."
734,RONNIE,734,"No problem, my young student. So,
I got something to tell you. Keep
this between us until it's
official, but I don't think I'm
going to be here for much longer."
735,CHARLES,735,"You're quitting? But you love
this job."
736,RONNIE,736,"I do love it, but it looks like
someone is going to be joining the
police force."
737,CHARLES,737,The real police?
738,RONNIE,738,"They're calling me up. It's
basically a done deal. Just a
little red tape is the only thing
keeping me from carrying a gun."
739,CHARLES,739,"I didn't even know you wanted to
become a Cop."
740,RONNIE,740,"It's always been my job. The Mall
thing is great training, but it
has its limitations. Some stars
are just meant to shine brighter
than others."
741,CHARLES,741,"Congrats, brother."
742,RONNIE,742,"HEY, SLOW IT DOWN, LADY!"
743,RONNIE,743,Nell?
744,NELL,744,"Hey, Ronnie."
745,RONNIE,745,What are you doing?
746,NELL,746,"Nothing, just getting in shape."
747,RONNIE,747,"Well, that's okay, I guess.   Just
watch your speed, okay?"
748,CHARLES,748,Isn't that your girlfriend?
749,RONNIE,749,Ex.
750,CHARLES,750,She looked good.
751,RONNIE,751,You think so?
752,CHARLES,752,She looks a lot better.
753,RONNIE,753,Yeah.
754,PSYCHOLOGIST,754,"Okay, Ronnie, today I'll be giving
you a psychiatric evaluation to
determine if you're competent to
enter into the Police Academy.
It's really just a formality.
Don't want any serial killers
working for us, now do we?"
755,RONNIE,755,"No, ma'am, we don't."
756,PSYCHOLOGIST,756,"Okay, Ronnie, so let's start with
your background. Where are you
from?"
757,RONNIE,757,Born and raised right here.
758,PSYCHOLOGIST,758,"Local boy. Okay, and, Ronnie,
have you ever been convicted of
any crimes?"
759,RONNIE,759,"No, ma'am.   My record is totally
clean."
760,PSYCHOLOGIST,760,"Do you now take any illegal drugs
or have you taken any in the past?"
761,RONNIE,761,"No, ma'am. I believe drugs are
the path to self-destruction and
should be purged from the face of
the earth with ruthless vengeance."
762,PSYCHOLOGIST,762,Any prescription medications?
763,RONNIE,763,"Yes, for my nerves. A man in my
line of work has a lot of stress
to deal with. If you've seen the
bloodshed I've seen, you'd be on
the meds too. I -- Where are you
going with this?"
764,PSYCHOLOGIST,764,"Are you presently or have you ever
been affiliated with the Communist
Party?"
765,RONNIE,765,"I can't believe you'd even ask me
that."
766,PSYCHOLOGIST,766,"Have you ever been in the
military?"
767,RONNIE,767,Yes.
768,PSYCHOLOGIST,768,"What branch of the military were
you in?"
769,RONNIE,769,"The kind of branch that doesn't
exist on paper."
770,PSYCHOLOGIST,770,"Okay, here's a real world
scenario. You have a gun --"
771,RONNIE,771,Finally.
772,PSYCHOLOGIST,772,"That wasn't really the question,
never mind, I think I got that
one. Um... here's one. Do you
feel like you would work well on a
team?"
773,RONNIE,773,"Would I? Yes. Would I be more
useful working alone, I would say
definitely. I see myself more
like a Rambo kind of guy. A man
who rolls solo. Taking care of
business on his own terms. Kind
of like a Superhero or something."
774,PSYCHOLOGIST,774,Why do you want to become a cop?
775,RONNIE,775,"I want to become a cop to help
people. The world is a scary
place with lots of evil
everywhere. See, I have this
vision of evil trying to get at
the world from every angle and
there I stand at the top of it all
with my gun, just kind of blowing
it away. Just me and my weapons,
cleaning up this whole town. I
know I could do some good if I was
just given a chance and everybody
would be a lot better off."
776,PSYCHOLOGIST,776,"Uh-huh. So, what do you feel is
the greatest danger facing a
police officer today?"
777,RONNIE,777,"Maybe Russian gang activity, but
you know what? I think I'm gonna
have to go with evil on that one
too."
778,PSYCHOLOGIST,778,"Okay, I think we're good here.
It's been a pleasure, Ronnie."
779,RONNIE,779,"Thank you, ma'am."
780,RONNIE,780,"I'm telling you, Mom, this police
thing could be good for both of
us. Not just the fact that I'll
be making the streets safer for
you, but they have health
insurance and a pension plan so I
don't have to worry about your
medical bills as much."
781,MOM,781,"I don't care about that bullshit.
All I need is a little nip of this
good shit right here and I'm ready
to walk through the pearly gates."
782,RONNIE,782,"Mom, I know, but maybe you should
stop drinking so much. You're
getting up there and you know what
the doctor said about your liver."
783,MOM,783,"I don't tell you how to party,
don't tell me how to live my life.
I've taken care of you since you
were born."
784,RONNIE,784,I just worry about you is all.
785,MOM,785,"Ronnie, don't get your hopes up
about this police thing."
786,RONNIE,786,Why would you say that?
787,MOM,787,"You know why. I just don't want
to see you get hurt. It's my job
to protect you from the bullshit."
788,RONNIE,788,"Mom, I appreciate it, but I'm
going to make it as a police
officer. I'm tired of coming in
second all the time. Everybody in
life gets to go for their goals,
why should I be any different?"
789,MOM,789,"I know. Just be careful is all.
You've got a good heart and I
don't want to see it broken."
790,RONNIE,790,"Okay, Mom.   I hear you."
791,MOM,791,"And, Ronnie, one more thing."
792,RONNIE,792,"What's that, Mom?"
793,RONNIE,793,Mom!   That's gross!
794,MOM,794,"That's right! Now you got to
smell it!"
795,RONNIE,795,Mom.
796,RONNIE,796,"Ronnie Barnhardt reporting for
duty."
797,DETECTIVE HARRISON,797,"I can see that. Listen, I don't
really know how to say this, but
we're not going to be able to let
you join the academy."
798,RONNIE,798,What?!   Why not?
799,DETECTIVE HARRISON,799,"It seems you had a little trouble
passing the minimum requirements."
800,RONNIE,800,Did I fail one of the tests?
801,DETECTIVE HARRISON,801,"Well, yes, actually, you failed
the psychological exam."
802,RONNIE,802,No!
803,DETECTIVE HARRISON,803,It says...
804,DETECTIVE HARRISON,804,"That Ronnie Barnhardt shows
warning signs of delusion and
allowing him to join the force
puts his life and the lives of
others in jeopardy."
805,RONNIE,805,"Detective Harrison, you've got to
believe me. I'm completely sound.
This has got to be a mistake."
806,DETECTIVE HARRISON,806,"Ronnie, I personally did your
background check and this is the
fifth time you've been turned down
for the police academy."
807,RONNIE,807,You guys keep records on that?
808,DETECTIVE HARRISON,808,"We sure do. Look, I tried to talk
to them, but there's no way
they're gonna let you in. I'm
sorry, but your dreams of becoming
a Police Officer just aren't going
to happen."
809,RONNIE,809,"I understand. Thanks for
believing in me, Detective. And
just for the record, I'm not
crazy."
810,DETECTIVE HARRISON,810,"Take care, Ronnie."
811,RONNIE,811,"Hey, Nell."
812,NELL,812,"Hey, Ronnie.   How's it going?"
813,RONNIE,813,Can I talk to you for a second?
814,NELL,814,What is it?
815,RONNIE,815,"I tried to get into the police
academy again and the same thing
happened."
816,NELL,816,"Oh, Ronnie, I'm sorry."
817,RONNIE,817,"Why does this keep happening to
me, Nell?"
818,NELL,818,"I don't know, Ronnie.    Maybe it's
just not meant to be.    Are you
okay?"
819,RONNIE,819,"No. Are you going home? I mean,
do you want to go somewhere and
talk or something?"
820,NELL,820,"Ronnie, I can't."
821,RONNIE,821,Why not?
822,NELL,822,I've got plans.
823,RONNIE,823,What plans?
824,SADDAMN,824,Look at this sorry piece of shit.
825,RONNIE,825,What the fuck do you want?
826,SADDAMN,826,I don't want anything from you.
827,SADDAMN,827,"How you doing, sweetness?"
828,SADDAMN,828,You look beautiful tonight.
829,RONNIE,829,What the fuck is going on?
830,SADDAMN,830,"You ready to go? We got
reservations at 9:00."
831,NELL,831,"I'm ready, Saddamn."
832,RONNIE,832,"Nell, for the love of God, don't
go with him."
833,NELL,833,"I'm sorry, Ronnie."
834,RONNIE,834,"Don't go, Nell. Remember your
purity! Remember your purity!"
835,STEVIE,835,"What are you doing, Ronnie?"
836,RONNIE,836,"I'm just taking a break. What do
you want, Stevie? I don't have
time to fuck around with you
today."
837,STEVIE,837,I got something.
838,RONNIE,838,What the fuck is this?
839,DUDE,839,"Dude, I found these all over the
mall. I'm guessing that whoever
this Mall Flasher is, left these
for girls to find."
840,RONNIE,840,"This thing gets grosser and
grosser all the time. Well,
thanks for the clue. Maybe I can
use this to identify the freak.
You can skate all you want around
here."
841,STEVIE,841,"What's wrong with you, Ronnie?"
842,RONNIE,842,What do you mean?
843,STEVIE,843,"I don't know.    You just seem kind
of sad."
844,RONNIE,844,"Nah, man, I'm fine. I mean, I'm
catchin' perverts and protecting
this mall and just you know,
really livin' the dream."
845,STEVIE,845,"That's cool.    Look, man, you want
to get high?"
846,RONNIE,846,"No, I don't want to get high."
847,STEVIE,847,That's cool.
848,RONNIE,848,"And by the way, if I see you
getting high, I will call the
police and have your criminal ass
arrested. Don't you fuckin' ever
mistake my kindness for weakness.
I hate drugs and I hate you too."
849,STEVIE,849,"Fine, you fucking dick."
850,BRANDI,850,Shhhh.
851,DETECTIVE HARRISON,851,What is it?
852,BRANDI,852,I thought I heard something.
853,DETECTIVE HARRISON,853,It's nothing.
854,RONNIE,854,HARRISON!!!
855,BRANDI,855,Shit!
856,DETECTIVE HARRISON,856,That motherfucker is crazy.
857,BRANDI,857,"Well, you're the fucking cop.   Do
something."
858,DETECTIVE HARRISON,858,"You're right.    Okay, here it goes."
859,BRANDI,859,What the fuck are you doing?!
860,BRANDI,860,"Ronnie, it's me! Don't do
anything crazy."
861,RONNIE,861,"Get back inside, Brandi. This
isn't about you... you... you
slut!"
862,BRANDI,862,"Fuck off, Ronnie."
863,RONNIE,863,"How can you just stand there after
you ruined my life and act like
nothing happened?!"
864,BRANDI,864,"It's easy 'cause I don't give a
FUCK ABOUT YOU!"
865,DETECTIVE HARRISON,865,"Drop the flashlight, Ronnie."
866,RONNIE,866,You're pretty tough with that gun.
867,DETECTIVE HARRISON,867,"Ronnie, I know you've had a hard
time --"
868,RONNIE,868,You were supposed to be my friend!
869,DETECTIVE HARRISON,869,So you're gonna kill Brandi?
870,RONNIE,870,I was just trying to scare her.
871,BRANDI,871,"You don't scare me, you piece of
shit."
872,DETECTIVE HARRISON,872,Ronnie!
873,RONNIE,873,"Fine, fuck you! Fuck all of you!
And, Harrison, you better be glad
you have a gun or I'd kick your
ass too. And you know what? I'm
taking my friendship back because
you don't deserve it! And,
Brandi, I'm taking my love back
too. I'm gonna leave now and you
two can just have fun. Have fun
sleeping tonight because something
tells me, you won't be able to."
874,DETECTIVE HARRISON,874,That guy is a nut job.
875,BRANDI,875,Tell me about it.
876,DETECTIVE HARRISON,876,So you slept with him?
877,BRANDI,877,"I was drunk okay. You gonna make
a big deal out of it."
878,DETECTIVE HARRISON,878,"No, I guess not."
879,BRANDI,879,Fine.
880,RONNIE,880,I'm disbanding the task force.
881,CHARLES,881,"Hey, Ronnie, that's crazy talk.
Are you cool?"
882,RONNIE,882,"No, I'm not cool, Charles. In
fact, shit is seriously fucked up.
I've got to protect the whole mall
by myself. Now, I got you this
fucking job, when are you going to
stop being a little baby and do
something for a change."
883,RONNIE,883,"'I don't want to do anything hard.
I just want to be a little bitch
and brag about dropping out of
college.' Grow a fucking pair,
will you, Chucky?"
884,CHARLES,884,"I'm gonna go check the parking
lot."
885,RONNIE,885,"I'm sorry, Charles! I didn't mean
it, buddy!"
886,RONNIE,886,"You know, Dennis, for the longest
time I made this job my whole
life. I looked at this mall as a
kingdom and I looked at Mark as
the King. I thought of myself as
the first Knight and the
customers, well, they were the
peasants. I lived by an old code
where one was bound by duty and
honor. But now I don't know if I
believe in that code anymore.
I've lost my way. Now I just feel
like it's one big kingdom of shit.
Right now, I got half a mind just
to let this whole place burn.
Burn it to the fucking ground!"
887,DENNIS,887,"I've been waiting on you to get on
my page this whole time. You
look at this mall as a Kingdom?!
Shit! I look at this place like a
motherfucking jail sentence. You
put on that uniform every morning,
but what are you really protecting?
Commerce and corporations and money.
Well I say, fuck that! I'm
a fucking outlaw and I'm going to
live that until the day I die. Now,
I can show you the way, but you've
got to be willing to accept it. So
I'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie. Are
you ready for a trip to the other side?"
888,RONNIE,888,You're goddamn right I'm ready.
889,DENNIS,889,Alright then.    Let's party.
890,DENNIS,890,"So, yeah, usually I take a joint
straight to the head before I
start work in this motherfucker,
but on really stressful days, I
like to get drunk too."
891,RONNIE,891,"Fuck it, give me the bottle."
892,DENNIS,892,"So then I usually come in here and
perv out on girls for about an
hour or two. I hooked up twice
last week. One was this Asian
chick and the other was this mom.
She wasn't that hot, but what else
do I got to do?"
893,DENNIS,893,Sweet Jesus in the morning.
894,DENNIS,894,"Dressing rooms are a great place
to hide out, because nobody is
really going to think of looking
for me here. You can nap or just
kind of hang out and just really
have some personal time. Hey,
hand me that camera."
895,DENNIS,895,"Thanks, Ronnie."
896,DENNIS,896,"Right before lunch I usually blaze
up again real good."
897,DENNIS,897,"Hey, what's up, motherfuckers?!"
898,STEVIE,898,"What up, Big Den?!"
899,DENNIS,899,"You know, smokin' that good good."
900,STEVIE,900,"Dude, why are you hanging out with
Ronnie?"
901,RONNIE,901,"Fuck you, Stevie!"
902,DENNIS,902,"Hey, Ronnie's alright.   Let me see
that stick."
903,BRANDI,903,That'll be $39.99.
904,MALE,904,My wife's gonna love this perfume.
905,BRANDI,905,I hope so.   It's my favorite.
906,DENNIS,906,"Come on, brother. Let's go."
907,MARK (V.O.),907,"Ronnie, we need you down at the
candy store. Some little brat has
been shoveling peanuts in his
mouth for the last hour."
908,RONNIE,908,"Dennis, I got to thank you for
today. Man, I was so down, but
you taught me that I don't need to
take things so seriously here. We
have a pointless existence. Who
gives a fuck?"
909,DENNIS,909,"Don't mention it, homey. I'm just
glad I got me a partner in crime."
910,RONNIE,910,"A partner. I like that. You
know, I've never really had a
friend before, but I think that
this could be the beginning of a
real good thing."
911,DENNIS,911,"You ain't even seen the best part.
After everybody leaves, I rob the
shit out of this place."
912,RONNIE,912,What do you mean?
913,DENNIS,913,I steal shit!
914,RONNIE,914,"You're the one who's been robbing
the mall?"
915,DENNIS,915,Hell yeah!   Who'd you think it was?!
916,RONNIE,916,"I can't believe this. Right in
front of my goddamn face this
whole time!"
917,DENNIS,917,"This probably will look good with
my complexion."
918,RONNIE,918,"Dennis, I can't take part in this."
919,DENNIS,919,"Ronnie, I thought you were down?!
What the fuck?! Here I am opening
up myself to you and you're just
gonna stick it to me like this.
What the fuck has this place ever
done for you? Don't you know that
people see us as jokes?! A
useless tool that's left in the
shed. Well that's not me. Not
now, not ever. I told you, I'm an
outlaw."
920,RONNIE,920,I can't let you rob the mall.
921,DENNIS,921,"What the fuck you mean you can't
let me?"
922,RONNIE,922,"Come on, Dennis. We're best
friends, so just put that stuff
back and let's go get a beer."
923,DENNIS,923,"Alright, Ronnie, you're right."
924,DENNIS,924,"I don't really know what I was
thinking. Robbing the mall?
Let's just go get that beer."
925,RONNIE,925,"Good, man.   That makes me feel
better."
926,DENNIS,926,"See ya in Mexico, bitch."
927,RONNIE,927,"Ramon, get your ass over here! Go
get my spare keys out of the office."
928,RONNIE,928,"Ramon! Goddamn it get back here!
Go get my goddamn keys."
929,MARK,929,"How fucking stupid do you have to
be?! I mean Dennis. What the
fuck, Ronnie? How could you not
have known it was Dennis? Then,
how the fuck could you be so
stupid as to let him get away.
OBSERVE AND REPORT. Those are the
only two things you have to do and
you can't do those worth a shit."
930,RONNIE,930,Can I speak now?
931,MARK,931,Go ahead.
932,RONNIE,932,Are you sure?
933,MARK,933,"Just start talking, Ronnie!"
934,RONNIE,934,"It seems only natural that 'some
people' would want to blame me and
truth be told I do put a lot of
that blame on myself. But some
people might say that the cops are
to blame for not catching them.
Some people might say that the
reason this happened was the
undeniable fact that I was under-
equipped and quite frankly,
lacking a sufficient firearm. But
not me. I carry this loss alone
deep inside my heart."
935,MARK,935,Good.   Because you're fired.
936,RONNIE,936,Fuck you.
937,MARK,937,"I'm serious, Ronnie. I've always
liked you, but there's just no
excuse for this. Somebody is
going down and I'll be damned if
it's going to be me. Now, don't
make a big thing out of this.
Just pack your shit and get out by
the end of the day."
938,RONNIE,938,"Wait a minute. I thought I could
trust you, Mark, and now you're
telling me that you're going to be
the one to put the knife in my
back. Fair weather friend you
are."
939,MARK,939,"I'm not your friend, I'm your
boss."
940,RONNIE,940,"You think you're so smart, Mark.
You don't know everything. If
you're firing me, then you can say
goodbye to your entire Security
staff. Because there is no
fucking way my team is going to
work here if you fire me. Isn't
that right, Charles?"
941,CHARLES,941,"Ronnie, I got to talk to you about
this. Mark asked me down here to
escort you out."
942,RONNIE,942,"And you told him to fuck off,
right? Charles? Right?"
943,CHARLES,943,"What the fuck do you want from me,
Ronnie?"
944,RONNIE,944,"This isn't happening! Everybody
is fucking me over?! I hate you
all."
945,CHARLES,945,"I'm sorry, Ronnie, but it's time
to go."
946,RONNIE,946,"Wait a minute.     I'll work for
free, Mark."
947,MARK,947,"No, Ronnie."
948,RONNIE,948,I'll pay you.
949,MARK,949,Nope.
950,RONNIE,950,I love you.
951,MARK,951,"Ronnie, Jesus have a little self-
respect."
952,RONNIE,952,"You don't love me, Mark?"
953,MARK,953,"Ronnie, it's over."
954,RONNIE,954,"Hey, Charles. Mark asked you down
here in case I got out of hand?
Well, get ready to earn your
money."
955,MARK,955,Stop him!
956,CHARLES,956,"Alright, Ronnie, that's enough."
957,MOM,957,What's on the agenda for today?
958,RONNIE,958,"I guess maybe look for a job or
something."
959,MOM,959,"Well, I know you're sad about it,
but try to look on the bright
side."
960,RONNIE,960,"There is no bright side.   My life
is over."
961,MOM,961,"Ronnie, you may not be smart or
handsome, but you've got dreams
inside of you and dreams make you
special. No matter what this
world tries to throw at you, they
can never take those dreams away."
962,RONNIE,962,"What the fuck are you talking
about, Mom?"
963,MOM,963,"I don't know. I'm drunk. I just
know that mothers are supposed to
talk like that to their children
when they're sad, so I tried.
What do you want from me?"
964,RONNIE,964,"Nothing. That's exactly what
you're supposed to do. I just
blew my life. I tried to be a big
shot, a hero and a stupid cop. I
wanted to be recognized for being
great. I should have just been
happy where I was at. I didn't do
my duty."
965,MOM,965,"Ronnie, the other night when I
soiled my pants right before I
puked myself, I was thinking about
how you would come home and find
me and clean me up. I knew you
would be there to find me and take
care of me, so I was able to pass
out on the floor and not worry.
If there's one thing you know
about, it's duty."
966,RONNIE,966,I do it because I love you.
967,MOM,967,"I know and I love you too,   Ronnie.
I haven't always been easy   to deal
with and most people would   have
thrown me away a long time   ago."
968,MOM (CONT'D),968,"Just like your father did. But
not you, Ronnie. Look, whiskey
was always the way I dealt with
being a single mother, but as I
get older, I know that I can't
keep doing this. I've got
everything I need with you. So I
want you to know that I'm ready to
make a change. Your life needs to
get easier and you don't need to
take care of old Mom anymore."
969,RONNIE,969,Are you going to quit drinking?
970,MOM,970,"I'm switching to beer. I can
pound those all day and still keep
my shit together. I'm doing it
for you."
971,RONNIE,971,"I'm so proud of you, Mom."
972,MOM,972,"I'm proud of you. Now today is a
new day and we're going to get
through it. Now, get out there
and find what the world has in
store for you."
973,DENNIS,973,"What's up, Ronnie? How you doing?"
974,RONNIE,974,I've been better. You?
975,DENNIS,975,I'm holding it down in here.
976,RONNIE,976,"Yeah, I heard they finally caught
up with you."
977,DENNIS,977,"I know. I should have hit Mexico,
but, you know, I got stoned and
just kind of kicked with this girl
in Kannapolis for a while."
978,RONNIE,978,"You know they fired me when they
found out you were the one who
robbed the mall."
979,DENNIS,979,"Shit, dog.    Sorry about that."
980,RONNIE,980,"It's cool, but I need to know why
you did it."
981,DENNIS,981,I told you.   I'm an outlaw.
982,RONNIE,982,"Come on, Dennis."
983,DENNIS,983,"Man, you want to know the real
reason?"
984,RONNIE,984,Yeah.
985,DENNIS,985,"Alright, I'll tell you. Man, that
gig was one of the best jobs I
ever had. I got to wear a
uniform, I could smoke weed
whenever I wanted. For once in my
life, I felt like I was actually
somebody. I know most people
don't think it's shit, but I
really loved it. Then, all of a
sudden, I find out that your ass
got promoted over me."
986,DENNIS (CONT'D),986,"After all I put into it, you're
the one that makes it to Head of
Mall Security. You know what it's
like to get passed over, Ronnie?
So I got pissed off. I started
robbing the joint as a way to get
at them for what they did to me.
But you know what, Ronnie?"
987,RONNIE,987,What's that?
988,DENNIS,988,"You ever love a girl so much that
you can't break up with her, so
the only thing you can do when she
pisses you off is smack her in the
goddamn face?"
989,RONNIE,989,"No, Dennis, I haven't."
990,DENNIS,990,"Well, I have. And that's pretty
much how I felt about the job."
991,RONNIE,991,"Thanks for talking to me, Dennis."
992,DENNIS,992,"Well, it's the least I could do
after knocking you out and all."
993,DENNIS,993,"Hey, Ronnie."
994,RONNIE,994,"Yeah, Dennis."
995,DENNIS,995,"Bail me out of here, old friend."
996,RONNIE,996,"I can't do it, Dennis. You're now
a criminal who stopped caring, but
my crime is that I care too much."
997,CHARLES,997,"Ronnie, what are you doing back
here?"
998,RONNIE,998,"I just came to talk to Nell.
Don't get your panties in a wad,
I'm just here as any normal
patron."
999,CHARLES,999,"Ronnie, dude, I've been all fucked
up in the head. I feel like shit
about what happened. I mean, here
I am, just looking to shuck
responsibility and I ended up
hurting you in the process. Look,
I should have been honest with
you. I don't give two shits about
this stupid job. But you do."
1000,RONNIE,1000,"It's okay, Charles."
1001,CHARLES,1001,"I've decided I'm going back to
college. Getting stoned and
studying beats this any day. I
realize that now. I realize that
there aren't any jobs where you
can avoid hard choices. Anyway,
take as long as you want at the
mall. I'll keep Mark off your
back."
1002,RONNIE,1002,"Thanks, Charles."
1003,NELL,1003,"Ronnie, what are you doing here?"
1004,RONNIE,1004,I got something I want to say.
1005,NELL,1005,"I don't think we should be
talking."
1006,RONNIE,1006,"I'll be quick. Nell, this is the
only job I was ever any good at.
I'm not a crime solver or right
hand of the law. I'm just a dumb
guy in a uniform who can't even
become a real policeman.
Somewhere along the way I started
to think I was something special,
someone whose shit didn't stink,
someone who deserved to date out
of my league. You know, I've
learned. My shit does stink. It
smells horrible. And you're also
out of my league, but for some
reason, you like the smell of my
shit. I guess what I'm saying
is..."
1007,RONNIE,1007,"If you give me another chance,
I'll spend the rest of my life
making it up to you. And you can
call me sweetie in front of people
and I'll like it."
1008,RONNIE,1008,Son of a bitch!!!
1009,NELL,1009,"Oh, my God!"
1010,RONNIE,1010,Are you alright?
1011,NELL,1011,I'm fine.
1012,RONNIE,1012,"Shit, we should call somebody."
1013,NELL,1013,Ronnie.
1014,RONNIE,1014,Yeah?
1015,NELL,1015,Go get him.
1016,SADDAMN,1016,"What the fuck, man?!"
1017,RONNIE,1017,"Get out of the way! Get out of
the way!"
1018,RONNIE,1018,Stay the fuck away from my wife!
1019,STEVIE,1019,"Dude, that's fucking disgusting!"
1020,STEVIE,1020,"Hey, Ronnie, here!"
1021,STEVIE,1021,What a fucking douche!
1022,RONNIE,1022,"Okay, Ramon, we're fucking even!"
1023,RONNIE,1023,Turn it down.     Turn it down.
1024,MARK,1024,"Okay, show's over. Enjoy your
shopping experience at Carolina
Mall."
1025,MARK,1025,Jesus.
1026,MARK,1026,Charles!
1027,CHARLES,1027,What is it?
1028,MARK,1028,"Call the police. And go get
Ronnie."
1029,CHARLES,1029,He's trying to help.
1030,MARK,1030,Just do what I ask you.
1031,CHARLES,1031,"Hey, Ronnie!"
1032,RONNIE,1032,Fuck yeah!
1033,CHARLES,1033,"You want to report this to the
police."
1034,RONNIE,1034,"Hell no.   I'm taking him down
myself."
1035,MARK,1035,"Hey, Ronnie."
1036,MARK,1036,"Good job, Ronnie."
1037,RONNIE,1037,"Thank you, sir."
1038,BRANDI,1038,"Good job, Ronnie."
1039,RONNIE,1039,I don't love you!
1040,BRANDI,1040,I don't love you either.
1041,RONNIE,1041,Fine.
1042,RONNIE,1042,I caught the Pervert.
1043,DETECTIVE HARRISON,1043,"I see that. Well, you better turn
him over to me and I'll take him
inside and book him."
1044,RONNIE,1044,"Since you're a real Cop, right?"
1045,DETECTIVE HARRISON,1045,"Hey, Ronnie, you may not be an
officer of the law, but you're the
law's right hand. Good job."
1046,RONNIE,1046,What are you doing?!
1047,NELL,1047,You had an eyelash?
1048,RONNIE,1048,I'm trying to remember my speech.
1049,NELL,1049,Sorry.
1050,FEMALE REPORTER,1050,"Okay, Ronnie, we're ready for you."
1051,FEMALE REPORTER,1051,"Okay, we rolling?"
1052,CAMERAMAN,1052,Rolling.
1053,FEMALE REPORTER,1053,"Good evening. We're here today
with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of
Mall Security here at Carolina
Mall. Last week, Ronnie was able
to catch The CAROLINA MALL FLASHER
single-handed and bring him to
justice. Ronnie, how did you
manage to find the identity of The
Pervert and take him down?"
1054,RONNIE,1054,"Well, being a mall security guard
basically requires the same skill
set that someone in say the FBI
has. You have to use logic and
evidence and old-fashioned common
sense as well as the latest
technology to deduce the criminal
mind. It's what I do."
1055,FEMALE REPORTER,1055,"Any last words for the folks at
home."
1056,RONNIE,1056,"Yeah, I'd just like to say that
Carolina Mall is back on track and
safer than ever..."
1057,RONNIE,1057,"In fact, there are some wonderful
sales taking place right now."
1058,RONNIE,1058,"So for all you families out there,
come on down and see us. It's a
wonderful place."
1059,RONNIE,1059,"THAT'S IT, YOU LITTLE SHIT!"
1060,FEMALE REPORTER,1060,"You heard it, folks. Everything
is back to normal here at Carolina
Mall. Back to you, Lindsay."
