0,LEON,0,Okay if I talk?
1,LEON,1,"I kinda get nervous when I
take tests."
2,HOLDEN,2,Don't move.
3,LEON,3,Sorry.
4,LEON,4,"Already had I.Q. test this year --
but I don't think I never had a..."
5,HOLDEN,5,"Reaction time is a factor in this,
so please pay attention.  Answer
quickly as you can."
6,HOLDEN,6,"You're in a desert, walking along
in the sand when all of a sudden
you look down and see a..."
7,LEON,7,What one?
8,HOLDEN,8,What?
9,LEON,9,What desert?
10,HOLDEN,10,"Doesn't make any difference what
desert -- it's completely
hypothetical."
11,LEON,11,But how come I'd be there?
12,HOLDEN,12,"Maybe you're fed up, maybe you
want to be by yourself -- who
knows.  So you look down and
see a tortoise.  It's crawling
towards you..."
13,LEON,13,A tortoise.  What's that?
14,HOLDEN,14,Know what a turtle is?
15,LEON,15,Of course.
16,HOLDEN,16,Same thing.
17,LEON,17,I never seen a turtle.
18,LEON,18,But I understand what you mean.
19,HOLDEN,19,"You reach down and flip the
tortoise over on its back, Leon."
20,LEON,20,"You make these questions, Mr.
Holden, or they write 'em down
for you?"
21,HOLDEN,21,"The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the hot sun,
beating its legs trying to turn
itself over.  But it can't.  Not
without your help.  But you're
not helping."
22,LEON,22,"Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?"
23,HOLDEN,23,"I mean you're not helping!
Why is that, Leon?"
24,DECKARD (V.O.),24,"It was 97 degrees in the city and
no hope of improvement.  Not bad
if you're a lizard.  But two hours
earlier I was drinking Acquavit
with an Eskimo lady in North East
Alaska.  That's a tough change to
make.  It was so good, I didn't
want to leave, so I left a day
early."
25,DECKARD,25,"Contact.  This is Blade Runner One
calling Com-fast 27."
26,VOICE,26,"Blade Runner One, stand by please."
27,VOICE,27,Deckard.
28,DECKARD,28,"Yah, Gaff."
29,GAFF (VOICE),29,Where the hell you been?
30,DECKARD,30,"You know where I been.  I been on
vacation."
31,GAFF,31,"Next time you go on vacation,
do me a favor, let us know where
it is."
32,DECKARD,32,What's up?
33,GAFF,33,Holden got hit.
34,DECKARD,34,Bad?
35,GAFF,35,"Severed spine.  You'd better get
in here.  Bryant's waiting for you."
36,DECKARD,36,I'll see you in a minute.
37,DECKARD (V.O.),37,"I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6,
The Tyrell Corporation's new pride
and joy.  Holden was administering
the Voight-Kampff test when one
nailed him."
38,DECKARD (V.O.),38,"The Nexus-6 must be fast because
Holden was as quick as they come.
The report said there were six of
them.  Three males and three female.
Led by a combat model called Roy
Batty."
39,DECKARD (V.O.),39,"They escaped from the colonies
two weeks ago.  Killed twenty-
three people and jumped a shuttle.
An aerial patrol found the ship
in the desert.  No crew."
40,DECKARD (V.O.),40,"Bryant's got a liver problem.  A
couple years back he handed me a
bottle and said have a drink for
another man.  I been drinking
for him ever since."
41,DECKARD,41,"Six, huh?"
42,BRYANT,42,"Five.  Three nights ago one of
them managed to break into the
Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two
guards and got as far as the
Genetic Sector before he got
fried going through an electro-
field."
43,DECKARD,43,What was he after?
44,BRYANT,44,"There wasn't much left of him,
so we can't be sure.  But bio-
chemical data and morphology records
of the Nexus-6 were reported
missing.  Going on the possibility
they might try to infiltrate we
send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff
tests on the new employees.  Guess
he found himself one."
45,DECKARD,45,You got a machine on it yet?
46,BRYANT,46,"We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that
picked up Holden's alarm.  Its
guess is that all five are in
the city."
47,DECKARD,47,Where do we start?
48,BRYANT,48,"The Tyrell Corporation has a
demo model.  Check it out on the
Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance
the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability
to detect.  If that's the case,
everybody's up shit creek."
49,DECKARD,49,"What was the cover on the one that
got Holden?"
50,BRYANT,50,Industrial refuse.
51,DECKARD,51,Garbage man?
52,DECKARD,52,"Did personnel have an address on
him?"
53,DECKARD,53,I'll go take a look.
54,DECKARD,54,Thanks.
55,DECKARD (V.O.),55,"The big incentive to emigrate was
still free labor.  If the public
found out that their door-prizes
might kill them, they might not be
so hot to go up there.  This was
one of the worst one's we had and
Bryant was worried.  He wanted to
tell me to be discrete or something.
But I didn't give him a chance."
56,ANNOUNCER'S VOICE,56,"Choose from a variety of seventy
nine different personality types.
Each and every one a loyal trouble-
free companion given to you upon
your arrival absolutely free..."
57,ANNOUNCER'S VOICE,57,"To use as personal body servant
to tireless field hand -- the
custom tailored humanoid robot,
designed especially for your
needs."
58,BATTY,58,Did you get your precious 'things'?
59,LEON,59,Somebody was already there.
60,BATTY,60,Police.
61,LEON,61,Just a man.
62,BATTY,62,Police man.
63,BATTY,63,Why don't you have a seat.
64,BATTY,64,Enjoy the view.
65,CHEW,65,"Well, you're right.  This little
honey has a couple of defective cones."
66,CHEW,66,"You're a regular perfectionist,
Sebastian."
67,SEBASTIAN,67,"It's gotta be right for my
customer."
68,CHEW,68,"Your customer, eh?"
69,CHEW,69,"You got a pocket-charger, boy?"
70,CHEW,70,"Is that good enough for your
customer?"
71,CHEW,71,How much is he paying you?
72,CHEW,72,"Well, when do you get paid?"
73,SEBASTIAN,73,Soon as I finish the job.
74,CHEW,74,When might that be?
75,SEBASTIAN,75,Day after tomorrow.
76,CHEW,76,Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
77,CHEW,77,"The rich hate to pay, Sebastian.
A guy like Tyrell keeps you waiting.
Pay the little guy last.  You should
charge twice as much.  It'll make
him feel better."
78,SEBASTIAN,78,"Thanks, Mr. Chew."
79,SEBASTIAN,79,Hey!  You forgot your...
80,SEBASTIAN,80,How come you were in my truck?
81,PRIS,81,"I was tired and didn't have any
place to go."
82,SEBASTIAN,82,You can get back in if you want...
83,SEBASTIAN,83,"Don't worry, I won't hurt you."
84,SEBASTIAN,84,What's your name?
85,PRIS,85,Pris.
86,SEBASTIAN,86,Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
87,PRIS,87,Hi.
88,SEBASTIAN,88,Oh!  Where do you want to go?
89,SEBASTIAN,89,You want to go home?
90,PRIS,90,I don't have one.
91,SEBASTIAN,91,Oh.
92,SEBASTIAN,92,Where are your folks?
93,PRIS,93,They left.
94,SEBASTIAN,94,What about friends?
95,PRIS,95,"I have some, but I have to find
out where they are staying."
96,SEBASTIAN,96,"Well, where should I take you?"
97,PRIS,97,"We scared each other pretty good
didn't we?"
98,SEBASTIAN,98,We sure did.
99,PRIS,99,"I'm hungry, J.F."
100,SEBASTIAN,100,"I've got stuff.  If you wanna go
to my place?"
101,PRIS,101,I was hoping you'd say that.
102,DECKARD (V.O.),102,"Machines can be helpful sometimes,
but they can also be a pain in the
ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger
and you might wind up at a steel-
mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once
in a while -- it's their personalities
that usually get me.  Somebody once
said that man makes machines in his own
image.  If that's true, whoever made
Esper should have been shot."
103,ESPER,103,"This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go
ahead please."
104,DECKARD,104,You equipped for random questions?
105,ESPER,105,"Why, yes, of course."
106,DECKARD,106,You start.
107,ESPER,107,"The five in question are third
generation Nexus Sixes, constructed
of skin-flesh culture, selected
enogenic transfer conversion
capable of self-perpetuating
thought, para-physical abilities
and developed for emigration
program.  Are you with me?"
108,DECKARD,108,How do I stop one?
109,ESPER,109,"Unlike a five, they can sustain
massive traumas to several parts
of the body without debilitating
another.  Sever a leg and it will
perform quicker on the remaining leg
than the fastest man can run,"
110,DECKARD,110,"Okay, but..."
111,ESPER,111,"I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable
zone is the base of the skull,
the occipital bone.  A direct hit
is a positive retirement."
112,VOICE,112,"You are in violation of traffic
ordinance M-139 statutory freeway
limit restricted by one-hundred
and eighty kilometers."
113,SEBASTIAN,113,Oh!
114,PRIS,114,Whatcha doin'?
115,SEBASTIAN,115,You scared me.
116,SEBASTIAN,116,I'm working.
117,SEBASTIAN,117,You look... better.
118,PRIS,118,Just better.
119,SEBASTIAN,119,Beautiful.
120,PRIS,120,Thanks.
121,PRIS,121,"And you live in this building all
by yourself?"
122,SEBASTIAN,122,"Yeah, I live here pretty much
alone right now..."
123,SEBASTIAN,123,"No housing shortage around here...
plenty of room for everybody."
124,PRIS,124,How old are you?
125,SEBASTIAN,125,Twenty.
126,PRIS,126,What's your problem?
127,SEBASTIAN,127,Methuselah Syndrome.
128,PRIS,128,What's that?
129,SEBASTIAN,129,My glands.  They grow old too fast.
130,PRIS,130,Is that why you're still here?
131,SEBASTIAN,131,Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
132,PRIS,132,I like you just the way you are.
133,SEBASTIAN,133,"Ah, you get hold of your friends?"
134,PRIS,134,"As a matter of fact I did.  They've
got some work to do tonight, but
they're gonna come tomorrow."
135,SEBASTIAN,135,Good.
136,SEBASTIAN,136,I can sleep on the couch.
137,MOUSE,137,Don't let the bed bugs bite!
138,ESPER,138,"Nexus designated Leon:  incept

used in military experiments to
determine how hyper metabolism
functions in deep space.
Nexus designated Batty incept

model, level of self-sufficiency,
optimum."
139,ESPER,139,"Here's something you might find
interesting.  They have been built
to emulate the human in every way
except in its emotional spectrum.
However, after a period of time
it is only logical that such a
'mechanism' would create its own
emotional responses, hate, love,
fear, anger, envy."
140,DECKARD,140,I know all that.
141,ESPER,141,What about a summary then.
142,DECKARD,142,I think we're through for the night.
143,ESPER,143,Mr. Deckard.
144,DECKARD,144,Yes?
145,ESPER,145,"Do you have something against
science?"
146,DECKARD,146,Not if it works.
147,ESPER,147,And what in your estimation works?
148,DECKARD,148,The umbrella.
149,DECKARD (V.O.),149,"Every government that could was
racing to populate their colonial
territory.  But emigrants needed
incentive.  Over-population and
the greenhouse factor didn't seem
to be enough; but owning a human
look-a-like had lots of appeal.
It was big industry, the competition
was stiff and Tyrell was top of the
line."
150,DECKARD (V.O.),150,"His claim to fame was making a
product more human than human and
sometimes the 'more' turned out to
be a problem.  This wasn't just an
escaped andy who broke his owner's
arm -- there were twenty-eight
people dead and the pressure was
on."
151,DECKARD (V.O.),151,"But so far they'd always managed
to keep it quiet.  Not to say
that once in a while there wasn't
bad publicity.  Some fanatic
bitching about equal rights for
andies or an occasional trade union
proclaiming it was aun-American for
automatons to take jobs away from
humans on the colony."
152,DECKARD (V.O.),152,"But what's more American than good
old supply and demand?  The
Government needed them, industry
made them and the church backed
them.  The big religious boys
said that Androids, no matter how
human, were objects; only God
could make people. I'm not religious,
but I was inclined to agree.
Otherwise I'd be out of a job."
153,RACHAEL,153,"Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is
Rachael."
154,RACHAEL,154,"It seems your department doesn't
believe out new unit is to the
public benefit."
155,DECKARD,155,"A humanoid robot is like any other
machine, it can be a benefit or a
hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's
not our problem."
156,RACHAEL,156,"But because your department can't
do an adequate job in detecting
the miniscule number at large,
it's a problem.  Correct, Mr.
Deckard?"
157,RACHAEL,157,You like our owl?
158,DECKARD,158,It's artificial?
159,RACHAEL,159,Of course not.
160,RACHAEL,160,"You're in a very unique position,
Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the
future of this entire organization
according to how you work your
little test."
161,RACHAEL,161,Are you apprehensive?
162,DECKARD,162,Why should I be?
163,RACHAEL,163,"For the responsibility of your
power.  Being a police bureaucrat,
you've got more than your share."
164,DECKARD,164,"You got it wrong, girl.  I work
with the bureau not for them."
165,DECKARD,165,"My job isn't to detect
malfunctioning andies, it's to
eliminate them.  The more the
better."
166,RACHAEL,166,Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
167,TYRELL,167,"How do you do, Mr. Deckard.  Please
sit down.  Would you care for a cup
of coffee?"
168,DECKARD,168,Thanks.
169,TYRELL,169,Black?
170,DECKARD,170,Please.
171,TYRELL,171,"Somehow, I didn't expect that the
man who did the dirty work would
be the man to do the technical
work.  Here you are, Mr. Deckard."
172,TYRELL,172,Is this to be an empathy test?
173,DECKARD,173,Yes.
174,TYRELL,174,"Capillary dilation of the so-called
blush response?  Plus fluctuation
of the pupil, plus involuntary
dilation of the iris?"
175,TYRELL,175,May I ask a personal question?
176,DECKARD,176,Go ahead.
177,TYRELL,177,"Have you ever retired a human by
mistake?"
178,DECKARD,178,No.
179,TYRELL,179,"But in your profession that is a
risk."
180,DECKARD,180,"Nothing is infallible, but so far
the Voight-Kampff scale bas been
foolproof."
181,TYRELL,181,"Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a
machine can be a hazard.  The
Voight-Kampff scale is a machine,
isn't it?"
182,DECKARD,182,"One that relies on human
interpretation.  Where's the
subject?"
183,TYRELL,183,Sitting next to you.
184,DECKARD'S VOICE,184,Ready.
185,RACHAEL,185,Go ahead.
186,DECKARD,186,"You're given a calfskin wallet
for your birthday."
187,RACHAEL,187,"I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd
report the person who gave it to
me to the police."
188,DECKARD,188,"You have a little boy.  He shows
you his butterfly collection, plus
the killing jar."
189,RACHAEL,189,I'd take him to the doctor.
190,DECKARD,190,"You're watching T.V. and suddenly
you notice a wasp crawling on your
wrist."
191,RACHAEL,191,I'd kill it.
192,DECKARD,192,"In a magazine you come across a
full-page photo of a nude girl."
193,RACHAEL,193,"Is this testing whether I'm an
android or a lesbian?"
194,DECKARD,194,"You show the picture to your husband.
He likes it and hangs it on the wall.
The girl is lying on a bearskin rug."
195,RACHEL,195,I wouldn't let him.
196,DECKARD,196,Why not?
197,RACHAEL,197,I should be enough for him.
198,DECKARD,198,"You become pregnant by a man who
runs off with your best friend,
and you decide to get an abortion."
199,RACHAEL,199,I'd never get an abortion.
200,DECKARD,200,Why not?
201,RACHAEL,201,"That would be murder, Mr. Deckard."
202,DECKARD,202,In your opinion.
203,RACHAEL,203,It would be my child.
204,DECKARD,204,"Sounds like you speaks from
experience."
205,DECKARD,205,"Last question.  You're watching
an old movie.  It shows a banquet in
progress, the guests are enjoying
raw oysters."
206,RACHAEL,206,Ugh.
207,DECKARD,207,"The entree consists of boiled
dog stuffed with rice."
208,DECKARD,208,"The raw oysters are less acceptable
to you than a dish of boiled dog."
209,DECKARD,209,Lights please.
210,TYRELL,210,Well?
211,DECKARD,211,"If she is, the machine works."
212,TYRELL,212,The machine works.  She is.
213,TYRELL,213,How many questions did it take?
214,DECKARD,214,Thirteen.
215,DECKARD,215,She didn't know?
216,TYRELL,216,"Memory implant.  She was programmed.
But I think she has transcended
her conditioning.  I think she was
beginning to suspect."
217,TYRELL,217,"How many questions does it usually
take, Mr. Deckard?"
218,DECKARD,218,"Five, maybe six."
219,TYRELL,219,"You're going to have to be on your
toes, my friend."
220,TYRELL,220,"It's a complex problem and we
wouldn't want anything to happen
to you."
221,TYRELL,221,"For the good of all, I recommend
you take Rachael with you.
Considering her uniqueness, I'm
sure she could prove quite helpful."
222,DECKARD,222,No thanks.
223,TYRELL,223,"And how is it one man will be able
to cover so much ground?"
224,DECKARD,224,Discreetly.
225,TYRELL,225,"All pertinent information is
being fed into your departmental
computer, an Esper 231 -- I
believe -- and a photo over-lay
packet is being produced."
226,TYRELL,226,"Mr. Deckard, I think it would be
wise to reconsider my offer."
227,DECKARD,227,I work alone.
228,VOICE,228,"Let's keep our eyes on the road,
Deckard."
229,DECKARD'S VOICE,229,Sorry.
230,VOICE,230,"Come on, stay with the machine."
231,VOICE,231,"We're going to have to start the
sequence again if you don't stay
with me, Deckard.  Concentrate."
232,DECKARD'S VOICE,232,How do you know I'm not?
233,VOICE,233,"You're not responding to the
stimulus.  I can see right here,
I'm not getting a reading."
234,DECKARD'S VOICE,234,I'm tired of this.
235,VOICE,235,Almost through.
236,DECKARD,236,So how did I do?
237,WHEELER,237,Nerves of steel.
238,DECKARD,238,No rust?
239,WHEELER,239,"I didn't say that.  Your motivity
rate checked out a little slower
than last time."
240,DECKARD,240,Meaning?
241,WHEELER,241,"Meaning you don't run as fast as
you used to."
242,WHEELER,242,During the road test...
243,DECKARD,243,Yeah?
244,WHEELER,244,"Your mind kept wandering.  That
bothered me."
245,DECKARD,245,Huh huh.
246,WHEELER,246,"Considering the nature of your
work, that could be unhealthy."
247,DECKARD,247,True.
248,WHEELER,248,You got a birthday coming up.
249,WHEELER,249,"But you haven't put in for
emigration."
250,DECKARD,250,Nope.
251,WHEELER,251,You're going to be over the limit.
252,DECKARD,252,"Listen, I could make you a long
list of complaints about this
fucken city but I still rather be
here than up there."
253,WHEELER,253,What if you change your mind?
254,DECKARD,254,"They'll change the limit before
I change my mind."
255,WHEELER,255,You sure?
256,DECKARD,256,"Never been more sure of anything
in my life."
257,DECKARD,257,Why didn't you go?
258,WHEELER,258,Too old.
259,DECKARD,259,But if you could?
260,WHEELER,260,My job is here.
261,DECKARD,261,Me too.
262,BATTY,262,What's going on down there?
263,PRIS,263,He's not ready yet.
264,BATTY,264,When?
265,PRIS,265,"Tomorrow, he says."
266,RACHAEL,266,Was that your dinner?
267,RACHAEL,267,"I'm sorry.  I called and found out
you were on your way home.  These
were already delivered to your
department but I thought you
should have copies as soon as
possible."
268,RACHAEL,268,"It's the Nexus information you
wanted."
269,DECKARD,269,Thanks.
270,DECKARD,270,Is there anything else?
271,RACHAEL,271,"I know you think it complicates
your work, but I'm here to help."
272,DECKARD,272,"I've already got more help than
I need."
273,RACHAEL,273,"I think you need more help than
you've got."
274,RACHAEL,274,"There's two reasons a man rejects
help.  Either because he's so good
at what he does he doesn't think
he needs it, or he's so insecure
he can't admit it."
275,DECKARD,275,"Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either
way, but the answer is still no."
276,RACHAEL,276,"Two of us might be more effective
than one."
277,DECKARD,277,I work alone.
278,RACHAEL,278,No you don't.
279,RACHAEL,279,"You use your equipment, don't you?"
280,DECKARD,280,So?
281,RACHAEL,281,"So, I'm a piece of equipment.
Use me."
282,DECKARD,282,"That's okay, I'll get it..."
283,RACHAEL,283,Do I make you nervous?
284,DECKARD,284,Yeah.
285,RACHAEL,285,I'm sorry.
286,RACHAEL,286,"It's strange to suddenly realize
that what you thought was your
life is actually someone else's
fabrication."
287,DECKARD,287,I can imagine.
288,RACHAEL,288,Can you?  I couldn't.
289,RACHAEL,289,"A part of me is glad.  I think I
feel more.  I don't like who I was
before."
290,DECKARD,290,"So why do you think they were
after their records."
291,RACHAEL,291,"They probably want to find out
when they were made."
292,DECKARD,292,Right.
293,RACHAEL,293,"I guess the date of your birth is
important if you know you're not
made to last."
294,RACHAEL,294,That's my number.  If you need me.
295,RACHAEL,295,"You better get better locks --
if you want to keep me out."
296,RACHAEL,296,Good night.
297,DECKARD,297,Night.
298,DECKARD (V.O.),298,"The possibilities were infinite.
They could change their appearances
but not their future.
Like she said, it was short.
Longevity is what they were after.
The garbage man even wanted a past.
Poor fuck.  I'd check it out but
I knew she was right.  The market
worked on turn-over.  Built-in
obsolescence was the name of the
game.  That meant her too.  It
was something I didn't want to
think about."
299,DECKARD,299,Yeah.
300,BRYANT,300,"Bryant here.  Regarding the
rundown you requested on job
applicants, Esper's concluded that
the only irregular category that
Tyrell's got is the entertainment
section.  You better get on it."
301,DECKARD,301,I was just about to have my dinner.
302,BRYANT,302,"If you hurry you'll get back
before it gets cold.  I got a
spinner on your roof in five
minutes.  Good luck."
303,EPSER,303,"Nexus designated Rachael is a
prototype.  Created for in-house
use by special mandate form the
Scientific Development Regulatory
Committee.  Will live conventional
term -- no para-physical abilities."
304,DECKARD,304,What is a conventional term?
305,ESPER,305,"Four years.  Which would make her
termination date..."
306,DECKARD,306,"Never mind.  Do they have that
knowledge?"
307,ESPER,307,Longevity is classified.  No.
308,DECKARD,308,"Okay, gimme a run-down on the
three females."
309,ESPER,309,"Nexus designated Mary:  incept
November 1 2017, domestic
conditioning non competitive,
trained for day care position."
310,DECKARD,310,Next.
311,ESPER,311,"Nexus designated Pris:  incept
data December 13 2017, competitive,
programmed to provide pleasure
for long term spacers."
312,DECKARD,312,Number three.
313,ESPER,313,"Nexus designated Zhora:  incept
June 13th 2017, athletic
conditioning, highly competitive,
special abilities in the
entertainment field."
314,DECKARD,314,Fuck.
315,DECKARD,315,Taffey Lewis?
316,TAFFEY,316,Yes?
317,DECKARD,317,Can I come in?
318,TAFFEY,318,"Excuse my niece there... She's
studying for an exam."
319,DECKARD,319,"I'd like  you to take a look at
these pictures."
320,TAFFEY,320,Of course.
321,TAFFEY,321,"You see I lost my contacts a
couple of days ago around here
somewhere and my sight is a
little... What am I supposed
to be looking for?"
322,DECKARD,322,"Do you recognize any of
them?"
323,TAFFEY,323,"This one looks familiar, but
I don't know.  Naw.  There's
one came in today looks a
little like this one but..."
324,DECKARD,324,What did she want?
325,TAFFEY,325,Who?
326,DECKARD,326,"The girl that doesn't look
like that girl."
327,TAFFEY,327,"Nothing.  She wanted to know
about suck night."
328,DECKARD,328,What night?
329,TAFFEY,329,"I didn't know if I wanted to
handle her -- I already got
a snake act.  But my partner
goes down there to the Opera
House on suck night to book
the good ones."
330,DECKARD,330,What's suck night?
331,TAFFEY,331,"That's what we call in the
trade, audition free-for-
alls and most of it sucks.
Bit I don't think that's
her."
332,DECKARD,332,"You talking about the Opera
House on the Main?"
333,DECKARD,333,Book the good ones for where?
334,TAFFEY,334,"Lots of places.  The tours,
the clubs, the Silicone shows,
private parties."
335,DECKARD,335,What shows?
336,TAFFEY,336,"Silicone Valley.  Lots of
these science guys never
leave that place.  We book
two shows a month in there.
Those big time techs and bio-
guys might be real high zoners
up here, but when it comes
to the arts, they like it loud
and lewd."
337,ANNOUNCER'S VOICE,337,"Let's hear it for the Hermano
Brothers."
338,ANNOUNCER'S VOICE,338,"Next we're gonna see a little
charmer who keeps her dancing
partner in a basket!  She
comes to us all the way from
exotic Casablanca.  'Salome.'"
339,DECKARD,339,"Excuse me, Miss Salome."
340,DECKARD,340,"I'd like to have a word with you
if I could."
341,SALOME,341,Yeah?
342,DECKARD,342,"I'm with the American Federation
of Variety Artists..."
343,DECKARD,343,"Don't worry, I'm not here to make
you join -- that's not my department."
344,DECKARD,344,"I'm an investigator for the
Confidential Committee on Moral
Abuses."
345,DECKARD,345,"There's been reports of management
sexually abusing the artists in
this place."
346,SALOME,346,I don't know nothing about it.
347,DECKARD,347,"You haven't felt yourself to be
exploited by the management in any
way?"
348,SALOME,348,How do you mean 'exploited'?
349,DECKARD,349,"Like to get this position.  Did
you or were you asked to do anything
lewd or unsavory or otherwise
repulsive to your person?"
350,SALOME,350,Are you for real?
351,DECKARD,351,"Oh, yeah.
You'd be surprised what goes on
around here.  I'd like to check
the dressing room if I could."
352,SALOME,352,What the fuck for?
353,DECKARD,353,For holes.
354,SALOME,354,I don't believe this.
355,DECKARD,355,It that mother real?
356,SALOME,356,"Of course he's not real.  You think
I'd be working here if I could
afford a real snake?"
357,DECKARD,357,It's a good job.
358,SALOME,358,You mean the snake.
359,SALOME,359,The best.
360,DECKARD,360,Does it eat?
361,SALOME,361,Come on.
362,SALOME,362,Jeezus!
363,DECKARD,363,Sorry.
364,SALOME,364,"Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck
mine, huh?"
365,DECKARD,365,"They have their ways of doing
their dirty work without the
victim knowing what's going on."
366,DECKARD,366,"You'd be surprised what a guy'll
go through to get a glimpse of a
beautiful body."
367,SALOME,367,I bet I would.
368,DECKARD,368,"Little dirty holes the bastards
drill in the wall so they can
watch a lady undress."
369,SALOME,369,"And what if somebody did try to
'exploit' me?  Who do I go to?"
370,DECKARD,370,Me.
371,SALOME,371,And who do I go to about you?
372,DECKARD,372,Hmmmmm?
373,ZHORA,373,"You ever get the feeling things
aren't the way they seem?"
374,DECKARD,374,Stop or you're dead!
375,COP,375,Drop it!
376,SERGEANT,376,On your belly!
377,DECKARD,377,"Listen, Sergeant..."
378,COP,378,"Hey, Sarge, this guy's a cop."
379,SERGEANT,379,Clear this fuckin' crowd.
380,BRYANT,380,"Just because it's a Nexus 6 doesn't
change procedure.  A little known
fact can become a well-known fact
and part of our job, Deckard, is
to make sure that doesn't happen.
Now how can be do that if you blow
one away in front of a fuckin'
audience."
381,BRYANT,381,Well?
382,DECKARD,382,She was gonna get away.
383,BRYANT,383,"Then let her get away.  I thought
you were a pro -- you're supposed
to be a fuckin' tracker!"
384,BRYANT,384,"I'd say you got a little carried
away."
385,DECKARD,385,I didn't like her.
386,BRYANT,386,You didn't like her!?
387,BRYANT,387,"You start liking or disliking
andies it's time to hang it up."
388,BRYANT,388,"Look, go home.  Get some rest.
Take an aspirin."
389,DECKARD,389,Yeah.
390,BARTENDER,390,"I can't protect your drinks,
mister; while you was in the
potty, this hummer snatched it."
391,DECKARD,391,No problem.  Gimme another.
392,RUSSIAN,392,"Forgive me.  I thought was free
drink.  I will pay."
393,DECKARD,393,Forget it.
394,LEON,394,I think I have no money.
395,DECKARD,395,It's okay.  Forget it.
396,LEON,396,But I would like to buy you drink.
397,DECKARD,397,"I'll but you one.  What'll you
have?"
398,LEON,398,Vodka!
399,DECKARD,399,"Shot of vodka, please."
400,LEON,400,Thank you very much.
401,DECKARD,401,My pleasure.
402,LEON,402,Prosit.
403,DECKARD,403,Prosit.
404,LEON,404,You want to see my friends?
405,DECKARD,405,"Sorry, don't have the time."
406,LEON,406,No problem.
407,DECKARD,407,Those cockroaches?
408,LEON,408,Ya.
409,DECKARD,409,How long you had these guys?
410,LEON,410,"Two months.  But this one is not
guy.  It is girl.  His girl."
411,LEON,411,"Usually Blackie waits until Igor
is eating; then, when his back is
turned, he tries to take advantage
of Anna."
412,LEON,412,Prosit.
413,DECKARD,413,Prosit.
414,LEON,414,"You never saw a cockroach make
love?"
415,LEON,415,We will try.
416,LEON,416,"It must be that he is not hungry
or maybe she is not hot."
417,LEON,417,You like to kiss her goodbye.
418,DECKARD,418,No thanks.
419,BARTENDER,419,"Make sure you take your girlfriends
with you when you leave."
420,LEON,420,I like you.
421,DECKARD,421,I like you too.
422,LEON,422,"One more, eh?"
423,DECKARD,423,I gotta piss.
424,DECKARD,424,I think I'll piss outside.
425,LEON,425,"How come you know where Zhora was
so quick?"
426,DECKARD,426,"I showed pictures.  Somebody
recognized her.  I went to see."
427,LEON,427,How old am I?
428,DECKARD,428,I don't know.
429,LEON,429,"My birthday is April 10, 2015.
How long do I live?"
430,DECKARD,430,Four years.
431,LEON,431,More than you.
432,LEON,432,"Painful to live in fear, isn't it."
433,LEON,433,"But that's how it is to be a
slave.  The future is sealed off,
he grovels, he waits."
434,LEON,434,"Sex, reproduction, security, the
simple things.  But no way to
satisfy them.  To be homesick
with no place to go.  Potential
with no way to use it.  Lots of
little oversights in the Nexus 6."
435,LEON,435,"I tell you, nothing is worse
than having an itch you can never
scratch."
436,DECKARD,436,"Like I said, I don't need your
help."
437,RACHAEL,437,"You look terrible, you know that?"
438,DECKARD (V.O.),438,"I knew a cop once who was involved
in a high-speed chase.  They shot
out one of his tires and he went
over a cliff at hundred and fifty
miles an hour.  They found him in
the morning with a broken skull,
six fractured ribs and second-
degree burns.  On the way to the
hospital he made a play for the
nurse."
439,DECKARD,439,"Hey!  I thought you were supposed
to be taking care of me."
440,RACHAEL'S VOICE,440,What do you need?
441,DECKARD,441,"Don't just stand there looking at
me.  It's not polite."
442,RACHAEL,442,What do you want me to do?
443,DECKARD,443,Sit.
444,DECKARD,444,Gimme your arm.
445,DECKARD,445,"You ever take a bath with a man
before?"
446,RACHAEL,446,"There's a lot I haven't done with
a man before."
447,RACHAEL,447,You're getting me wet.
448,RACHAEL'S VOICE,448,"Sorry, I am not in at the moment,
but if you'll leave your name and
number I'll return your call as
soon as I can."
449,DECKARD,449,"Fuck you, then."
450,SEBASTIAN,450,Mr. Deetchum?  Hello?
451,SEBASTIAN,451,"Now, now, Waddles."
452,SEBASTIAN,452,"Hello, Wrigley."
453,SEBASTIAN,453,"Mr. Deetchum isn't taking very
good care of you people."
454,BATTY,454,Whoops.
455,PRIS,455,"This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian."
456,BATTY,456,"Hello, glad to meet you."
457,PRIS,457,And my Aunt Mary.
458,PRIS,458,"And this is my savior, J.F. Sebastian,
everybody."
459,BATTY,459,"Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian.
If you hadn't come along..."
460,MARY,460,"We were worried to death.  It's
awfully kind of you."
461,BATTY,461,"We're not used to the big city.
Where we come from it's not so
easy to get lost."
462,MARY,462,"You certainly have a nice place
here."
463,BATTY,463,Well stocked.
464,PRIS,464,"Sebastian doesn't like to go out
too much."
465,SEBASTIAN,465,"I keep a lot of provisions right
here."
466,BATTY,466,"I like a man who stays put.  An
admirable thing to be able to
sustain yourself in these times.
You live here all by yourself, do
you?"
467,SEBASTIAN,467,"Well, no, not really.  There's
Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman,
he lives on the first floor."
468,MARY,468,"We haven't found it easy, Mr.
Sebastian."
469,SEBASTIAN,469,"How about breakfast, I was just
going to make some."
470,BATTY,470,"If it wouldn't be too much of a
bother... a little bite to eat
would be..."
471,SEBASTIAN,471,"Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to."
472,BATTY,472,"Well, actually"
473,MARY,473,We're famished.
474,SEBASTIAN,474,"Okay, then.  You make yourselves
comfortable and I'll bring the
food right out."
475,BATTY,475,Charming.
476,PRIS,476,Well?
477,PRIS,477,I want to know what's going on.
478,BATTY,478,There's only three of us left.
479,PRIS,479,Then we're stupid and we'll die.
480,BATTY,480,"Not if everybody is doing their
job here at home.  How are things
at home?"
481,PIG,481,"Home again, jiggidy jig."
482,PRIS,482,"I don't trust him.  I don't think
he knows what he's doing."
483,BATTY,483,He knows what he's doing.
484,MARY,484,If he won't cooperate?
485,BATTY,485,"Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants
to be appreciated.  We'll
appreciate him and he'll cooperate."
486,DECKARD,486,"How are you doing, old man?"
487,HOLDEN,487,"I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm
not really great, but I feel just
great.  How you like my new suit?"
488,DECKARD,488,"Well, you don't have to worry
about getting it wrinkled."
489,HOLDEN,489,"Don't make me laugh.  It makes me
pee."
490,DECKARD,490,Sorry.
491,HOLDEN,491,"Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee.
So how are you doing?"
492,DECKARD,492,I'm doing okay.
493,HOLDEN,493,"From what I hear you're doing
great.  Bryant tells me you're
going like a god damn one-man
army.  Making a lot of money, huh?"
494,DECKARD,494,Yeah.
495,DECKARD,495,"But that's what I wanted to talk
to you about."
496,HOLDEN,496,Money?
497,DECKARD,497,No.  I got a problem.
498,HOLDEN,498,Let's hear it.
499,DECKARD,499,"I think I'm starting to empathize
with these Nexus-sixes."
500,DECKARD,500,What's that?
501,HOLDEN,501,I'm taking a piss.
502,HOLDEN,502,"Let me ask you something, Deck.
You been having intimate relations
with one of these units?"
503,HOLDEN,503,"That's what I thought... one of
the liabilities of the trade --
you has sex with your prey, old
buddy.  That's bound to create
problems, unless you're a black
widow."
504,DECKARD,504,What about -- not sex -- but love?
505,HOLDEN,505,"Love is just another name for sex.
Love is sexy and sex is lovely --
I don't care what you call it, an
android can't have it."
506,DECKARD,506,These aren't just...
507,HOLDEN,507,"I know what they are, Deck --
Look, maybe they can pretend to
feel, but far as the raw, hot
emotions of the old heart -- no
way."
508,HOLDEN,508,"Believe me, take it from an old
pro, no matter how good we get,
we're never gonna make an
artificial anything that can
feel.  It's a contradiction.
You might as well go fuck your
washing machine."
509,HOLDEN,509,"Just go out there and keep up
the good work."
510,HOLDEN,510,"Got to save it, Deck, I'm getting
sleepy.  It's been good talking
to you."
511,DECKARD,511,Thanks.
512,RACHAEL,512,I told you I'd come back.
513,DECKARD,513,You did?
514,RACHAEL,514,"You didn't hear me.  You were
sleeping."
515,RACHAEL,515,Are you glad I'm here?
516,RACHAEL,516,Who is this?
517,DECKARD,517,Me and my dad.
518,RACHAEL,518,Where is he?
519,DECKARD,519,Dead.
520,RACHAEL,520,Oh.
521,RACHAEL,521,How come you're not on the job?
522,DECKARD,522,"I am.  Part of my job is to sit
on a couch and try and figure
things out."
523,RACHAEL,523,How are you doing?
524,DECKARD,524,Not too good.
525,RACHAEL,525,What do people do in the afternoon?
526,DECKARD,526,"If they are smart, they take
naps."
527,RACHAEL,527,Do you dream?
528,DECKARD,528,Yeah.  Sometimes.
529,RACHAEL,529,I wish I could.
530,DECKARD,530,Wishing is a kind of dreaming.
531,RACHAEL,531,I mean asleep.
532,RACHAEL,532,"Did you cry when your father
died?"
533,DECKARD,533,Yeah.
534,RACHAEL,534,"That's another thing I can't
do."
535,RACHAEL,535,"Nobody is freer than when he
dreams.  I read that."
536,DECKARD,536,"It wasn't very good last night,
was it?"
537,RACHAEL,537,"I don't know, I have nothing
to compare it to.  I guess I
thought there was something
more to it."
538,DECKARD,538,What?
539,RACHAEL,539,"I don't know... I think I missed
something."
540,DECKARD,540,Like?
541,RACHAEL,541,"I'm not sure.  Is there a
secret?"
542,DECKARD,542,"I don't know.  If there is I'd
like to find it."
543,BATTY,543,Why are you staring at us?
544,SEBASTIAN,544,You're just all so... so different.
545,BATTY,545,"What, Sebastian?"
546,SEBASTIAN,546,You're androids.
547,PRIS,547,What makes you think so?
548,SEBASTIAN,548,You're all so perfect.
549,SEBASTIAN,549,What generation are you?
550,BATTY,550,Nexus - 6.
551,BATTY,551,"We can trust Sebastian, ladies.
He's been working with mechanisms
all his life.  He's a wizard and
a very perceptive man."
552,SEBASTIAN,552,Could you...
553,SEBASTIAN,553,Show me something?
554,BATTY,554,Like what?
555,SEBASTIAN,555,Like...
556,BATTY,556,"We're not computers, Sebastian,
we're physical."
557,PRIS,557,"I think, therefore I am."
558,BATTY,558,"Very good, Pris.  Now show him why."
559,BATTY,559,We have a lot in common.
560,SEBASTIAN,560,"You mean that you can't come here
and I can't go there?"
561,BATTY,561,"Not only that, but we have smiliar
problems.  Accelerated decrepitude.
But we don't want to die quite yet."
562,SEBASTIAN,562,Of course not.
563,BATTY,563,You could help us.
564,SEBASTIAN,564,"I don't know much about biomechanics,
Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out
of my league."
565,BATTY,565,"If we don't find help soon, Pris
hasn't got long to live."
566,BATTY,566,"What about your friend, the man
who owns this building?"
567,SEBASTIAN,567,Dr. Tyrell?
568,SEBASTIAN,568,"He's not really my friend.  I just
do a job for him now and then."
569,BATTY,569,"Tyrell could help us, Sebastian."
570,SEBASTIAN,570,He could?
571,BATTY,571,His company made us.
572,SEBASTIAN,572,I'd be happy to mention it to him.
573,BATTY,573,"Be better if I could talk to him
in person.  But he's not an easy
man to get to."
574,SEBASTIAN,574,No.
575,BATTY,575,When do you deliver your project?
576,SEBASTIAN,576,This afternoon.
577,BATTY,577,Will you help us?
578,SEBASTIAN,578,Yes.
579,BATTY,579,"I'm sure glad you found us,
Sebastian.  What do you think,
Mary?"
580,MARY,580,"I don't think there is another
human being in this whole world
who would have helped us."
581,BATTY,581,Pris?
582,BATTY,582,You're our best and only friend.
583,SEBASTIAN,583,Thank you.
584,RACHAEL,584,"When was the last time you cleaned
this place?"
585,DECKARD,585,Hmmm?
586,RACHAEL,586,"Have you ever cleaned your
apartment?"
587,DECKARD,587,Don't be fooled by appearances.
588,RACHAEL,588,"It appears to be dirty -- why don't
you get somebody?"
589,DECKARD,589,"Because they would ruin the
arrangement."
590,RACHAEL,590,"They could clean around the
arrangement."
591,DECKARD,591,"I don't like people snooping around
my stuff."
592,DECKARD'S VOICE,592,"There's a vacuum in the front room
closet is you wanna give it a try."
593,DECKARD,593,"Oh no, don't do that."
594,RACHAEL,594,"But if I don't plug it in how can
I..."
595,DECKARD,595,"Never mind the plug, just go
through the motions."
596,RACHAEL,596,But then how can you...
597,DECKARD,597,"I don't like the noise.  Just
practice.  Practice makes perfect."
598,DECKARD,598,"I'm serious.  Go ahead.  Show me
how you would do it."
599,DECKARD,599,"How about under the couch there.
Come on."
600,RACHAEL,600,This feels stupid.
601,DECKARD,601,"Good for a smart girl to feel
stupid.  Part of your education."
602,RACHAEL,602,"You're sick, Deckard."
603,DECKARD,603,I never felt better.
604,STYLES,604,"Okay, I'll take that now."
605,SEBASTIAN,605,Wait!
606,SEBASTIAN,606,Can't fly without the pilot.
607,IAN,607,Oh!
608,IAN,608,Papa!  Did you make this?
609,TYRELL,609,"No.  We can make man, but not a
griffon."
610,TYRELL,610,"Have to give the cottage industry
a chance too."
611,TYRELL,611,"A friend of yours, Sebastian?"
612,SEBASTIAN,612,"Yes, this is someone who wants to
talk to you, Dr. Tyrell."
613,BATTY,613,The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
614,TYRELL,614,Oh?
615,BATTY,615,"To act without understanding could
lead to the very thing the act
seeks to avoid."
616,BATTY,616,A little talk it all I need.
617,TYRELL,617,"Would you like to talk in private
then."
618,BATTY,618,"Yeah.  It might be better if we
talk in private, Sebastian.  Why
don't you go home."
619,TYRELL,619,"Here's your check, my boy.  Thank
you."
620,SEBASTIAN,620,"Thank you, Dr. Tyrell.  I'll see
you later."
621,SEBASTIAN,621,Was everything okay?
622,TYRELL,622,Just beautiful.
623,TYRELL,623,"I'm surprised you didn't come to
me sooner."
624,BATTY,624,"It's not an easy thing to meet
your maker."
625,TYRELL,625,And what can he do for you?
626,BATTY,626,Can the maker repair what he makes?
627,TYRELL,627,Would you like to be modified?
628,BATTY,628,"Had in mind something a little more
radical."
629,TYRELL,629,What's the problem?
630,BATTY,630,Death.
631,TYRELL,631,"I'm afraid that's a little out of
my..."
632,BATTY,632,"I want more life, fucker."
633,TYRELL,633,Come here.
634,TYRELL,634,Sit down.
635,TYRELL,635,"The facts of life.  I'll be blunt.
To make an alteration in the
evolvement of an organic life
system, at least by men, makers
or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence
can't be revised once it's
established."
636,BATTY,636,Why?
637,TYRELL,637,"Because by the second day of
incubation any cells that have
undergone reversion mutation give
rise to revertant colonies -- like
rats leaving a sinking ship.  The
ship sinks."
638,BATTY,638,What about E.M.S. recombination?
639,TYRELL,639,"We've already tried it -- ethyl
methane sulfonate is an alkylating
agent and a potent mutagen -- it
creates a virus so lethal the
subject was destroyed before we
left the table."
640,BATTY,640,"Then a repressor protein that blocks
the operating cells."
641,TYRELL,641,"Wouldn't obstruct replication, but
it does give rise to an error in
replication, so that the newly
formed DNA strand carries a
mutation and you're got a virus
again... but all this is academic
-- you are made as good as we could
make you."
642,BATTY,642,But not to last.
643,TYRELL,643,"Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are
made to last -- as least they were.
But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari.
A high strung racing car -- built
to win, not to last."
644,TYRELL,644,"Also you're too valuable to
experiment with."
645,BATTY,645,I am?
646,TYRELL,646,"The bast of all possible androids.
We're proud of our prodigal son --
glad you're returned.  You're quite
a prize."
647,BATTY,647,I've done some questionable things.
648,TYRELL,648,Also extraordinary things.
649,BATTY,649,"Nothing the God of biomechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for."
650,BATTY,650,"Could you tell me where the
bathroom is?"
651,MRS. TYRELL,651,May I help you?
652,DECKARD (V.O.),652,"She'd never seen the great outdoors.
Never even seen books on the
subject.  She went through
everything I had, and we talked.
And there were subjects we didn't
discuss and they were words we
didn't say, I couldn't say, like
death, like future, like real.  But
it was hard because she was curious
and full of questions.  She was
more alive than anyone I'd ever
known."
653,RACHAEL,653,"You and I are good friends, huh?"
654,RACHAEL,654,It's so easy.
655,RACHAEL,655,"Have you ever known anybody a long
time?"
656,DECKARD,656,You mean a woman?
657,RACHAEL,657,Uh-huh.
658,DECKARD,658,What's a long time?
659,RACHAEL,659,Ten years.
660,DECKARD,660,"Nope.  Nobody could stand me that
long."
661,DECKARD,661,Yeah.
662,BRYANT,662,This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
663,DECKARD,663,Yeah.
664,BRYANT,664,She's not with you?
665,DECKARD,665,Who.
666,BRYANT,666,"Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth
floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia
South."
667,DECKARD,667,Got it.
668,BRYANT,668,"Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his
family and half his staff were just
massacred.  The cat is about to get
out of the bag.  Pressure is
definitely on.  The Nexus program
is terminated.  When you finish
there, locate Nexus designated Rachael
and retire."
669,BRYANT,669,"If you don't, we will.  It has to
be total, Deckard.  That's an order
from as high as it comes.  Got it?"
670,DECKARD,670,Yeah.  I got it.
671,BRYANT,671,Go.
672,RACHAEL,672,"Why do you call it retire, why
don't you call it murder?"
673,DECKARD,673,Because it's not.
674,RACHAEL,674,"Don't you think anything that can
suffer deserves to be considered?"
675,DECKARD,675,"Andies only simulate suffering --
if they're programmed for it."
676,RACHAEL,676,"Do you think I simulated what
happened between us?"
677,DECKARD,677,"No, I don't."
678,DECKARD,678,"Don't leave here.  Don't open the
door, don't answer the phone."
679,RACHAEL,679,What difference will it make?
680,DECKARD,680,Just wait here.
681,RACHAEL,681,You know what I think?
682,DECKARD,682,What?
683,RACHAEL,683,"That some of the folks around here
are more programmed then me."
684,RACHAEL,684,You know what else I think?
685,DECAKRD,685,What?
686,RACHAEL,686,This was the best day of my life.
687,MARY,687,"Let's go while there is still
time."
688,BATTY,688,Where?
689,MARY,689,Anywhere.
690,BATTY,690,What's the point?
691,MARY,691,Not to be trapped.
692,BATTY,692,"You underestimate the trap, Mary."
693,BATTY,693,"Where are you going, Sebastian?"
694,SEBASTIAN,694,Just thought I'd...
695,BATTY,695,"No, you stay here with us.  Out
last night together."
696,BATTY,696,"Think of yourself as a light, Mary.
Shine before you're turned off."
697,SEBASTIAN,697,Someone is coming here.
698,BATTY,698,One man.
699,BATTY,699,He must be good.
700,MARY,700,Then go get him.
701,BATTY,701,That wouldn't be very sporting.
702,PRIS,702,I want to do it.
703,BATTY,703,"Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a
little for everybody.  A
masterpiece."
704,BATTY,704,"Turn out the lights, Pris."
705,PRIS,705,"Naughty, naughty."
706,DECKARD,706,"Hello, Roy."
707,BATTY,707,You wanna play?
708,BATTY,708,"Not very sporting to fire on an
unarmed opponent.  I thought you
were supposed to be good.  Aren't
you the man?!"
709,BATTY,709,"This is how we do it up there, lad!
Come on!"
710,BATTY,710,"Not hurt, are you?  You better get
it up or I'm going to have to kill
you.  Unless you're alive you can't
play.  And if you don't play, you
don't get to be alive."
711,BATTY,711,That's the spirit.
712,BATTY'S VOICE,712,"Come on, Deckard, show me what you
got!  I'm right here on the other
side of the door.  But you gotta
shoot straight 'cause I'm fast!"
713,BATTY,713,"Straight doesn't seem to be good
enough."
714,BATTY,714,"You don't have a chance, do you?"
715,BATTY,715,"Looks like I'm gonna have to scale
it down for you.  Give you a
handicap.  I won't run through any
more walls.  Okay?  I promise to
use the doors.  Okay?"
716,BATTY,716,"Come on, let's use that brain!"
717,BATTY,717,"Think!  We need a little
resilience around here!"
718,BATTY,718,"Where are those balls of yours?!
Let's see a little bravery!"
719,BATTY,719,"That was irrational of me -- not
to mention unsportsmanlike.  Won't
happen again."
720,BATTY,720,"I'll be down the hall when you're
ready."
721,BATTY,721,Where you going?
722,BATTY,722,"No cheating.  A promise is a
promise.  I'll honor the
handicapped, but we gotta play on
the top floor.  You go get your
laser gun now.  And I'll give you
a few seconds before I come."
723,BATTY'S VOICE,723,One!
724,BATTY'S VOICE,724,Two!
725,BATTY'S VOICE,725,"No fair jumping through holes.  You
might get hurt doing that!  THREE!"
726,BATTY,726,Five!
727,BATTY,727,Six!
728,BATTY'S VOICE,728,Seven!
729,BATTY,729,"Oh, I wonder where he is.  Not in
here, I don't think.  Eight!"
730,BATTY,730,"Maybe here.  Doesn't sound like
it.  Nine!"
731,BATTY,731,Ten!
732,BATTY,732,One point for you.
733,BATTY,733,Ho ho!  Try it again!
734,BATTY,734,"What's wrong?  Don't you like me?
I'm what we've made!"
735,BATTY,735,"What's wrong?  Aren't you a lover
of Faster, Bigger and Better?!"
736,BATTY,736,It's time to die.
737,BATTY,737,Ah!
738,BATTY,738,That's for you.
739,BATTY,739,"Stick it in your ear and push.
If that doesn't work, try the
eye."
740,BATTY,740,"Believe me, it'll be better
for you than what I'm about
to do."
741,BATTY,741,Well?
742,BATTY,742,Crap.
743,DECKARD (V.O.),743,"She wanted to go to a place I knew.
Out of the city.  Like one of those
pictures she saw.  Where there were
trees but no buildings."
744,DECKARD (V.O.),744,"We had a good time.  She told me a
funny story and I taught her a
song.  A song about monkeys and
elephants.  And it made us laugh so
hard we couldn't sing."
745,DECKARD (V.O.),745,"I told myself over and over again,
if I hadn't done it, they would
have.
I didn't go back to the city, not
that city, I didn't want the job.
She said the great advantage of
being alive was to have a choice.
And she chose.  And a part of me
was almost glad.  Not because she
was gone but because this way they
could never touch her.
As for Tyrell -- he was murdered,
but he wasn't dead.  For a long
time I wanted to kill him.  But
what was the point?  There were too
many Tyrells.  But only one Rachael.
Maybe real and unreal could never
be separated.  The secret never
found.  But I got as close with
her as I'd ever come to it.  She'd
stay with me a long time.  I guess
we made each other real."
