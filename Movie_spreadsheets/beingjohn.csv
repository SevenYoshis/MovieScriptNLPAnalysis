0,LOTTE,0,"Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin
Hatch was out of his pen. Good
morning."
1,CRAIG,1,Morning.
2,LOTTE,2,"Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms
coming in first thing."
3,CRAIG,3,Enjoy.
4,LOTTE,4,"Craig, listen, honey, I've been
thinking... maybe you'd feel better
if you got, you know, a job or
something."
5,CRAIG,5,"We've been over this. Nobody's
looking for a puppeteer in today's
wintry economic climate."
6,LOTTE,6,"Well, you know, maybe something else
until this whole puppet thing turns
around."
7,CRAIG,7,"The Great Mantini doesn't need a day
job."
8,LOTTE,8,"Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini."
9,LOTTE,9,"Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me
a favor?"
10,CRAIG,10,What?
11,LOTTE,11,"Would you check in on Elijah? He seems
to be a little under the weather this
morning."
12,CRAIG,12,Which one is Elijah again?
13,LOTTE,13,The monkey.
14,CRAIG,14,Yeah. Okay.
15,TV ANNOUNCER,15,"The crowd is enthralled as Derek
Mantini, arguably the greatest
puppeteer in the history of the
world, performs ""The Belle of
Amherst"" with his 60 foot Emily
Dickinson puppet, directed by the
inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly."
16,CHARLES NELSON REILLY,16,"Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong."
17,CRAIG,17,Gimmicky bastard.
18,LOTTE,18,Is the trial date set?
19,CRAIG,19,May 11th.
20,LOTTE,20,"Why'd you do it, Craig?"
21,CRAIG,21,I'm a puppeteer.
22,LOTTE,22,"Why, Craig. why?"
23,CRAIG,23,I... puppeteer.
24,LOTTE,24,"You know, maybe you should speak to
someone about this."
25,WOMAN #1,25,"Seven and a half, right?"
26,CRAIG,26,Uh. yeah.
27,WOMAN #1,27,I'll take you through it.
28,WOMAN #1,28,Seven and a half.
29,CRAIG,29,Thank you.
30,FLORIS,30,"Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet
your filing needs?"
31,CRAIG,31,"No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz.
I have an interview with Mr. Lester."
32,FLORIS,32,"Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez..."
33,CRAIG,33,Schwartz.
34,FLORIS,34,Pardon?
35,CRAIG,35,Schwartz.
36,FLORIS,36,"I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're saying right now."
37,CRAIG,37,My name is Schwartz.
38,FLORIS,38,"Money, Miss Warts?"
39,CRAIG,39,Forget it.
40,FLORIS,40,Fork ah did?
41,FLORIS,41,Mr. Juarez?
42,CRAIG,42,Yes?
43,FLORIS,43,Yex?
44,CRAIG,44,"I said ""yes."""
45,FLORIS,45,"You suggest what? I have no time for
piddling suggestions from mumbling job
applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr.
Lester will see you now. I think
that's what he said."
46,LESTER,46,"Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but,
well, you know."
47,CRAIG,47,"Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz,
Dr. Lester."
48,LESTER,48,Security.
49,CRAIG,49,"No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with
your secretary."
50,LESTER,50,"She's not my secretary. She's what
they call an executive liaison, and
I'm not banging her, if that's what
youre implying."
51,CRAIG,51,"Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply
misspoke."
52,LESTER,52,"Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you
feel you can bring to LesterCorp?"
53,CRAIG,53,"Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer."
54,LESTER,54,"You think so, eh? Which comes first,
L or... Glooph?"
55,CRAIG,55,"Glooph is not a letter, sir."
56,LESTER,56,"Damn, you are good. I tried to trick
you. Okay, put these in order."
57,LESTER (CONT'D),57,"Floris, get Guinness on the phone."
58,FLORIS (O.S.),58,Gehginnis ondah foam?
59,LESTER,59,Forget it.
60,FLORIS (CONT'D),60,Fork ah did?
61,LESTER,61,"Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how
she puts up with this damn speech
impediment of mine."
62,CRAIG,62,"You don't have a speech impediment,
Dr. Lester."
63,LESTER,63,"Flattery will get you everywhere,
my boy. But I'm afraid I have to
trust Floris on this one. You see,
she has her doctorate in speech
impedimentology from Case Western.
Perhaps you've read her memoirs,
""I can't understand a word any of
you are saying."""
64,CRAIG,64,No.
65,LESTER,65,"Pity, it tells it like it is.
That's why the eastern, read Jewish,
publishing establishment won't touch
it. That's a quote from the book
jacket. George Will, I think."
66,LESTER,66,"I apologize if you can't understan
a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz."
67,CRAIG,67,No. I understand perfectly.
68,LESTER,68,"Thank you for being kind enough to
lie. You see, I've been very lonely
in my isolated tower of
indecipherable speech. You're hired.
Any questions?"
69,CRAIG,69,Just one. Why is this floor so short?
70,LESTER,70,"Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the
savings on to you."
71,LESTER,71,"But seriously, that's all covered in
orientation."
72,NARRATOR (0.S.),72,"Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor of the
Mertin-Flemmer building. As you
will now be spending your work day
here, it is important that you learn
a bit about the history of this
famous floor."
73,WENDY,73,"Hello, Don."
74,DON,74,Hello. Wendy.
75,WENDY,75,"Don, I was wondering, do you know
why our workplace has such low
ceilings?"
76,DON,76,"It's an interesting story, Wendy.
Many years ago in the late 1800's,
James Mertin, an Irish ship captain
looking to invest in the future of
our great country, came to this town
and decided to erect an office
building."
77,DON (CONT'D) (V.0.),77,"He would call this building the
Mertin-Flemmer Building, after
himself and someone else, who, local
legend has it, was named Flemmer."
78,DON (CONT'D) (V.0.),78,"One day. Captain Mertin received an
unexpected visitor."
79,MERTIN,79,"Enter ye, if ye dare enter."
80,TINY WOMAN,80,Captain Mertin?
81,MERTIN,81,"What want ye, girl child?"
82,TINY WOMAN,82,"I am not a child, Captain Mertin,
but rather an adult lady of miniature
proportions."
83,MERTIN,83,"I see. Well, it is not my fault that
thou art tiny. So if it is charity
yer after, then be gone with ye,
ye foul demon."
84,TINY WOMAN,84,"I am not asking for alms, but rather
the ear of a kind man with a noble
heart."
85,MERTIN,85,Aye. Speak then if ye must.
86,TINY WOMAN,86,"Captain Mertin, surely I am a
God-fearing Christian woman like
yourself, but alas, I am afraid that
the world was not built with me in
mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs
are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms
mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie
lady, Captain. after all, who would
marry a person of my diminutiveness?
So I am forced to work for my few
pennies a week as an optometrist.
Why cannot there be a place for me
to work safe and comfortable?"
87,MERTIN,87,"Woman, your story moves me like n
other. Me own sister was tiny and
then died. Therefore, I shall make
ye me wife. And I shall build a
floor in my building, between the
7th and 8th, which will be scaled
down, so from now on there shall
be at least one place on God's green
Earth that you and your accursed
kind can live in peace..."
88,DON,88,"So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since
the rents are considerably lower
this floor has been adopted by
businesses which for one reason
or another are forced to cut corners
After all... the overhead is low!
Ha ha ha!"
89,WENDY,89,Ha ha ha!
90,CRAIG,90,Moving story.
91,MAXINE,91,"Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit.
The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil
that it could never be revealed
to Americans raised on sitcoms and
happy news anchors."
92,CRAIG,92,Is that true?
93,MAXINE,93,"Well, truth is for suckers, isn't
it?."
94,CRAIG,94,"Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just
starting out at LesterCorp."
95,MAXINE,95,"How dreary - to be - Somebody /
How public - like a Frog /
To tell one's name - the livelong June /
To an admiring Bog!"
96,CRAIG,96,Emily Dickinson.
97,MAXINE,97,I wouldn't know.
98,PARROT,98,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
99,CRAIG,99,Shut up!
100,LOTTE,100,"Sorry, honey."
101,PARROT,101,Sorry honey. Sorry honey.
102,NEIGHBOR (0.S.),102,Shut up!
103,LOTTE,103,Sorry!
104,PARROT (0.S.),104,Help! She's locking me in a cage!
105,LOTTE,105,"Isn't that cute? I just taught her
that."
106,CRAIG,106,"Adorable. What time are they supposed
to be here?"
107,LOTTE,107,Seven-ish
108,CRAIG,108,We have to make it an early night.
109,LOTTE,109,"They'll understand. Besides I've got
a morning appointment tomorrow with
Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the
bottom of this acid stomach."
110,CRAIG,110,Hmmm.
111,LOTTE,111,"Some sort of childhood trauma, she
thinks. Possible feelings of
inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting,
huh?"
112,CRAIG,112,Hmmm.
113,PETER,113,"Good food, Lotte."
114,LOTTE,114,"Thanks. Craig helped, too, by the
way."
115,PETER,115,"Vegetarian, right?"
116,LOTTE,116,Yes. All vegetable. all the time.
117,PETER,117,Amazing.
118,PETER (CONT'D),118,"No kidding about that 7 1/2 floor.
Craig?"
119,CRAIG,119,"No kidding, Peter."
120,GLORIA,120,"That's great. It almost sounds like
make-believe."
121,GLORIA,121,Like a storybook.
122,GLORIA,122,like a fairy tale.
123,GLORIA,123,It's really great.
124,GLORIA,124,"So Lotte, when you say all vegetable,
do you mean all vegetable entire1y?"
125,GLORIA,125,"Lotte told me that Eskimos have a
lot of words for snow."
126,PETER,126,How many?
127,GLORIA,127,"Ten, I think."
128,PETER,128,I wonder why so many.
129,GLORIA,129,"Because they have a lot of snow.
Isn't that interesting?"
130,FLORIS,130,You're good.
131,CRAIG,131,"Thank you, Floris."
132,FLORIS,132,"You're not like the other boys
we've had here. Granted, I can't
understand what you're saying either,
but your soft palette resonates
tremendously well and you never
ever constrict your epiglottis."
133,CRAIG,133,I am a trained performer.
134,FLORIS,134,"Music to my ears! Whatever you said.
Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent
friend, speak!"
135,CRAIG,135,Hello again.
136,MAXINE,136,"Yes, well..."
137,CRAIG,137,"You know, I've been thinking about
what you said yesterday, about the
orientation film being a cover-up.
I think you're on to something."
138,MAXINE,138,"And fifty other lines to get into
a girl's pants."
139,CRAIG,139,"No, really."
140,MAXINE,140,"You know, if you ever got me, you
wouldn't have a clue what to do
with me. That's the thing, Romeo."
141,LOTTE,141,New puppet?
142,CRAIG,142,"Yeah, just an idea I had."
143,LOTTE,143,She's very beautiful.
144,CRAIG,144,Just an idea I had.
145,CRAIG (CONT'D),145,"C'mon, let's go to bed."
146,CRAIG,146,I would too know what to do with you.
147,FLORIS,147,"Oh, what magic those fingers could
work on the right cabinet."
148,FLORIS,148,"Alphabetize me, baby. And don't
forget, I comes before U."
149,CRAIG,149,"Floris, you're very nice, but I'm
afraid Im in love with somebody
else."
150,FLORIS,150,"I'm afraid I... have no idea what
you are saying... you bastard!"
151,LESTER,151,"Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz.
Why, if I were eighty years younger,
I'd box your ears."
152,CRAIG,152,"I wasn't toying with her, sir. I
was just... How old are you?"
153,LESTER,153,One hundred and five. Carrot juice.
154,LESTER,154,"Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost
not worth it. I piss orange. Oh,
and I, have to piss sitting down...
like a godamn girly... every fifteen
minutes. But nobody wants to die,
Schwartz."
155,CRAIG,155,"I'll keep that in mind, sir."
156,LESTER,156,"No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what
I do is get older, wrinkled like a
former plum that's become the
wrinkled prune you see before you.
Oh, to be a young man again, maybe
then Floris would care for me."
157,CRAIG,157,"The elderly have so much to offer,
sir. They are our link with history."
158,LESTER,158,"I don't want to be your godamn link,
damn you. I want to feel Floris'
naked thighs against my own. I want
to know passion. I want my body to
inspire lust in that beautiful,
complex woman. I want her to shiver
in a spasm of ecstasy when I
penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony
of the flesh, Schwartz."
159,CRAIG,159,"Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that
you share your feelings with me, I
believe perhaps the workplace is not
the most suitable environment for
this type of discussion."
160,LESTER,160,"All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice
Juice Bar after work today and I'll
spill my goddamn guts for you."
161,CRAIG,161,Shit.
162,CRAIG,162,"I won't be late. I just have to
listen to Lester's sexual fantasies
and drink carrot juice for a little
while. It's a job thing."
163,CRAIG (CONT'D),163,"I gotta go back to work. Yeah,
okay. You too. Okay. Bye."
164,MAXINE,164,What?
165,CRAIG,165,"I just wanted to say hi.  Did
you know I still don't know your
name or where you work?"
166,MAXINE,166,Yeah.
167,CRAIG,167,"How about this, if I can guess your
first name within three tries, you
have to come out for a drink with me
tonight."
168,MAXINE,168,Why not?
169,CRAIG,169,Great.
170,CRAIG,170,"Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . .
Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. .
nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . .
tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . .
nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee
Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . .
sssseeeeeen. Maxine?"
171,MAXINE,171,Who told you?
172,CRAIG,172,I'm right?
173,MAXINE,173,Who told you?
174,CRAIG,174,"That's incredible! Nobody told me!
I swear! It's kismet. Maxine!
It's a beautiful name. There's a
psychic connection. Don't you see?
It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine!
Maxine! I will shout it from the
rooftops!"
175,MAXINE,175,Somebody told you.
176,CRAIG,176,"Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine,
Maxine. It just came out of me like
a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy,
song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!"
177,MAXINE,177,"I am dubious, but I don't welsh.
Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven
o'clock. You're late, I walk. So
help me, if I find out you cheated."
178,CRAIG,178,Maxine.
179,LESTER,179,"Imagine a room full of women.
Nubile, blonde, wet with desire,
Schwartz. A harem, if you will.
Me in leather. A harness, if you
like. I am the object of this
desire, and all eyes are on me as
I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am
the love god, Eros. I intoxicate
you. My spunk is to you manna from
heaven..."
180,CRAIG,180,"Dr. Lester, it's been really
fascinating, but I'm afraid I have
to get home to my wife now."
181,LESTER,181,"Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her,
Craig."
182,CRAIG,182,Yessir.
183,LESTER,183,"Shall we say dinner on Friday.
Just the two of us?"
184,LESTER,184,"You can come too if you like,
Schwartz."
185,CRAIG,185,"That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta
run."
186,CRAIG,186,"Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine,
Maxine."
187,MAXINE,187,Just.
188,CRAIG,188,"Buy you a drink, Maxine?"
189,MAXINE,189,You married?
190,CRAIG,190,Yeah. But enough about me.
191,CRAIG (CONT'D),191,What'll you have?
192,MAXINE,192,"The usual, Barry."
193,CRAIG,193,"I'll have, like, a beer. Like a
Budweiser, or something."
194,CRAIG (CONT'D),194,"I like you. I don't know what it
is exactly."
195,MAXINE,195,My tits?
196,CRAIG,196,"No, no, it's your energy or your
attitude or the way you carry
yourself or..."
197,MAXINE,197,"Christ, you're not a fag are you?
Because I don't want to be wasting
my time."
198,CRAIG,198,That's the usual?
199,MAXINE,199,"Dont let the girly shit fool you.
It'd blow your shorts off."
200,MAXINE (CONT'D),200,"Set me up again, Barry."
201,CRAIG,201,"Im not a homosexual. I just like
women for more than their bodies.
I guess you could say I'm the new
American male."
202,MAXINE,202,You're a fag or a liar.
203,CRAIG,203,"I mean, I am really attracted to
you."
204,MAXINE,204,"I mean, I am really attracted to
you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can
share recipes, if you like, Darlene."
205,CRAIG,205,"No, wait! I like your tits."
206,CRAIG,206,"I love your tits. I want to fuck
you."
207,MAXINE,207,Good. Now we're getting somewhere.
208,MAXINE,208,Not a chance.
209,MAXINE (CONTD),209,"So, tell me about yourself. If you
can get your mind out of the gutter
long enough, dog-boy."
210,CRAIG,210,"Well, I'm a puppeteer..."
211,MAXINE,211,Check.
212,CRAIG,212,Hi.
213,LOTTE,213,Hi.
214,CRAIG,214,"Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just
wouldn't let me go. Were supposed
to have dinner with him on Friday.
I can get us out of it if you want.
He's really amazing, this insane old
lech. It's actually sort of amusing
when you get past just how disgusting
it is."
215,LOTTE,215,Did you eat?
216,CRAIG,216,"Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I
didn't call. It was just, you know,
hard to get away."
217,LOTTE,217,I was worried.
218,CRAIG,218,I'm sorry. How was your evening?
219,LOTTE,219,"Tom-Tom's puncture wound is
infected."
220,CRAIG,220,The ferret?
221,LOTTE,221,The iguana.
222,CRAIG,222,Right.
223,LOTTE,223,"I dressed the wound. Then I've
just been feeding everyone, putting
everyone to bed."
224,CRAIG,224,Yeah. You want a beer?
225,LOTTE,225,No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
226,CRAIG,226,"All right. I'll be in my workshop
for a little while. I'll be in in
a little while. I need to unwind a
little."
227,CRAIG,227,I'll be in soon. A little while.
228,LOTTE,228,'kay.
229,CRAIG,229,"Tell me, Craig, why do you love
puppeteering?"
230,CRAIG,230,"Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.
Perhaps it's the idea of becoming
someone else for a little while.
Being inside another skin. Moving
differently, thinking differently,
feeling differently."
231,CRAIG,231,"Interesting. Would you like to be
inside my skin, Craig? Think what I
think? Feel what I feel?"
232,CRAIG,232,More than anything. Maxine.
233,CRAIG,233,"It's good in here, Craig. Better
than your wildest dreams."
234,CRAIG,234,Hi.
235,MAXINE,235,"You're not someone I could get
interested in. Craig. You play
with dolls."
236,CRAIG,236,"Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea
of being inside someone else,
feeling what they feel, seeing
what they see..."
237,MAXINE,237,Yikes.
238,CRAIG,238,"Please, let me explain."
239,CRAIG,239,"It's just, and I've never done
this before, Maxine, but it's just
that I feel something for you. I've
never felt this before for anyone,
not even my wife. My future is with
you, Maxine."
240,MAXINE,240,"You might want to check those tarot
cards one more time."
241,CRAIG,241,"Another evil secret of the 7 1/2
floor."
242,CRAIG,242,"Holy shit. Maxine is gonna love
this."
243,LESTER,243,Yes?
244,CRAIG,244,Dr. Lester. . .
245,LESTER,245,"Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted
to see."
246,LESTER,246,"Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your
fingers clear of the blade, and
never, never use it while bathing in
a tub full of water."
247,CRAIG,247,"Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was
in that vacant office down the hall
and I stumbled upon a little door
and...."
248,LESTER,248,"Ah. yes, the little door."
249,LESTER,249,"There is a short film on the little
door in the orientation room in
exactly two minutes. If you hurry,
you'll just make it."
250,CRAIG,250,"Thank you, sir."
251,LESTER,251,Put up reel 752.
252,DON,252,"Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in
this vacant office."
253,WENDY,253,"Well, Don, I peeked in here, even
though I know it's against floor
policy. and I discovered that
there's a little tiny door in here.
Isn't it cute? It's almost like a
little dolly's door. I wonder what
its for."
254,DON,254,"That's right, Wendy, it is against
floor policy, but as long as you're
here, let me tell you what I know
about our cute little door friend.
Many years ago, this very office
was occupied by a kindly old
watchmaker named Mr. White."
255,WHITE,255,"Hmmm. I must have a small store
room to store my merchandise when
I am through working on it. I know,
I will build a tiny store room.
How cute!"
256,WENDY,256,"Wow! That's some story, Don."
257,DON,257,"Truth is stranger than fiction,
Wendy!"
258,CRAIG,258,Bullshit.
259,CRAIG (CONT'D) (V.0.),259,Whoa! What the hell? Where am I?
260,CRAIG (CONT'D) (V.0.),260,"Holy shit! It's that actor guy.
Shit! What's his name? That actor
guy! What's happening? Am I
inside him? Am I in his brain?
Am I him? Is he me? Does he know
I'm here? My brain is reeling!
Is his brain reeling?"
261,MAXINE,261,"The puppeteer told me he loves me
today."
262,MAXINE,262,"I know. I can't think of anything
more pathetic."
263,MALKOVICH (V.0.),263,"The Broadhurst Theater, please."
264,CABBIE,264,"Say, aren't you that actor guy?"
265,MALKOVICH,265,Yeah.
266,CABBIE,266,John Makel...
267,CRAIG (V.0.),267,John Malkovich! Of course!
268,CABBIE,268,Mapplethorpe?
269,MALKOVICH (V.0.),269,Malkovich.
270,CABBIE,270,Malkovich!
271,CRAIG (V.0.),271,John fucking Malkovich!
272,CABBIE,272,Yeah. I liked you in that one movie.
273,MALKOVICH (V.0.),273,Thank you.
274,CABBIE,274,"The one where you're that jewel
thief."
275,MALKOVICH,275,I never played a jewel thief.
276,CABBIE,276,Who am I thinking of?
277,MALKOVICH,277,I don't know.
278,CABBIE,278,"I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey,
could I get your autograph now?
It's for .... oh, what the hell,
it's for me! I'm your biggest
fan!"
279,MALKOVICH,279,"Yeah, okay."
280,CRAIG (V.0.),280,Ahhhh!
281,MAXINE,281,"Absolutely, doll. I'm just about
to close up here."
282,MAXINE (CONTD),282,"Meet you at The Pig in twenty
minutes."
283,MAXINE (CONTD),283,"Oh yeah, maybe I'll keep my legs
closed till then."
284,MAXINE (CONTD),284,"I'm splitting for the day. Lock up
for me, won't you, darling."
285,CRAIG,285,"Don't you want to know what happened
to me?"
286,MAXINE,286,No.
287,CRAIG,287,This is important!
288,MAXINE,288,It better be.
289,CRAIG,289,"There's a tiny door in that empty
office. It's a portal, Maxine. It
takes you inside John Malkovich.
You see the world through John
Malkovich's eyes, then, after about
fifteen minutes, you're spit out into
a ditch on the side of The New Jersey
Turnpike."
290,MAXINE,290,"Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is
John Malkovich?"
291,CRAIG,291,"He's an actor. One of the great
American actors of the 20th century."
292,MAXINE,292,What's he been in?
293,CRAIG,293,"Lots of things. He's very well
respected. That jewel thief movie,
for example. The point is that this
is a very odd thing, supernatural,
for lack of a better word. It raises
all sorts of philosophical questions
about the nature of self, about the
existence of the soul. Am I me? Is
Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha
right, is duality an illusion? Do
you see what a can of worms this
portal is? I don't think I can go
on living my life as I have lived
it. There's only one thing to do.
Let's get married right away."
294,MAXINE,294,Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
295,CRAIG,295,"Yes, of course. He's a celebrity."
296,MAXINE,296,Good. We'll sell tickets.
297,CRAIG,297,Tickets to Malkovich?
298,MAXINE,298,Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
299,CRAIG,299,"But there's something profound here,
Maxine, we can't exploit it."
300,MAXINE,300,"Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going
to offer a partnership to you, but
this way it's more money for me."
301,CRAIG,301,You wanted to be partners with me?
302,MAXINE,302,Sure. It'd be fun.
303,CRAIG,303,Really?
304,CRAIG,304,"But, Maxine, can of worms! End of
the world! Illusory nature of
existence!"
305,MAXINE,305,"I'll protect you, Dollface."
306,CRAIG,306,Oh. Maxine.
307,LOTTE,307,"Don't be ridiculous. There is no such
thing as a portal into someone else's
brain."
308,CRAIG,308,"Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte.
I was right inside him looking out.
We're going to be rich."
309,LOTTE,309,I want to try.
310,CRAIG,310,What?
311,LOTTE,311,"I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow
morning. Plus I'd like to meet this
partner of yours."
312,CRAIG,312,"Well, you know we're going to be
very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you
what. Let's do it tonight. Right
now."
313,LOTTE,313,Now?
314,CRAIG,314,"Yeah. We'll do it right now. On
the way to Lester's house."
315,CRAIG,315,I'll meet you on the turnpike.
316,LOTTE,316,I'm scared.
317,CRAIG,317,"Me too, babe."
318,LOTTE (V.0.),318,Holy cow!
319,LOTTE (V.0.),319,"Oh, yes. Yes."
320,LOTTE,320,I have to go back.
321,CRAIG,321,Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
322,LOTTE,322,I have to go back now.
323,CRAIG,323,We'll talk about it in the car.
324,LOTTE,324,"I have to go back, Craig. Being
inside did something to me. All of a
sudden everything made sense. I knew
who I was."
325,CRAIG,325,"You weren't you. You were John
Malkovich."
326,LOTTE,326,"I was, wasn't I?"
327,LOTTE,327,I was John fucking Malkovich!
328,LOTTE,328,"Take me back, Craig."
329,CRAIG,329,Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
330,LESTER,330,"Tell me, Lotte, can you understand
a word I'm saying?"
331,LOTTE,331,"Yes, of course, Dr. Lester."
332,LESTER,332,"Oh, be still my heart."
333,LOTTE,333,"Dr. Lester, would you point me
toward the restroom?"
334,LESTER,334,"With immense pleasure, my dear. Down
that hall, ninth door on the left.
Watch the step down. It's sunken,
you know."
335,CRAIG,335,Dr. Lester...
336,LESTER,336,"More beet-spinach juice, my friend?"
337,CRAIG,337,"No thank you sir. It's delicious,
though. I just wanted to thank you
for the opportunity to work at
LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm
going to have to tender my resignation
effectively immediately."
338,LESTER,338,"I see. Are you unhappy at our little
company?"
339,CRAIG,339,"No sir, not at all. It's just that
I'm going to open my own business
and..."
340,LESTER,340,"And what sort of business will this
be? If you don't mind my asking."
341,CRAIG,341,"Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right
on 7 1/2 actually."
342,CRAIG,342,"In the vacant office. So we'll still
be seeing each other."
343,LESTER,343,"The vacant office. I see. Olive oil.
Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz,
there are certain doors which
should never be opened."
344,CRAIG,344,"My kingdom for your portal, Maxine."
345,MAXINE,345,Okay. Here it is.
346,MAXINE,346,"Ever want to be someone else? Now you
can. No kidding. Only two hundred
dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit
J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building.
etc., etc."
347,CRAIG,347,"Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing.
Phone it in."
348,CRAIG,348,"Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet
shop?"
349,LOTTE,349,"Fuck pets. Is this your partner?
I had to come back and do the
Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything
else. Is this her?"
350,MAXINE,350,"Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad."
351,MAXINE,351,"Hi, are you Craig's wife?"
352,LOTTE,352,"Yes, Hi."
353,CRAIG,353,"Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte."
354,LOTTE,354,Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
355,MAXINE,355,"Hi, uh."
356,MAXINE,356,"Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes.
""Ever want to be someone else?""
No, that's the ad, but let's talk
about you in a minute. ""Ever want
to be someone else? Now you can.
No kidding..."""
357,CRAIG,357,Why aren't you at work?
358,LOTTE,358,"I've been going over and over my
experience last night. It was amazing."
359,LOTTE,359,"I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't
that the craziest thing?"
360,CRAIG,360,"What, are you nuts? That's Oprah
talking."
361,LOTTE,361,"Everything felt right for the first
time. I need to go back to make sure,
then if the feeling is still there.
I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman
about sexual reassignment surgery."
362,CRAIG,362,"This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an
allergist. If you're going to do
something, do it right."
363,CRAIG (cont'd),363,"It's just the thrill of seeing through
someone else's eyes, sweetie. It'll
pass."
364,LOTTE,364,"Don't stand in the way of my
actualization as a man, Craig."
365,MAXINE,365,"Let her go, Craig. I mean him."""
366,CRAIG,366,"Yeah, okay."
367,CRAIG,367,I'll pick you up.
368,MAXINE,368,You better hurry. Traffic.
369,MAXINE (CONT'D),369,"Davey? Max. Get me John Malkovich's
home phone? That's great. Love ya
and owe ya."
370,MALKOVICH,370,"So you believe in God... you got
something for it? You worked for
all the capitalists. You harvested
the fruit from your labor? You got
God!"
371,LOTTE (V.0.),371,"What raw, animal power!"
372,MALKOVICH,372,"But the past comforts you? The
present smiles on you, yes?"
373,MALKOVICH (CONT'D),373,Yeah?
374,MAXINE (0.S.),374,Mr. Malkovich?
375,MALKOVICH,375,Who's calling?
376,MAXINE (0.S.),376,"You don't know me, but I'm a great
admirer of yours."
377,MALKOVICH,377,How'd you get this number?
378,MAXINE (0.S.),378,"It's just that I fantasize about
you and, well, speaking to you
now has gotten me sort of excited
and..."
379,LOTTE (0.S.),379,"Oh, I like this."
380,MALKOVICH,380,"Listen, this is not amusing. Please
don't call here any..."
381,MAXINE (0.S.) (giggling),381,"Ooh, such authority! NY nipples are
at attention, General Malkovich, sir.
So I'll be at Bernardo's tonight at
eight. Please, please meet me there.
I just adored you in that jewel thief
movie..."
382,LOTTE (V.O.),382,My God!
383,LOTTE (V.O.),383,"Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet
her there. Meet her there. Meet her
there..."
384,LOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D),384,"Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet
her there..."
385,CRAIG,385,How was it?
386,LOTTE,386,"I have to go back tonight. At eight
Exactly."
387,CRAIG,387,Why?
388,LOTTE,388,"Don't crowd me, Craig."
389,GUY,389,"Excuse me, are you John Malkovich?"
390,MALKOVICH,390,Yes.
391,GUY,391,"Wow. You were really great in that
movie where you played that retard."
392,MALKOVICH,392,Thank you very much.
393,GUY,393,"I just wanted to tell you that. And
say thank you. I have a cousin that's
a retard, so, as you can imagine, it
means a lot to me to see retards
portrayed on the silver screen so
compassionately."
394,LOTTE (V.O.),394,Maxine!
395,MAXINE,395,"Hi. I'm so glad you decided to
come. I'm Maxine."
396,MALKOVICH,396,"I'm John. I didn't think I was going
to come, but I felt oddly compelled.
I have to admit I was a bit intrigued
by your voice."
397,LOTTE (V.O.),397,"God, she's beautiful. The way she's
looking at me. At him. At us."
398,MAXINE,398,"And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich,
my voice is probably the least
intriguing thing about me."
399,LOTTE (V.O.),399,"I've never been looked at like this
by a woman."
400,MALKOVICH,400,Can I get you a drink?
401,MAXINE,401,Whatever you're having.
402,CRAIG,402,So how was it? What was he doing?
403,LOTTE,403,"Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging
around his apartment. I think he must
be a lonely man."
404,CRAIG,404,"You see, men can feel unfulfilled,
too. I'm glad you're realizing that.
You shouldn't be so quick to assume
that switching bodies would be the
answer to all your problems."
405,LOTTE,405,"You're right. You know I was thinking
that we should have Maxine over for
dinner. Since you two are partners
and all. It might be a nice gesture."
406,CRAIG,406,"I don't know. There's some tension
between us. I'd hate to expose you to
that."
407,LOTTE,407,"It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna.
Well smoke a joint."
408,LOTTE,408,Tensions will melt away.
409,LOTTE,409,"Did you know that Eskimos have not
one, but fifty words for snow. It's
because they have so much of it."
410,CRAIG,410,After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
411,MAXINE,411,Ah.
412,LOTTE,412,"After that I'll introduce you to my
favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an
ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood
trauma. But we're getting to the
bottom of it."
413,LOTTE,413,Psychotherapy.
414,MAXINE,414,"The way I see it, the world is divide
into those go after what they want
and those who don't. The passionate
ones, the ones who go after what they
want, may not get what they want, but
they remain vital, in touch with
themselves, and when they lie on
their deathbeds, they have few
regrets. The ones who don't go
after what they want... well, who
gives a shit about them anyway?"
415,CRAIG,415,You?
416,MAXINE,416,"Craig, I just don't find you
attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten
with you, but only when you're in
Malkovich. When I looked into his
eyes last night, I could feel you
peering out. Behind the stubble and
the too-prominent brow and the male
pattern baldness, I sensed your
feminine longing peering out, and
it just slew me."
417,CRAIG,417,My God.
418,MAXINE,418,"Only to John, sweetie. I'm sorry."
419,MAXINE,419,Thanks for a wonderful dinner.
420,MAXINE,420,"No hard feelings, partner."
421,LOTTE,421,I want a divorce.
422,CRAIG,422,Come in!
423,ERROLL,423,"Hello, I'm here about the ad."
424,CRAIG,424,"Please, have a seat."
425,ERROLL,425,"When you say, I can be somebody
else, what do you mean exactly?"
426,CRAIG,426,"Exactly that. We can put you inside
someone else's body for fifteen minutes."
427,ERROLL,427,"Oh, this is just the medical
breakthrough I've been waiting for.
Are their any side effects? Please
say no! Please say no!"
428,MAXINE,428,No.
429,ERROLL,429,"Long term psychic or physiological
repercussions?"
430,MAXINE,430,No. Don't be an ass.
431,ERROLL,431,Can I be anyone I want?
432,MAXINE,432,You can be John Malkovich.
433,ERROLL,433,"Well that's perfect. My second
choice. Ah, this is wonderful.
Too good to be true! You see, I'm
a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh,
I've tried all the diets, my friends.
Lived for a year on nothing but
imitation mayonnaise. Did it work?
You be the judge. But Malkovich!
King of New York! Man about town!
Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant!
The Schopenhauer of the 20th century!
Thin man extraordinaire!"
434,MAXINE,434,"Two hundred dollars, please."
435,ERROLL,435,"Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!"
436,ERROLL,436,"Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thousand times, thank you!"
437,CRAIG,437,Tell your friends.
438,ERROLL,438,"Oh, I will, and I have many,
many friends and associates, my
friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters
Anonymous. All of them fat and alone
like me, all of them dream of being
someone else, all of them with John
Malkovich as their second choice!"
439,CRAIG,439,This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
440,MAXINE,440,"So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein."
441,LESTER,441,"You're making a big mistake, Schwartz."
442,LESTER,442,Ma'am
443,CRAIG,443,"Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're
talking about."
444,LESTER,444,"There are rules, boy, procedures,
etiquette. This is not a toy. I've
been waiting seventy years to utilize
this room, grooming myself, quietly
setting the stage, performing
ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all
his motion pictures again and again.
Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping
properly."
445,CRAIG,445,You're insane.
446,LESTER,446,"I am not alone. There are others. We
are legion. You will pay for this
blasphemy. You will pay dearly."
447,MAXINE,447,Crackpot.
448,DISCIPLES OF MALKOVICH,448,"How much do we love you? We loved
you in ""Making Mr. Right.""  That is
how much we love you. We even own the
director's cut on laser disc. Please
accept us into your head as we have
accepted you into our hearts. Please
let us be you. Amen."
449,LESTER,449,"May I have your attention, please.
We have a new disciple among us tonight."
450,DISCIPLES OF MALKOVICH,450,Hallelujah.
451,LESTER,451,She is the wife of Schwartz.
452,LOTTE,452,I'm getting divorced.
453,LESTER,453,"No you mustn't, my child."
454,LOTTE,454,"But why, Son of Malkovich?"
455,LESTER,455,"We need you on the inside, my child.
To report on his comings and goings,
and if need be, to... destroy him..."
456,LESTER,456,...for lack of a better word.
457,LOTTE,457,What are you doing?
458,CRAIG,458,"I'm moving. Remember? What's with
the hooded cloak?"
459,LOTTE,459,"Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been
thinking. Let's try to work this out.
We've got so much history."
460,CRAIG,460,"You should feed your animals. They're
looking peaked."
461,LOTTE,461,"I'm getting rid of the fucking
animals."
462,CRAIG,462,What?
463,LOTTE,463,"I'm getting rid of the animals. I've
lost interest. Besides, they're
standing between you and me."
464,CRAIG,464,No they're not.
465,LOTTE,465,You've always hated the animals.
466,CRAIG,466,You've always loved the animals.
467,LOTTE,467,"I'm giving them up. I've changed.
I've found a new focus."
468,CRAIG,468,What's that?
469,LOTTE,469,"Us, of course."
470,CRAIG,470,"Oh, Lot..."
471,CRAIG (CONT'D),471,What about Maxine?
472,LOTTE,472,Fuck Maxine.
473,CRAIG,473,We wish.
474,MAXINE,474,Yes?
475,LOTTE (O.S.),475,"I have to see you. Can you call him
and invite us over?"
476,MAXINE,476,When?
477,LOTTE (O.S.),477,"Give me one hour to get inside him
Exactly."
478,MAXINE,478,Thanks so much for coming over.
479,MALKOVICH,479,"Oh, I'm really glad you called."
480,MAXINE,480,"So, do you enjoy being an actor?"
481,MALKOVICH,481,Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
482,LOTTE (V.O.),482,Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
483,MAXINE,483,"I love you, Lotte."
484,LOTTE (V.O.),484,Maxine...
485,MALKOVICH,485,"I'm sorry, did you just call me
""Lotte""?"
486,MAXINE,486,Do you mind?
487,MALKOVICH,487,"No, I guess not. I'm an actor."
488,MAXINE,488,"Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte."
489,MALKOVICH,489,"Yes, Maxine, yes."
490,LOTTE (V.O.),490,This is too good to be true.
491,CRAIG,491,"You were him last night, weren't you?"
492,LOTTE,492,Yes.
493,CRAIG,493,And he was with her.
494,LOTTE,494,"We love her, Craig. I'm sorry."
495,CRAIG,495,We?
496,LOTTE,496,Me and John.
497,CRAIG,497,Don't forget me.
498,LOTTE,498,"Well, you have the Maxine action
figure to play with."
499,LOTTE (CONT'D),499,I'm sorry. That was nasty.
500,CRAIG,500,"Life is confusing, isn't it?"
501,LOTTE,501,"Sometimes we're forced to make
hard decisions."
502,LOTTE,502,"I'd like for us to stay together,
Craig. You know, platonically,
if that's possible. I truly value
our friendship."
503,CRAIG,503,"I feel that somehow my parents never
prepared me to make this particular
decision. Not that I blame them. How
could they know? Today's world is so
complicated."
504,CRAIG,504,"No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry,
Lotte. I'm so sorry."
505,MAXINE,505,You're late.
506,CRAIG,506,Are you torturing me on purpose?
507,MAXINE,507,I've fallen in love.
508,CRAIG,508,"I don't think so. I've fallen in
love. This is what people who've
fallen in love look like."
509,MAXINE,509,"You picked the unrequited variety.
Very bad for the skin."
510,CRAIG,510,"You're evil, Maxine."
511,MAXINE,511,"Do you have any idea what its like
to have two people look at you with
total lust and devotion through the
same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose
you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig."
512,LESTER,512,"Yes, my dear?"
513,FLORIS (O.S.),513,"Someone names A Lot of Warts on
line two."
514,LESTER,514,"Thank you, Floris."
515,FLORIS (O.S.),515,"Think, Jew florist?"
516,LESTER,516,"Good morning, Lotte!"
517,LOTTE (O.S.),517,"Dr. Lester, everything's falling
apart."
518,LOTTE,518,"I blew it, Dr. Lester."
519,LESTER,519,"You followed your heart, my child,
and that is not necessarily a bad
thing."
520,LOTTE,520,But now we've lost access to Craig.
521,LESTER,521,"My child, I don't think its a great
mystery what Craig's up to."
522,LOTTE,522,"I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed
to cherish me forever. Now you hold
a gun to my head?"
523,CRAIG,523,"Yeah, well welcome to the nineties."
524,LOTTE,524,Suck my dick!
525,CRAIG,525,Shut up!
526,CRAIG (CONT'D),526,Tell her you need to see her.
527,LOTTE,527,You bastard.
528,MAXINE (V.O.),528,"J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else
can be."
529,LOTTE,529,I have to see you.
530,MAXINE (V.O.),530,"Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's
business hours. I need to keep the
membranous tunnel open for paying
customers."
531,CRAIG,531,"Tell her, what the hell, close
early today, live dangerously."
532,LOTTE,532,"What the hell, darling. Close early
today, live dangerously."
533,MAXINE (V.O.),533,"Oooh, doll. I love this new
devil-may-care side of you. Alrighty,
I'll track down Lover-boy, and I'll
see both of you in one hour.
Exactamundo."
534,LOTTE,534,Help! He's locking me in a cage!
535,NEIGHBOR,535,Shut up!
536,PARROT,536,Shut up!
537,CRAIG,537,"Lesson number one:  Be careful what
you teach your parrot."
538,MALKOVICH,538,"Tommy, can I take fifteen?"
539,MAXINE,539,"Oh, Lotte... Oh, sweetie..."
540,MALKOVICH,540,Maxine...
541,CRAIG (V.O.),541,"I can't believe it. This is too
good to be true."
542,CRAIG,542,You're glowing again.
543,MAXINE,543,"A girl has a right to glow if
she wants. It's in the fucking
constitution."
544,CRAIG,544,"It was lovely being you being
Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen
the passionate side of sweet Maxine
before, or her actual tits for that
matter. If only, I've been thinking
to myself, if only I could actually
feel what Malkovich feels, rather
than just see what he sees... And
then, dare I say it, if only I could
control his arms, his legs, his
pelvis, and make them do my bidding."
545,LOTTE,545,"It'll never happen, fuckface."
546,CRAIG,546,"Ah, but you're forgetting one thing,
Lambchop."
547,LOTTE,547,What's that?
548,CRAIG,548,I'm a puppeteer.
549,MAXINE,549,"Lotte, this is so good..."
550,CRAIG (V.O.),550,"Move right hand across her left breast
now. Move right hand across her left
breast now. Move right hand across her
left breast now."
551,CRAIG (V.O.) (CONT'D),551,"Holy shit, yes!"
552,MALKOVICH,552,"Holy shit, yes!"
553,CRAIG (V.O.),553,Holy shit! He said what I said!
554,MALKOVICH,554,Holy shit! He said what I said!
555,MAXINE,555,Lotte? Is that you?
556,CRAIG (V.O.),556,"Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!"
557,MALKOVICH,557,"Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!"
558,MALKOVICH,558,"What the fuck is going on? I'm not
talking. This is not me!"
559,MAXINE,559,"Oh, Lotte..."
560,MALKOVICH,560,"Something was making me talk. Some
Goddamn thing was making me move. I
gotta get out of here."
561,MAXINE,561,"Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion
for me taking hold."
562,MALKOVICH,562,"No, Dollface, I know what my passion
taking hold feels like. I gotta go."
563,CRAIG,563,"I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm
across your girlfriend's glorious tit.
I made him talk. And, oh, there was
the beginning of sensation in the
fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a
matter of practice before Malkovich
becomes nothing more than another
puppet hanging next to my worktable.
Coffee?"
564,MALKOVICH,564,"It's like nothing I've ever felt
before. I think I'm going crazy."
565,KEVIN BACON,565,I'm sure you're not going crazy.
566,MALKOVICH,566,"Kevin, I'm telling you... it was
like nothing I've..."
567,KEVIN BACON,567,"Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda.
Were you stoned?"
568,MALKOVICH,568,"Yes, but you see, someone else was
talking through my mouth."
569,KEVIN BACON,569,"You were stoned. Case closed. End
of story. How hot is this babe?"
570,MALKOVICH,570,"I think it might've been this Lotte
woman talking through me. Maxine
likes to call me Lotte."
571,KEVIN BACON,571,"Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you
to channel some dead lesbian lover.
Let me know when you're done with her.
This is my type of chick."
572,MALKOVICH,572,"I'm done with her now. Tonight really
creeped me out."
573,KEVIN BACON,573,"You're crazy to let go of a chick who
calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a
friend."
574,MALKOVICH,574,"I don't know anything about her. What
if she's some sort of witch or
something?"
575,KEVIN BACON,575,"All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian
Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy.
Ha ha ha."
576,MALKOVICH,576,"I gotta know the truth, Kevin."
577,KEVIN BACON,577,"The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy."
578,MALKOVICH,578,"Excuse me, what type of service does
this company provide?"
579,FAT MAN,579,"You get to be John Malkovich for
fifteen minutes. Two hundred clams."
580,MALKOVICH,580,I see.
581,FAT MAN,581,"No cutting, by the way."
582,FAT MAN (CONT'D),582,No cutting!
583,CRAIG,583,"Hey! Break it up! Break it up!
Everybody gets a chance to be..."
584,FAT MAN,584,"It's him! Oh, we're so sorry Mr.
Malkovich! I hope me and my
associates from Overeaters Anonymous
didn't hurt you too terribly."
585,MALKOVICH,585,Inside.
586,MAXINE,586,Darling!
587,MALKOVICH,587,What the fuck is going on?
588,CRAIG,588,"Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig
Schwartz. I can explain. We operate
a little business her that...
simulates, for our clientele, the
experience of... being you, actually."
589,MALKOVICH,589,Simulates?
590,CRAIG,590,"Sure, after a fashion."
591,MALKOVICH,591,Let me try.
592,CRAIG,592,"You? Why I'm sure it would pale in
comparison to the actual experience."
593,MALKOVICH,593,Let me try!
594,MAXINE,594,Let him try.
595,CRAIG,595,"Of course, right this way, Mr.
Malkovich. Compliments of the house."
596,MALKOVICH,596,Jesus.
597,CRAIG,597,"What happens when a man climbs
through his own portal?"
598,MAXINE,598,"How the hell would I know? I wasn't
a philosophy major."
599,GIRL MALKOVICH,599,"Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
Malkovich..."
600,WAITER MALKOVICH,600,Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich?
601,GIRL MALKOVICH,601,"Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
Malkovich."
602,WAITER MALKOVICH,602,Malkovich Malkovich.
603,WAITER MALKOVICH,603,Malkovich?
604,MALKOVICH,604,Malkovich!
605,WAITER MALKOVICH,605,Malkovich.
606,SINGING MALKOVICH,606,"Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
Malkovich..."
607,CRAIG,607,So how was it?
608,MALKOVICH,608,That... was... no... simulation.
609,CRAIG,609,I know. I'm sorry...
610,MALKOVICH,610,"I have been to the dark side. I have
seen a world that no man should ever
see."
611,CRAIG,611,"Really? For most people it's a rather
pleasant experience. What exactly did
you..."
612,MALKOVICH,612,"This portal is mine and must be sealed
up forever. For the love of God."
613,CRAIG,613,"With all respect, sir, I discovered
that portal. Its my livelihood."
614,MALKOVICH,614,"It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see
you in court!"
615,CRAIG,615,"And who's to say I won't be seeing
what you're seeing... in court?"
616,MOTORIST,616,"Hey, Malkovich! Think fast!"
617,LOTTE,617,"Once this was a relationship based
on love. Now you have me in a cage
with a monkey and a gun to my head."
618,CRAIG,618,"Things change. Anyway, you gave up your
claim to that love the first time you
stuck your dick in Maxine."
619,LOTTE,619,You fell in love with her first.
620,CRAIG,620,"Yeah but I didn't do anything about
it. Out of respect for our marriage."
621,LOTTE,621,"You didn't do anything about it out
of respect for the fact that she
wouldn't let you near her with a ten
foot pole, which is, by the way,
about nine feet, nine inches off
the mark anyway."
622,CRAIG,622,"That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what
have I become? My wife in a cage
with a monkey. A gun in my hand.
Betrayal in my heart."
623,LOTTE,623,"Maybe this is what you've always
been, Craig, you just never faced
it before."
624,CRAIG,624,"Perhaps you're right. I can't let
you go though. Too much has happened.
You're my ace in the hole."
625,LOTTE,625,I need a shower.
626,CRAIG,626,"I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm
some kind of monster. I'm the guy
you read about in the paper and go,
""he's some kind of monster."""
627,LOTTE,627,"You're not a monster, Craig. Just
a confused man."
628,CRAIG,628,I love you so much.
629,CRAIG (CONT'D),629,"But I gotta go now. I've got to go
be Johnny."
630,MAXINE (O.S.),630,J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
631,LOTTE,631,We have to meet.
632,MAXINE,632,One hour.
633,CRAIG,633,"I'll tell you all about it when I
get home."
634,SAFARI MAN,634,"Well, there monkeys ain't going
nowhere. Let's get us a couple a
brews 'fore the boss comes back..."
635,CHIMP ONE (DUBBED VOICE),635,"Son, untie your mother and me!
Quickly! Before the great bald
chimp-men return."
636,CHIMP TWO (DUBBED VOICE),636,"Hurry, Elijah!"
637,SAFARI MAN,637,Why you little bastard!
638,LOTTE,638,"Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!"
639,LOTTE,639,"Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me
in John the last three times. Craig's
had me locked up in the apartment. He
made me call you at gunpoint. It's
been him! Oh, God, it's been him!"
640,MAXINE (O.S.),640,"Really? Well, you know, he's quite
good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have
a session with Malkovich I have to
attend. I'll speak with you soon."
641,LOTTE,641,"But Maxine, I thought it was me you
loved."
642,MAXINE (O.S.),642,"I thought so too, doll. I guess we
were mistaken."
643,LOTTE,643,"Hello, Dr. Lester?"
644,MALKOVICH,644,Come on in.
645,MAXINE,645,"I can explain about the portal,
darling."
646,MALKOVICH,646,"Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I
just let you up here to tell you
that, and to tell you that I'm taking
you and Schwartz to court."
647,MAXINE,647,Oh shut up.
648,MAXINE,648,"Craig, darling are you in there?"
649,MALKOVICH,649,Yes. How did you know it was me?
650,MAXINE,650,Lotte called me.
651,MALKOVICH,651,"Oh, so the bitch escaped."
652,MAXINE,652,"Apparently you can control this
Malkovich fellow now."
653,MALKOVICH,653,I'm getting better all the time.
654,MAXINE,654,"I'll say you are. Let's do it on his
kitchen table, then make him eat an
omelette off of it."
655,MALKOVICH,655,No... damn... you...
656,MALKOVICH,656,"Oh shut up, you overrated sack of
shit."
657,LESTER,657,"You know I think it pays to leave
juice-making to the trained
professionals. You look terrible,
my dear."
658,LOTTE,658,"Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr.
Lester."
659,LESTER,659,"Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must
inform you that I find that highly
arousing."
660,LOTTE,660,"No, you don't understand. I've been
inside Malkovich when I'm with
Maxine..."
661,LESTER,661,"What?! That is not allowed. My God,
you are supposed to be one of us.
You know you must never partake of
Malkovich by yourself!"
662,LOTTE,662,"No, I didn't know that."
663,LESTER,663,"Oh, didn't anyone show you the
indoctrination video?"
664,LOTTE,664,No.
665,LESTER,665,"Oh, sorry. Right this way."
666,LESTER ON FILM,666,"Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians.
As you may already know, today a
baby was born into this sad world."
667,LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D),667,"His name is John Horatio Hannibal
Malkovich. And we are the keepers
of the door to his soul. One day,
when his brain is big enough, we
will all journey into his head and
live there for all eternity. Following
the teachings of our leader Karl Marx,
we will build the ultimate communist
community, one body and hundreds,
maybe thousands, of brains inside
working together to form a super
human intellect capable of curing
disease, stopping all war, and
ruling the world with a benevolent
fist. We will take a wife, a woman
of uncommon beauty and intellect, who
is, as yet, still an infant herself."
668,LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D),668,"Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella
DeMent."
669,LOTTE,669,"Does Floris know that she's the
chosen?"
670,LESTER,670,"Well, I tried to explain it to her,
but..."
671,MAXINE,671,"You still there, sweets?"
672,MALKOVICH,672,"Yeah. I've figured out how to hold
on as long as I want. Oddly enough,
it's all in the wrists."
673,MAXINE,673,Wow.
674,MAXINE,674,"Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey."
675,MALKOVICH,675,You mean with Malkovich?
676,MAXINE,676,I'd love to see your work.
677,MALKOVICH,677,Really? Yeah. Okay.
678,MALKOVICH (CONT'D),678,"I'll do something I call ""Craig's
Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."""
679,MAXINE,679,That was incredible. You're brilliant!
680,MALKOVICH,680,"You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing
with dolls."
681,MAXINE,681,"You're right, my darling, it's
so much more. It's playing with
people!"
682,MAXINE,682,Stay in him forever?
683,MALKOVICH,683,No!
684,MALKOVICH,684,"But how will we make a living,
my love, if our clientele doesn't
have access to our product?"
685,MAXINE,685,"Well, we'll have all the money in
Malkovich's bank account, plus he
still gets acting work occasionally."
686,MALKOVICH,686,No! Please!
687,MALKOVICH,687,"Shut up, will you? We're trying to
think here."
688,MALKOVICH,688,"It is sort of like being a puppeteer.
I like that about it."
689,MAXINE,689,"No one would ever have to know its
not him."
690,MALKOVICH,690,"Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?
What if we presented Malkovich as the
world's most complicated puppet and
me as the only puppeteer sophisticated
enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor
with the Great Mantini!"
691,MAXINE,691,"Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!"
692,LOTTE,692,"I have sinned, unwittingly, against
the community. And for this I am
truly sorry."
693,MAN #2,693,W-w-what's it like on the inside?
694,LOTTE,694,"Oh, it's glorious. It's indescribable."
695,MAN #2,695,"Oooh, I wanna go. I wanna go. I say
it's time."
696,LESTER,696,"Perhaps you're right, Terry. We're
all prepared, and perhaps this
Schwartz fellow is forcing our hand
a bit. We will enter the portal
tonight!"
697,MALKOVICH,697,Shut up!
698,MALKOVICH,698,"Sorry, dear, I lost control for
a minute."
699,MAXINE,699,"It's okay, my sweet."
700,LESTER,700,"Aaaahhhh, the portal!"
701,LOTTE,701,You bastard!
702,LESTER,702,No! Don't harm the vessel!
703,LOTTE,703,"It's Craig in there, I can tell."
704,LESTER,704,"I understand, but we must protect
the vessel at all costs."
705,LESTER,705,"Please, Craig, please step aside
and allow us to have what is
rightfully ours."
706,CRAIG,706,"Squatter's rights, Lester."
707,MAXINE,707,"Now excuse us, we have an
entertainment legend to create."
708,LESTER,708,"Clear the way for them, my friends.
They will be dealt with in due time."
709,LESTER (CONT'D),709,"Now, let's see what we can do to
salvage this portal... for the sake
of all that is good."
710,AGENT,710,"Of course, send him right in. Don't
ever keep him waiting again. Do you
understand?"
711,AGENT (CONT'D),711,"John! Great to see you! Sorry about
the cunt at reception."
712,MALKOVICH,712,This is my fiancee Maxine.
713,AGENT,713,"Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about
the cunt at reception. Please have a
seat."
714,AGENT (CONT'D),714,Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?
715,MAXINE,715,No thanks.
716,AGENT,716,"Teresa, get me a chicken soup."
717,AGENT,717,Chicken soup?
718,MALKOVICH,718,"I'll get right to the point, Larry.
I'm a puppet now..."
719,AGENT,719,Okay.
720,MALKOVICH,720,"I'm being controlled by the world's
greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz..."
721,AGENT,721,"Oh yeah, he's good."
722,MALKOVICH,722,"... and I want to show off his skills
by performing a one-puppet
extravaganza in Reno."
723,MAXINE,723,Vegas.
724,MALKOVICH,724,Vegas. Can you arrange that?
725,AGENT,725,"Sure, sure. Just let me make a
couple of calls."
726,MAN #2,726,"That's the last of it, boss."
727,LESTER,727,"Well, let's see what we've got
here."
728,LESTER (V.O.),728,"My God, where am I? This seems so
familiar."
729,LESTER (V.O.),729,"My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker!
Aaaahhhh! Aaaah!"
730,DIRECTOR,730,Cut!
731,LESTER (V.O.),731,"Oh, I'm just the actor in that
Twilight Zone episode."
732,LESTER,732,"Thank you all for your efforts,
but I'm afraid we can no longer get
into Malkovich through the portal."
733,LOTTE,733,Why not? I need to get in there!
734,LESTER,734,"I'm not certain, my dear, but I
believe your husband has somehow
psychically diverted the route."
735,LOTTE,735,"That bastard! I'll gladly dispose
of him in the name of the order, Son
of Malkovich."
736,LESTER,736,"I'm afraid that no physical harm
must come to him as long as he
inhabits the vessel."
737,MAN #3,737,"Oooh, I got an idea! What if we
build another portal to Malkovich,
like around back, and sneak in that
way?"
738,MAN #4,738,"Only Captain Mertin knew how to build
a portal, dummy, and he's dead!"
739,LESTER,739,"Actually, my friends, I suppose its
time I told you, I'm Captain James
Mertin."
740,LESTER (CONT'D),740,"You see, Lester is an anagram for
Mertin."
741,LESTER (CONT'D),741,"It used to work, I'm sure of it."
742,LESTER (CONT'D),742,"Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am."
743,MAN #3,743,"How can this be? I thought you were
only one hundred and five years old.
Mertin would have to be..."
744,LESTER,744,"I'm two hundred and five, truth be
told."
745,WOMAN #1,745,"You don't look a day over one
hundred and five, Captain. What's
your secret?"
746,LESTER,746,"Lots of carrot juice, little lady.
That, and a deal with the Devil."
747,MAN #2,747,"So what exactly are you saying? Are
we in cahoots with the Dark Master
here?"
748,LESTER,748,Surprise.
749,LESTER (CONT'D),749,"Wait! It's not that bad! When we get
into Malkovich, we still get to rule
the world, just like I told you. The
only difference is that we rule in the
name of evil, instead of good."
750,MAN #3,750,That's the only difference?
751,LESTER,751,Absolutely.
752,LESTER (CONT'D),752,So anyway...
753,LOTTE,753,"Well, I for one, am resigning. I will
not serve evil. I am ashamed of all
of you."
754,LESTER,754,"My dear, let me assure you that when
we attain power, it will be much more
pleasant for those inside Malkovich,
than for those outside."
755,LOTTE,755,I'll take my chances.
756,LESTER,756,Anybody else?
757,WOMAN #1,757,Do we get to wear a crown?
758,LESTER,758,But of course.
759,WOMAN #1,759,Count me in.
760,LESTER,760,"Good. I think its time to beckon
Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us
out of this pickle."
761,FLEMMER,761,"Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest,
I didn't anticipate this."
762,LESTER,762,"And as I said, sir, we can't very
well exert physical persuasion upon
the sacred vessel Malkovich."
763,FLEMMER,763,"Right, Lester. I heard you the first
time. I'm not a dummy."
764,LESTER,764,"Didn't mean to imply that you were,
sir."
765,FLEMMER,765,"Look, I'm going back to my house
to ponder this. So stay calm and
keep track of Schwartz's comings
and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose
of Schwartz's wife, will you?"
766,FLEMMER,766,Nice to meet you all.
767,LOTTE,767,"Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're
not human. People are treacherous
and greedy and corrupt. I've lost
my heart to two of them and I almost
lost my soul to another. And I'm no
better. Look at the way I keep you,
locked in cages, for my own enjoyment.
Well, I've been in a cage too, my
friends. Literally and figuratively.
So tonight I set you free."
768,LOTTE (CONT'D),768,"Good-bye, friends."
769,LOTTE (CONT'D),769,"Hello, friend"
770,LOTTE,770,"They've come to kill me, Elijah. See,
I know too much. I should get the
door. It's impolite to keep death
waiting."
771,MAXINE,771,"This is it, lover. You're stepping
onto that stage a nobody and
presto-change-o, you're coming
back the greatest puppeteer the
world has ever seen."
772,MALKOVICH,772,"I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting
me hard today."
773,MAXINE,773,"Doesn't he know how important
tonight is to us?"
774,MALKOVICH,774,He's a selfish bastard.
775,ANNOUNCER (O.S.),775,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is the
great privilege of the Luxor hotel
and Casino to present Craig Schwartz
and his magical puppet John
Malkovich."
776,LESTER,776,Blasphemous bastard.
777,LESTER (CONT'D),777,Pretty good though.
778,USHER,778,"Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting
you tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid
there's not an empty seat in the
entire house."
779,MANTINI,779,Make one empty.
780,USHER,780,Y-y-y-es sir.
781,LESTER,781,Not too shabby.
782,MANTINI,782,Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.
783,LOTTE,783,"They're going to take over the
world, Elijah. Evil will reign.
But, then, evil already reigns,
doesn't it? So what difference
does it make if John Malkovich
is wearing the fucking crown while
it's reigning?"
784,FLEMMER,784,It's open.
785,LESTER,785,"It's just me, boss. I brought
croissants."
786,FLEMMER,786,"Have a seat. I wracking my brain
over this Malkovich thing."
787,LESTER,787,"We saw his show at the Luxor last
night."
788,FLEMMER,788,Vegas? What'd you think?
789,LESTER,789,"The kid's got talent. You've never
seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz
had him up there singing and dancing.
Impressions."
790,FLEMMER,790,Impressions? Those are hard.
791,LESTER,791,"Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad
we can't kill him."
792,FLEMMER,792,"I suppose I could come to him in a
dream. I don't know. That's the best
I can think of right now."
793,LESTER,793,A scary dream?
794,FLEMMER,794,"No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary
dream."
795,LESTER,795,I like that.
796,MALKOVICH,796,"They love me, darling! ""Craig Schwartz
is fantastic!""  The New York Times.
""If only Craig Schwartz had always
been inside Malkovich!""  Women's Wear
Daily. ""Craig Schwartz - The world's
greatest puppeteer!""  Paul Wunder,
WBAI Radio."
797,MAXINE,797,"Oh, darling. It's a dream come true.
We're going to ride this straight to
the top."
798,MALKOVICH,798,Sleepy suddenly.
799,MAXINE,799,"Busy day, my little fire chief. Why
don't you climb into bed, and I'll
meet you there in just..."
800,CRAIG,800,Who are you?
801,FLEMMER,801,I am the Devil.
802,CRAIG,802,Oh.
803,FLEMMER,803,Leave Malkovich. He is mine.
804,CRAIG,804,Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.
805,MAXINE,805,"Bad dream, darling?"
806,MALKOVICH,806,I've got to leave Malkovich.
807,MAXINE,807,You've got to be kidding.
808,MALKOVICH,808,"I just had the most horrifying
nightmare. The devil was in it."
809,MAXINE,809,"Malkovich is our meal ticket. You
can't back out because of some
stupid dream."
810,FLEMMER,810,Shit.
811,MALKOVICH,811,"Honey, we can be happy and poor
together."
812,MAXINE,812,"Perhaps you'll want to consult that
Ouija board again."
813,MAXINE (CONT'D),813,Yeah what?!
814,MALKOVICH,814,Derek Mantini!
815,MANTINI,815,"Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show."
816,MALKOVICH,816,Did you see the reviews?
817,MANTINI,817,"Yeah, I saw them"
818,MALKOVICH,818,"Because if you missed any, I just
happen to have copies here you can
take with you when you leave now."
819,MAXINE,819,"I'm Maxine. I produced the evening
with Malkovich."
820,MANTINI,820,"Very impressive. I could use a
producer with your vision. And
other outstanding attributes."
821,MALKOVICH,821,She's not available.
822,MANTINI,822,"We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see."
823,MAXINE,823,"Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see."
824,MANTINI,824,"I won't waste your time Schwartz, or
more importantly, mine. Here's my
proposal: There's only room in this
world for one ""World's Greatest
Puppeteer.""  Correct? So let's allow
the puppet-going public to crown
their king."
825,MALKOVICH,825,How do we do that?
826,MANTINI,826,"A friendly competition, if you will.
Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.
Truman puppet appear opposite each
other in a play. Not some Vegas
Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play
that requires actual acting. The
audience decides who is more deserving
of the title. The losing puppeteer
bows out graciously. Goes back to
obscurity as a file clerk."
827,MALKOVICH,827,What's the play?
828,MANTINI,828,"Say... ""Equus""? It's got everything."
829,MALKOVICH,829,Never heard of it.
830,MANTINI,830,"Broadway's finest three hours. It's
about the suppression of the
individual. Conformity as God in
modern society."
831,MALKOVICH,831,Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
832,MANTINI,832,"Nothing but acting to hide behind,
buddy-boy."
833,MALKOVICH,833,"I'm not afraid. I toured for a year
with the National Puppet Company's
production of ""Long Day's Journey
Into Night."""
834,MANTINI,834,Great then.
835,MALKOVICH,835,Is there dancing?
836,MANTINI,836,No.
837,MALKOVICH,837,Who needs dancing?
838,LESTER,838,"How'd it go? Did you say the
philodendron gets water or no?"
839,FLEMMER,839,"No, for God's sake, I just watered
it yesterday."
840,FLEMMER,840,"It almost went well. I gave a pretty
good dream, but circumstances arose."
841,LESTER,841,What kind of circumstances?
842,FLEMMER,842,"Maxine says she'll leave him if he
leaves Malkovich, plus he's been
challenged to a puppet-duel by
Mantini."
843,LESTER,843,The Great Mantini?
844,FLEMMER,844,"No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course
the Great Mantini!"
845,LESTER,845,"Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I
saw him do ""Tru"" with his sixty
foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational."
846,FLEMMER,846,But I think I have another plan.
847,LESTER,847,Do tell. I love a good plan.
848,FLEMMER,848,Why are you being like this?
849,LESTER,849,"I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me
the plan."
850,FLEMMER,850,"Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will
leave Malkovich, right? So, if he
needs it, I help Mantini's performance
a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the
show."
851,LESTER,851,"Can you do that? I mean, do you know
anything about puppetry?"
852,FLEMMER,852,"I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can
handle it."
853,LESTER,853,"I was just asking. No disrespect
intended."
854,FLEMMER,854,Fine. Let's drop it.
855,LESTER,855,"Fine. I mean, it's not like I was
doubting you, it's just that I know
puppetry is a skill that takes a long
time to acquire."
856,FLEMMER,856,Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
857,LESTER,857,"Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen
table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a
letter from Alex Trebek."
858,ELIJAH (SUBTITLES),858,"You've got to tell Craig what's going
on. He must never leave Malkovich."
859,LOTTE,859,"I'm glad you learned sign language,
Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging.
I'm tired of this conversation. I'm
tired period. What has the world ever
done for me that I should feel
personally responsible for saving it?"
860,ELIJAH (SUBTITLES),860,"It is better to light one candle than
curse the darkness. I learned that
from you."
861,LOTTE,861,What have I become?
862,HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET,862,Do you dream often?
863,MALKOVICH,863,Do you?
864,HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET,864,"It's my job to ask the questions.
Yours to answer them."
865,MALKOVICH,865,Says who?
866,HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET,866,Says me. Do you dream often?
867,MALKOVICH,867,Do you?
868,MAXINE,868,"Keep your eyes in your pants, old
timer."
869,THEATERGOER #1,869,"That Truman puppet is downright
boring as the psychiatrist."
870,THEATERGOER #2,870,"It's a wooden performance, really.
Get it? Wooden?"
871,THEATERGOER #3,871,"What's with the Malkovich puppet?
He was much better in Vegas when he
played the piano with his feet."
872,THEATERGOER #4,872,"I hate it when they try to stretch.
It's like Woody Allen."
873,THEATERGOER #5,873,"They both stink! I'm going across the
street to second act Miss Saigon."
874,MAXINE,874,"You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics,
lover, 'cause right now you're running
neck and neck with the dead president.
And you're both in last place."
875,CHARLES NELSON REILLY,875,"You're doing beautifully, my boy. I
wept at the speech about your wife."
876,CHARLES NELSON REILLY,876,What the hell? Nyong-nyong!
877,HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET,877,"I can hear the creature's voice. It's
calling me out of the black cave of
the Psyche. I shove in my dim little
torch, and there he stands -- waiting
for me. He raises his matted head. He
opens his great, square teeth and says"
878,HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET,878,"'Why? ... Why me? ... Why --
ultimately -- Me? ... Do you really
imagine you can account for Me?
Totally, infallibly, inevitably
account for Me? ... Poor Dr. Dysart!'"
879,MALKOVICH,879,"Eyes! ... White eyes -- never closed!
Eyes like flames -- coming -- coming!
... God seest! ... God seest! ... NO!"
880,HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET,880,"Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ...
Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back!
Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In ...
Out ... In ... Out ... That's it ...
In. Out .. In ... Out ..."
881,AUDIENCE MEMBER,881,"That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine
actor."
882,FLEMMER,882,Bastard is stealing my thunder.
883,HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET,883,"All right! I'll take it away! He'll be
delivered from madness. What then?
He'll feel himself acceptable! What
then?"
884,HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D),884,"I'll heal the rash on his body. I'll
erase the welts cut into his body by
flying manes."
885,HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D),885,"You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses
will be quite safe. You'll save your
pennies every week, till you can
change that scooter into a car..."
886,ACTUAL TRUMAN,886,Where am I? Aren't I dead?
887,ACTUAL TRUMAN,887,Vote for Mantini!
888,MALKOVICH,888,"Good-bye, Maxine."
889,MAXINE,889,Whatever.
890,MALKOVICH,890,I'm back! My nightmare is over.
891,FLEMMER,891,"Okay, now!"
892,MALKOVICH,892,"I am your earthly king! Kneel before
me!"
893,CROWD,893,"Hail Malkovich, king of the damned."
894,MALKOVICH,894,"Greetings, my lowly subjects."
895,FLORIS,895,"Great things, my lonely subtext?"
896,MALKOVICH,896,"Boy, be careful what you wish for."
897,MALKOVICH,897,"Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,
will you?"
898,MALKOVICH (CONT'D),898,"I am bored. You will dance for your
king now."
899,MALKOVICH (CONT'D),899,"Faster! Faster, my little trained
monkeys!"
900,ELIJAH (SUBTITLES),900,"Must you take this terrible demon
on yourself, my love?"
901,LOTTE,901,"Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter
Malkovich and destroy him from the
inside. If not me, who?"
902,ELIJAH (SUBTITLES),902,"If there was any way I could go in
your place. But I'm only a monkey
and..."
903,LOTTE,903,"Hush, sweetheart."
904,LOTTE,904,"I'll be with you always, my friends.
Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll
rejoin you with wings and a beak."
905,ELIJAH (SUBTITLES),905,"Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings
and a halo."
906,PARROT,906,Good-bye. Good-bye.
907,LOTTE,907,My God!
908,CRAIG,908,"I'm so glad you're safe. You look
really wonderful."
909,LOTTE,909,"I'm in love. For the first time.
It's funny, but when it happens to
you, there's no question."
910,CRAIG,910,He's a lucky man.
911,CRAIG,911,Do I know him?
912,LOTTE,912,It's Elijah.
913,CRAIG,913,The iguana?
914,LOTTE,914,The monkey.
915,CRAIG,915,"Oh, right. As long as you're happy.
I'm sure he's a better lover than I
ever was."
916,LOTTE,916,A better friend.
917,CRAIG,917,I'm sorry for everything.
918,LOTTE,918,"It's okay, Craig. It all worked out,
in an odd sort of way."
919,CRAIG,919,"You came up here looking for the
portal?"
920,LOTTE,920,"Yeah. I was going to kill him from
the inside."
921,CRAIG,921,"And yourself too in the process. God,
you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I
see that before?"
922,LOTTE,922,"You saw it once. Now you see it again.
That's life, isn't it? And you were
up here to try the same thing, weren't
you?"
923,CRAIG,923,"I suppose. But they got here first,
the lousy bastards. So now it's all
over, I guess."
924,LOTTE,924,"I don't know. There's a small
community of us. We have a place they
don't know about. We're happy. We'll
keep trying to figure out a way. Come
stay with us. Join the struggle."
925,CRAIG,925,"You'll have me, after all I've done
to you?"
926,LOTTE,926,People make mistakes.
927,CRAIG,927,"I'm through with puppets, Lotte.
I just want you to know that."
928,LOTTE,928,I know.
929,CRAIG,929,"I'd like to be a farmer. I want to
help things grow, to encourage life.
Do you and your friends need a farmer?"
930,LOTTE,930,"Sure. We could really use a farmer.
We'd be grateful for the help."
931,LOTTE,931,"Also, I think, you know, if you
wouldn't mind too terribly, a little
puppet show every once in a while,
would do a lot to lift our spirits.
You know, if you wouldn't mind too
terribly."
932,LOTTE (CONT'D),932,Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.
933,CRAIG,933,"I love you, Lotte."
934,MANTINI,934,"I can't wait to see where you and your
friends live, Lotte."
935,LOTTE (O.S.),935,"It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden."
936,FLEMMER,936,"One serpent, coming up."
