1,CORDÉ,1,"... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I..."
2,AMIDALA,2,No!... No!... No!...
3,AMIDALA,3,I should not have come back.
4,CAPTAIN TYPHO,4,"M'Lady, you are still in danger."
5,CAPTAIN TYPHO,5,"This vote is very important. You did
your duty and Cordé did hers. Now
come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,
please!"
6,MAS AMEDDA,6,"Order! We shall have order! The motion
for the Republic to commission an army
takes precedent, and that is what we
will vote on at this time."
7,PALPATINE,7,"...My esteemed colleagues, excuse
me... I have just received some
tragic and disturbing news. Senator
Amidala of the Naboo system... Has
been assassinated!"
8,"PALPATINE
(continued)",8,"This grievous blow is especially
personal to me. Before I became
Chancellor, I served Amidala when
she was Queen. She was a great
leader who fought for justice, not
only in this honourable assembly,
but also on her home planet. She
was so loved she could have been
elected queen for life. She
believed in public service, and
she fervently believed in
democracy. Her death is a great
loss to us all. We will all mourn
her as a relentless champion of
freedom... and as a dear friend."
9,SENATOR ASK AAK,9,"How many more Senators will die
before this civil strife ends! We
must confront these rebels now,
and they need an army to do it."
10,AMBASSADOR DARSANA,10,"Why weren't the Jedi able to stop
this assassination? We are no
longer safe, under their protection."
11,ORN FREE TAA,11,"The Republic needs more security
now! Before it comes to war."
12,PALPATINE,12,"Must I remind the Senator from
Malastare that negotiations are
continuing with the separatists.
Peace is our objective here... not
war."
13,AMIDALA,13,"My noble colleagues, I concur with
the Supreme Chancellor. At all
costs, we do not want war!"
14,PALPATINE,14,"It is with great surprise and
joy the chair recognises the
Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala."
15,PADMÉ,15,"Less than an hour ago, an
assassination attempt was made
against my life. One of my
bodyguards and six  others were
ruthlessly and senselessly
murdered. I was the target but,
more importantly, I believe this
security measure before you, was
the target. I have led the
opposition to build an army... but
there is someone in this body who
will stop at nothing to assure it's
passage..."
16,PADMÉ,16,"I warn you, if you vote to create
this army, war will follow. I
have experienced the misery of war
first-hand; I do not wish to do it
again."
17,PADMÉ,17,"Wake up, Senators... you must wake
up! If you offer the separatists
violence, they can only show us
violence in return! Many will
lose their lives. All will lose
their freedom. This decision
could very well destroy the very
foundation of our great Republic.
I pray you do not let fear push
you into a disastrous decision.
Vote down this security measure,
which is nothing less than a
declaration of war! Does anyone
here want that? I cannot believe
they do."
18,ORN FREE TAA,18,"My motion to defer the vote must
be dealt with first. That is the
rule of law."
19,PALPATINE,19,"Due to the lateness of the hour
and the seriousness of this
motion, we will take up these
matters tomorrow. Until then, the
Senate stands adjourned."
20,PALPATINE,20,"I don't know how much longer I can
hold off the vote, my friends.
More and more star systems are
joining the separatists."
21,MACE WINDU,21,If they do break away -
22,PALPATINE,22,No! I will not let that happen!
23,MACE WINDU,23,"But if they do, you must realise
there aren't enough Jedi to
protect the Republic. We are
keepers of the peace, not soldiers."
24,PALPATINE,24,"Master Yoda, do you think it will
really come to war?"
25,YODA,25,"Worse than war, I fear... Much
worse."
26,PALPATINE,26,What?
27,MACE WINDU,27,"What do you sense, Master?"
28,YODA,28,"Impossible to see ... The Dark Side
clouds everything. But this I am
sure of -"
29,(opens his eyes),29,Do their duty the Jedi will.
30,DAR WAC,30,"The loyalist committee has arrived,
my Lord."
31,PALPATINE,31,Send them in.
32,YODA,32,"With you the force is strong...
young Senator. To see you alive
brings warm feeling to my heart."
33,PADMÉ,33,"Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you
have any idea who was behind
the attack?"
34,MACE WINDU,34,"Our intelligence points to
disgruntled spice miners, on
the moons of Naboo."
35,PADMÉ,35,"I don't wish to disagree but I
think that Count Dooku was behind
it."
36,MACE WINDU,36,"You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
was once a Jedi. He wouldn't
assassinate anyone, it is not in
his character."
37,KI-ADI-MUNDI,37,"He is a political idealist, not
a murderer."
38,YODA,38,"In dark times nothing is what it
appears to be, but the fact remains
Senator, in grave danger you are."
39,PALPATINE,39,"Count Dooku has always avoided
any kind of conflict. It appears
he has no desire to start a war.
Why would he kill you? To what end?"
40,PADMÉ,40,"I don't know, but everything in my
being tells me he was behind it..."
41,PALPATINE,41,"Master Jedi, may I suggest that
the Senator be placed under the
protection of your graces."
42,BAIL ORGANA,42,"Do you think that is a wise use
of manpower during these stressful
times?"
43,PADMÉ,43,"Chancellor, if I may comment, I
do not believe the..."
44,PALPATINE,44,"...""situation is that serious.""
No, but I do, Senator."
45,PADMÉ,45,"Chancellor, please! I don't want
any more guards!"
46,PALPATINE,46,"I realise all too well that
additional security might be
disruptive for you, but perhaps
someone you are familiar with... an
old friend like... Master Kenobi..."
47,MACE WINDU,47,"That's possible. He has just
returned from a Border dispute on
Ansion."
48,PALPATINE,48,"You must remember him, M'Lady...
he watched over you during the
blockade conflict."
49,PADMÉ,49,"This is not necessary, Chancellor."
50,PALPATINE,50,"Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I
will rest easier. We had a big
scare today. The thought of
losing you is unbearable."
51,MACE WINDU,51,"I will have Obi-Wan report to you
immediately, M'Lady."
52,YODA,52,"Too little about yourself you
worry, Senator, and too much about
politics. Be mindful of your
danger, Padmé. Accept our help."
53,PALPATINE,53,"I will not like this Republiv, that
has stood for over a thousand
years, be split in two"
54,JAR JAR,54,"Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen
to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!"
55,OBI-WAN,55,"It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar."
56,JAR JAR,56,"Oops! Wheresa mesa manners?
Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I
completely forgot myself for
a moment there. I have had to learn
Diplodiaclect... speak it like a
native now. Don't really see the
point, actually, but members of
the Senate seem to prefer it..."
57,"JAR JAR
(continuing)",57,"...and this, I take it, is your
apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie?
Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?"
58,(Looks at Anakin),58,"Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen!
Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no
believen."
59,ANAKIN,59,"Hi, Jar Jar."
60,JAR JAR,60,Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!
61,JAR JAR,61,"Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh,
dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten
myself again."
62,OBI-WAN,62,"It's a great pleasure to see you again,
M'Lady."
63,PADMÉ,63,"It has been far too long Master
Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths
have crossed again... but I must
warn you that I think your
presence here is unnecessary."
64,OBI-WAN,64,"I'm sure the Jedi Council have
their reasons."
65,PADMÉ,65,Annie??
66,(stares),66,My goodness you've grown.
67,"ANAKIN
(trying to be smooth)",67,"So have you... grown more
beautiful, I mean... and much
shorter... for a Senator, I mean."
68,PADMÉ,68,"Oh Annie, you'll always be that
little boy I knew on Tatooine."
69,OBI-WAN,69,"Our presence will be invisible,
M'Lady."
70,CAPTAIN TYPHO,70,"I am very grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi. The situation is
more dangerous than the Senator
will admit."
71,PADMÉ,71,"I don't need more security, I need
answers. I want to know who is
trying to kill me."
72,"OBI-WAN
(frowning)",72,"We're here to protect you
Senator, not to start an
investigation."
73,ANAKIN,73,"We will find out who is trying to
kill you Padmé, I promise you."
74,OBI-WAN,74,"We are not going to exceed our
mandate, my young Padawan learner."
75,ANAKIN,75,"I meant in the interest of
protecting her, Master, of course."
76,OBI-WAN,76,"We are not going through this
exercise again, Anakin. You will
pay attention to my lead."
77,ANAKIN,77,Why?
78,OBI-WAN,78,What??!!
79,ANAKIN,79,"Why else do you think we were
assigned to her, if not to find
the killer? Protection is a job
for local security... not Jedi.
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our
mandate."
80,OBI-WAN,80,"We will do as the Council has
instructed, and you will learn
your place, young one."
81,PADMÉ,81,"Perhaps with merely your presence,
the mysteries surrounding this
threat will be revealed.  Now if
you will excuse me I will retire."
82,CAPTAIN TYPHO,82,"Well, I know I feel a lot better
having you here.
I'll have an officer on every
floor and I'll be at the command
centre downstairs."
83,JAR JAR,83,"Mesa busten wit happiness seein
Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad
times, bombad times."
84,ANAKIN,84,"She didn't even recognise me, Jar
Jar. I thought about her every
day since we parted... and she's
forgotten me completely."
85,JAR JAR,85,"Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
see-en her in longo time."
86,OBI-WAN,86,"Anakin, you're focusing on the
Negative again. Be mindful of your
thoughts. She was glad to see us.
Now lets check the security here."
87,ANAKIN,87,"Yes, my master."
88,MACE WINDU,88,"Why couldn't we see this attack on
the Senator?"
89,YODA,89,"Masking the future, is this
disturbance in the Force."
90,MACE WINDU,90,"The propecy is coming true, the
Dark Side is growing."
91,YODA,91,"And only those who have turned to
the Dark Side can sense the
possibilities of the future. Only
going through the Dark Side can we
see."
92,MACE WINDU,92,"It's been ten years, and the Sith
still have no shown themselves.
Do you think they are behind this?"
93,YODA,93,"...Out there, they are. A
certainty that is."
94,MACE WINDU,94,"Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice
will be able to bring balance to
the Force?"
95,YODA,95,"Only if he chooses to follow his
destiny."
96,OBI-WAN,96,"Captain Typho has more than enough
men downstairs. No assassin will
try that way. Any activity up
here?"
97,ANAKIN,97,"Quiet as a tomb. I don't like
just waiting here for something to
happen to her."
98,OBI-WAN,98,What's going on?
99,ANAKIN,99,"She covered that camera. I don't
think she liked me watching her."
100,OBI-WAN,100,What is she thinking?
101,ANAKIN,101,"She programmed Artoo to warn us if
there's an intruder."
102,OBI-WAN,102,"It's not an intruder I'm worried
about. There are many other ways
to kill a Senator."
103,ANAKIN,103,"I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin. Don't we, Master?"
104,OBI-WAN,104,You're using her as bait??
105,ANAKIN,105,"It was her idea... No harm will
come to her. I can sense
everything going on in that room.
Trust me."
106,OBI-WAN,106,"It's too risky... and your senses
aren't that attuned, young
apprentice."
107,ANAKIN,107,And yours are?
108,OBI-WAN,108,Possibly.
109,OBI-WAN,109,You look tired.
110,ANAKIN,110,"I don't sleep well, anymore."
111,OBI-WAN,111,Because of your mother?
112,ANAKIN,112,"I don't know why I keep dreaming
About her now. I haven't seen her
since I was little."
113,OBI-WAN,113,Dreams pass in time.
114,ANAKIN,114,"I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just
Being around her again is...
intoxicating."
115,OBI-WAN,115,"Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they
betray you. You've made a
commitment to the Jedi order... a
commitment not easily broken...
and don't forget she's a
politician. They're not to be
trusted."
116,ANAKIN,116,"She's not like the others in the
Senate, Master."
117,OBI-WAN,117,"It's been my experience that
Senators are only focused on
pleasing those who fund their
campaigns... and they are more
than willing to forget the
niceties of democracy to get those
funds."
118,ANAKIN,118,"Not another lecture, Master. Not
on the economics of politics....
It's too early in the morning... and
besides, you're generalising. The
Chancellor doesn't appear to
be corrupt."
119,OBI-WAN,119,"Palpatine's a politician, I've
observed that he is very clever at
following the passions and
prejudices of the Senators."
120,ANAKIN,120,"I think he is a good man. My
instincts are very positive
about..."
121,OBI-WAN,121,"I sense it, too."
122,ANAKIN,122,Stay here!
123,OBI-WAN,123,I have a bad feeling about this.
124,ANAKIN,124,"That was wacky! I almost lost you
in the traffic."
125,OBI-WAN,125,What took you so long?
126,ANAKIN,126,"Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't
find a speeder I really liked,
with an open cockpit... and with
the right speed capabilities...
and then you know I had to get a
really gonzo color..."
127,OBI-WAN,127,"If you'd spend as much time
working on your saber skills as
you do on your wit, young Padawan,
you would rival Master Yoda as a
swordsman."
128,ANAKIN,128,I thought I already did.
129,OBI-WAN,129,"Only in your mind, my very young
apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!"
130,ANAKIN,130,"Sorry, I forgot you don't like
flying, Master."
131,OBI-WAN,131,"I don't mind flying... but
what you're doing is suicide!"
132,ANAKIN,132,"Master, you know I've been flying
since before I could walk. I'm very
good at this."
133,OBI-WAN,133,Just slow down!
134,"OBI-WAN
(continuing)",134,Wait! Don't go in there!
135,"OBI-WAN
(continuing)",135,"You know I don't like it when you
do that!"
136,ANAKIN,136,"Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this
guy's gonna kill himself any
minute now!"
137,OBI-WAN,137,"What are you doing? He's gonna
blast me!"
138,ANAKIN,138,Right - this isn't working.
139,OBI-WAN,139,That was too close!
140,ANAKIN,140,Clear that!
141,OBI-WAN,141,What??
142,ANAKIN,142,"Clear the flag! We're losing
power! Hurry!"
143,OBI-WAN,143,"Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I
don't  like it when you do that!"
144,ANAKIN,144,"So sorry, Master."
145,OBI-WAN,145,"It's dangerous near those power
couplings! Slow down! Don't go
through there!"
146,"OBI-WAN
(continuing)",146,"Yiiii, what are you doing?"
147,ANAKIN,147,"Sorry, Master!"
148,"OBI-WAN
(sarcastically)",148,"Oh, that was good..."
149,ANAKIN,149,That was crazy!!!
150,"ANAKIN
(continuing)",150,"Ahh, damn."
151,OBI-WAN,151,Stop!!
152,ANAKIN,152,"No, we can make it."
153,OBI-WAN,153,"I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
crazy."
154,ANAKIN,154,But it worked... we made it.
155,"OBI-WAN
(angrily)",155,"It didn't work... we've stalled!
And you almost got us killed!"
156,ANAKIN,156,I think we're still alive.
157,"OBI-WAN
(very angrily)",157,It was stupid!
158,"ANAKIN
(sheepishly)",158,I could have made it...
159,"OBI-WAN
(furious)",159,"But you didn't!!! And now we've
lost him."
160,ANAKIN,160,No we didnt...
161,OBI-WAN,161,"Where are you going?! He went
down there, the other way."
162,ANAKIN,162,This is a shortcut... I think.
163,OBI-WAN,163,"What do you mean, You think?
What kind of shortcut?! He went
completely the other way! Youve
lost him!"
164,ANAKIN,164,"Master, if we keep this chase
going, that creeps gonna end up
deep fried. Personally, Id very
much like to find out who in the
hell he is and who hes working
for..."
165,"OBI-WAN
(sarcastic)",165,"Oh, so thats why were going in
the wrong direction."
166,"OBI-WAN
(continuing)",166,"Well, you lost him."
167,ANAKIN,167,"Im deeply sorry, Master."
168,"ANAKIN
(continuing)",168,Excuse me for a moment.
169,OBI-WAN,169,Anakin!
170,ANAKIN,170,"She went into that club, Master."
171,OBI-WAN,171,Patience.
172,OBI-WAN,172,Here. Next time try not to lose it.
173,ANAKIN,173,"Sorry, Master."
174,OBI-WAN,174,"A Jedi's saber is his most
precious possession."
175,ANAKIN,175,"Yes, Master."
176,OBI-WAN,176,"He must keep it with him at all
times."
177,ANAKIN,177,"I know, Master."
178,OBI-WAN,178,This weapon is your life!
179,ANAKIN,179,I've heard this lesson before...
180,OBI-WAN,180,"But, you haven't learned anything,
Anakin."
181,ANAKIN,181,"I try, Master."
182,OBI-WAN,182,"Why do I think you are going to be
the death of me?!"
183,ANAKIN,183,"Don't say that Master... You're
the closest thing I have to a
father... I love you. I don't want
to cause you pain."
184,OBI-WAN,184,Then why don't you listen to me?!
185,ANAKIN,185,"I will. I'll do better, I promise."
186,OBI-WAN,186,Do you see him him?
187,ANAKIN,187,I think he's a she...
188,OBI-WAN,188,Then be extra careful...
189,(nods to a room),189,Check it out.
190,ANAKIN,190,"Where are you going, Master?"
191,OBI-WAN,191,To get a drink.
192,ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO,192,Wanna buy some death sticks?
193,OBI-WAN,193,"You don't want to sell me death-
sticks."
194,ELAN,194,"I don't want to sell you death-
sticks."
195,OBI-WAN,195,"You want to go home and rethink
your life."
196,ELAN,196,"I want to go home and rethink my
life."
197,ANAKIN,197,"Easy... Official business. Go
back to your drinks."
198,OBI-WAN,198,"Do you know who it was you were
trying to kill?"
199,ZAM WESSEL,199,The Senator from Naboo.
200,OBI-WAN,200,Who hired you?
201,ZAM WESSEL,201,It was just a job.
202,ANAKIN,202,Tell us!
203,ZAM WESSEL,203,"That Senator's gonna die soon
anyway, and the next one won't
make the same mistake I did..."
204,OBI-WAN,204,"This wound's going to need
treatment."
205,ANAKIN,205,"Who hired you? Tell us... tell us
now!"
206,ZAM,206,It was a Bounty Hunter called...
207,OBI-WAN,207,Toxic Dart...
208,PADMÉ,208,"Representative Binks. I know I can
count on you."
209,JAR JAR,209,Yousa betchen mesa bottums.
210,PADMÉ,210,What?!
211,"JAR JAR
(coughs, recovers)",211,"Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean,
I am honoured to accept this heavy
burden. I take on this
responsibility with deep humility
tinged with an overwhelming pride."
212,(pompously),212,"It is not every day that I am
called upon to..."
213,PADMÉ,213,"You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I
don't wish to hold you up. I'm
sure you have a great deal to do."
214,JAR JAR,214,"Of course, M'lady."
215,PADMÉ,215,I do not like this idea of hiding.
216,ANAKIN,216,"Don't worry. Now that the Council
has ordered an investigation, it
won't take Master Obi-Wan long to
find that bounty hunter."
217,"PADMÉ
(frustrated)",217,"I haven't worked for a year to
defeat the ""Military Creation Act""
not to be here when its fate is
decided."
218,ANAKIN,218,"Sometimes we have to let go of our
pride and do what is requested of
us."
219,PADMÉ,219,"Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and
you don't have a very firm grip on
politics. I suggest you reserve
your opinions for some other time."
220,ANAKIN,220,"Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying
to..."
221,PADMÉ,221,Annie! No!
222,ANAKIN,222,Please don't call me that.
223,PADMÉ,223,What?
224,ANAKIN,224,Annie...
225,PADMÉ,225,"I've always called you that... it
is your name, isn't it?"
226,ANAKIN,226,"It's Anakin. When you say Annie
it's like I'm still a little
boy... and I'm not."
227,PADMÉ,227,"I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible
to deny you've..."
228,(looks him over),228,...that you've grown up.
229,ANAKIN,229,"Master Obi-Wan manages not to see
it..."
230,PADMÉ,230,"Mentors have a way of seeing more
of our faults than we would like.
It's the only way we grow."
231,ANAKIN,231,"Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is
a great mentor. As wise as Master
Yoda and as powerful as Master
Windu. I am truly thankful to be
his apprentice. Only... although
I'm a Padawan learner, in some
ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead
of him. I'm ready for the trials.
I know I am! He knows it too. He
believes I'm too unpredictable...
Other Jedi my age have gone
through the trials and made it...
I know I started my training
late... but he won't let me move
on."
232,PADMÉ,232,That must be frustrating.
233,ANAKIN,233,"It's worse... he's overly
critical. He never listens! He
just doesn't understand! It's not
fair!"
234,PADMÉ,234,"I'm sorry... You sounded exactly
like that little boy I once knew,
when he didn't get his way."
235,ANAKIN,235,I'm not whining! I'm not.
236,PADMÉ,236,I didn't say it to hurt you.
237,ANAKIN,237,I know...
238,PADME,238,Anakin...
239,"PADMÉ
(continuing)",239,Don't try to grow up too fast.
240,ANAKIN,240,"I am grown up. You said it
yourself."
241,PADMÉ,241,Please don't look at me like that.
242,ANAKIN,242,Why not?
243,PADMÉ,243,"Because I can see what you're
thinking."
244,"ANAKIN
(laughing)",244,"Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers
too?"
245,PADMÉ,245,It makes me feel uncomfortable.
246,ANAKIN,246,"Sorry, M'lady."
247,CAPTAIN TYPHO,247,"Be safe, m'lady."
248,PADMÉ,248,"Thank you, Captain. Take good
care of Dorme... the threat's on
you two now."
249,DORME,249,He'll be safe with me.
250,PADMÉ,250,You'll be fine.
251,DORME,251,"It's not me, M'Lady. I worry
about you. What if they realise
I'm not you?"
252,"PADMÉ
(looks to Anakin)",252,"Then my Jedi protector will have
to prove how grown up he is."
253,OBI-WAN,253,"Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.
Do not attract any attention. Do
absolutely nothing without
checking in with me or the Council."
254,ANAKIN,254,"Yes, Master."
255,"OBI-WAN
(to Padme)",255,"I will get to the bottom of this
plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be
back here in no time."
256,PADMÉ,256,"I will be most grateful for your
speed, Master Jedi."
257,ANAKIN,257,Time to go.
258,PADMÉ,258,I know.
259,OBI-WAN,259,May the Force be with you.
260,ANAKIN,260,"May the Force be with you, Master."
261,PADMÉ,261,"Suddenly, I'm afraid..."
262,ANAKIN,262,"I'm kinda scared too. This is my
first assignment on my own."
263,PADMÉ,263,"There's nothing to worry about...
we have Artoo with us."
264,OBI-WAN,264,"I hope he doesn't try anything
foolish."
265,CAPTAIN TYPHO,265,"I'd be more concerned about her
doing something, than him."
266,PK-4,266,"Place the subject for analysis on
the sensot tray, please."
267,OBI-WAN,267,"It's a toxic dart. I need to know
where it came from and who made it."
268,PK-4,268,"One moment, please."
269,"PK-4
(continuing)",269,"As you can see on your screen,
subject weapon does not exist in
any known culture. Markings
cannot be identified. Probablt
self-made by a warrior not
associated with any known society."
270,OBI-WAN,270,"Excuse me? Could you try again
please?"
271,PK-4,271,"Master Jedi, our records are very
thorough. they cover eight
percent of the galaxy. If I can't
tell you where it came from,
nobody can."
272,OBI-WAN,272,"Thanks for your assistance! You
may not be able to figure this
out, but I think I know someone
who might."
273,SERVER,273,Keep moving! Keep moving!
274,"FOOD SERVER
(continuing)",274,Hey! No Droids!
275,ANAKIN,275,"No, no, Mom, no..."
276,"ANAKIN
(continuing)",276,What?
277,PADMÉ,277,"You seemed to be having a
nightmare."
278,"PADMÉ
(continuing)",278,Are you hungry?
279,ANAKIN,279,Thank you.
280,PADMÉ,280,"We went into lightspeed a while
ago."
281,ANAKIN,281,"I look forward to seeing Naboo
again. I've thought about it every
day since I left. It's by far the
most beautiful place I've ever
seen..."
282,PADMÉ,282,"You were just a little boy then.
It may not be as you remember it;
time changes your perception."
283,ANAKIN,283,"I think time has given me much
more mature feelings to enhance my
perception."
284,PADMÉ,284,"It must be difficult having sworn
your life to the Jedi... not being
able to visit the places you
like... or do the things you
like..."
285,ANAKIN,285,Or be with the people I love.
286,PADMÉ,286,"Are you allowed to love? I
thought that was forbidden for a
Jedi."
287,ANAKIN,287,"Attachment is forbidden.
Possession is forbidden.
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love, is central
to a Jedi's life, so you might say
we're encouraged to love."
288,PADMÉ,288,You have changed so much
289,ANAKIN,289,"You haven't changed a bit. You're
exactly the way I remember you in
my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has
changed much either."
290,PADMÉ,290,It hasn't...
291,ANAKIN,291,"I can't wait to breathe the sweet
breeze that comes off the rolling
hills. Whenever I try to
visualise the Force, those hills
are what I see."
292,"ANAKIN
(continuing)",292,I love Naboo.
293,"PADMÉ
(changing the subject)",293,"Were you dreaming about you
mother earlier, weren't you?"
294,ANAKIN,294,"Yes... I left Tatooine so long
ago, my memory of her is fading.
I don't want to lose it. Recently
I've been seeing her in my
dreams... vivid dreams... scary
dreams. I worry about her."
295,HERMIONE,295,Can I help ya?
296,OBI-WAN,296,I'm looking for Dexter.
297,HERMIONE BAGWA,297,Waddya want him for?
298,OBI-WAN,298,"He's not in trouble. It's
personal."
299,HERMIONE BAGWA,299,"Someone to see ya, honey"
300,(lowering her voice),300,"A Jedi, by the looks of him."
301,DEXTER JETTSTER,301,Obi-Wan!
302,OBI-WAN,302,"Hey, Dex."
303,DEXTER JETTSTER,303,Take a seat! Be right with ya!
304,HERMIONE BAGWA,304,You want a cup of ardees?
305,OBI-WAN,305,Thank you.
306,DEXTER JETTSTER,306,"Hey, ol' buddy!"
307,OBI-WAN,307,"Hey, Dex."
308,DEXTER JETTSTER,308,"So, my friend. What can I do for
ya?"
309,OBI-WAN,309,You can tell me what this is.
310,DEXTER JETTSTER,310,"Well, whattaya know..."
311,"DEXTER JETTSTER
(continuing)",311,"I ain't seen one of these since I
was prospecting on Subterrel
beyond the Outer Rim!"
312,OBI-WAN,312,Do you know where it came from?
313,DEXTER JETTSTER,313,"This baby belongs to them cloners.
What you got here is a Kamino
Kyberdart."
314,OBI-WAN,314,"Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why
it didn't show up in any analysis
archive."
315,DEXTER JETTSTER,315,"It's these funny little cuts on
the side give it away...
Those analysis droids you've got
over there only focus on symbols,
you know. I should think you Jedi
would have more respect for the
difference between knowledge and
wisdom."
316,OBI-WAN,316,"Well, Dex, if droids could think, we
wouldn't be here, would we?"
317,(laughing),317,"Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.
Is it part of the Republic?"
318,DEXTER JETTSTER,318,"No, it's beyond the Outer Rim.
I'd say about twelve parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze, toward the
south. It should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your
archive to find. Those Kaminoans
keep to themselves. They're
cloners. Damned good ones, too."
319,OBI-WAN,319,Cloners? Are they friendly?
320,DEXTER JETTSTER,320,It depends.
321,OBI-WAN,321,"On what, Dex?"
322,DEXTER JETTSTER,322,"On how good your manners are...
and how big your pocketbook is..."
323,ANAKIN,323,"If I grew up here, I don't think
I'd ever leave."
324,"PADMÉ
(laughing)",324,I doubt that.
325,ANAKIN,325,"No, really. When I started my
training, I was very homesick and
very lonely. This city and my Mom
were the only pleasant things I
had to think about... The problem
was, the more I thought about my
Mom, the worse I felt. But I
would feel better if I thought
about the palace - the way it
shimmers in the sunlight - the way
the air always smells of flowers..."
326,PADMÉ,326,"...and the soft sound of the
distant waterfalls. The first
time I saw the Capital, I was very
young... I'd never seen a
waterfall before. I though they
were so beautiful... I never
dreamed one day I'd live in the
palace."
327,ANAKIN,327,"Well, tell me, did you dream of
power and politics when you were
a little girl?"
328,"PADMÉ
(laughing)",328,"No! That was the last thing I
thought of. My dream was to help
in the ""Refugee Relief Movement.""
I never thought of running for
elected office. But the more
history I studied, the more I
realised how much good politicians
could do. So when I was eight, I
joined the ""Apprentice
Legislators"", then later on became
a Senatorial advisor, with such a
passion that, before I knew it, I
was elected Queen. Partly because
I scored so high on my education
certificate, but for the most part
it was my conviction that reform
was possible. I wasn't the
youngest Queen ever elected, but
now that I think back on it, I'm
not sure I was old enough. I'm not
sure I was ready."
329,ANAKIN,329,"The people you served thought you
did a good job. I heard they
tried to amend the Constitution so
you could stay in office."
330,PADMÉ,330,"Popular rule is not democracy,
Annie. It gives the people what
they want, not what they need.
And, truthfully, I was relieved
when my two terms were up. So
were my parents. They worried
About me during the blockade and
couldn't wait for it all to be
over. Actually, I was hoping to
have a family by now... My
sisters have the most amazing,
wonderful kids... but when the
Queen asked me to serve as
Senator, I couldn't refuse her."
331,ANAKIN,331,"I agree! I think the Republic
needs you... I'm glad you chose
to serve. I feel things are going
to happen in our generation that
will change the galaxy in profound
ways."
332,PADMÉ,332,I think so too.
333,QUEEN JAMILLIA,333,We've been worried about you.
334,(takes her hand),334,"I'm so glad you're safe, Padmé."
335,PADMÉ,335,"Thank you, Your Highness. I only
Wish I could have served you
better by staying on Coruscant for
the vote."
336,SIO BIBBLE,336,"Given the circumstances, Senator,
you know it was the only decision
Her Highness could have made."
337,QUEEN JAMILLIA,337,"How many systems have joined Count
Dooku and the separatists?"
338,PADMÉ,338,"About two hundred. And more are
leaving the Republic every day.
If the Senate votes to create an
army, I'm sure it's going to push
us into a civil war."
339,SIO BIBBLE,339,"It's unthinkable! There hasn't
been a full-scale war since the
formation of the Republic!"
340,QUEEN JAMILLIA,340,"Do you see any way, through
negotiations, to bring the
separatists back into the Republic?"
341,PADMÉ,341,"Not if they feel threatened. The
separatists don't have an army,
but if they are provoked, they
will move to defend themselves.
I'm sure of that. And with no time
or money to build an army, my
guess is they will turn to the
Commerce Guilds or the Trade
Federation for help."
342,QUEEN JAMILLIA,342,"The armies of commerce! Why has
Nothing been done in the Senate
to restrain them?"
343,PADMÉ,343,"I'm afraid that, despite the
Chancellor's best efforts, there
are still many bureaucrats,
judges, and even Senators on the
payrolls of the Guilds."
344,SIO BIBBLE,344,"It's outrageous! After all of
those hearings, and the four trials in
the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
still the Viceroy of the Trade
Federation. Do those money
mongers control everything?"
345,QUEEN JAMILLIA,345,"Remember, Counsellor, the courts
were able to reduce the
Federation's armies. That's a
move in the right
direction."
346,PADMÉ,346,"There are rumours, Your Highness,
that the Federation Army was not
reduced as they were ordered."
347,ANAKIN,347,"The Jedi have not been allowed to
investigate. It would be to be too
dangerous for the economy, we were
told."
348,QUEEN JAMILLIA,348,"We must keep our faith in the
Republic. The day we stop
believing democracy can work is
the day we lose it."
349,PADMÉ,349,Let's pray that day never comes.
350,QUEEN JAMILLIA,350,"In the meantime, we must consider
your own safety."
351,"SIO BIBBLE
(to Anakin)",351,"What is your suggestion, Master
Jedi?"
352,PADMÉ,352,"Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.
He's still a Padawan learner. I
was thinking..."
353,"ANAKIN
(nettled)",353,"Hey, hold on a minute!"
354,PADMÉ,354,"Excuse me! I was thinking I would
stay in the Lake Country. There
are some places up there that are
very isolated."
355,ANAKIN,355,"Excuse me?! I am in charge of
security here, M'Lady."
356,PADMÉ,356,"Annie, my life is at risk, and
this is my home. I know it very
well... that is why we're here.
I think it would be wise for you
to take advantage of my knowledge
in this instance."
357,"ANAKIN
(takes a deep breath)",357,"Sorry, M'Lady."
358,"SIO BIBBLE
(to Anakin, amused)",358,"She is right. The Lake Country is
the most remote part of Naboo.
Not many people and a clear view
of the surrounding terrain."
359,QUEEN JAMILLIA,359,Perfect. It's settled then.
360,"QUEEN JAMILLIA
(continued)",360,"Padmé, I had an audience with your
father yesterday. I told him what
was happening. He hopes you will
visit your mother before you
leave... your family's very
worried about you."
361,JOCASTA NU,361,Did you call for assistance?
362,"OBI-WAN
(distracted in thought)",362,"Yes... yes, I did..."
363,JOCASTA NU,363,"He has a powerful face, doesn't
he? He was one of the most
brilliant Jedi I have had the
privilege of knowing."
364,OBI-WAN,364,"I never understood why he quit.
Only twenty Jedi have ever left
the Order."
365,"JOCASTA NU
(sighs)",365,"The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku
was the most recent and the most
painful. No one likes to talk
about it. His leaving was a great
loss to the Order."
366,OBI-WAN,366,What happened?
367,JOCASTA NU,367,"Well, one might say, he was always
a bit out of step with the
decisions of the Council... much
like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn."
368,"OBI-WAN
(surprised)",368,Really?
369,JOCASTA NU,369,"Oh, yes. They were alike in many
ways. Very individual thinkers...
idealists..."
370,"JOCASTA NU
(continuing",370,"He was always striving to become
a more powerful Jedi. He wanted
to be the best. With a lightsaber,
in the old style of fencing, he
had no match. His knowledge of
the Force was... unique. In the
end, I think he left because he
lost faith in the Republic. He
believed that politics were
corrupt, and he felt the Jedi
betrayed themselves by serving the
politicians. He always had very
high expectations of government.
He disappeared for nine or ten
years, then he just showed up
recently as the head of the
separatist movement."
371,OBI-WAN,371,"Interesting... I'm still not sure
I understand."
372,JOCASTA NU,372,"Well, I'm sure you didn't call me
over here for a history lesson.
Are you having a problem, Master
Kenobi?"
373,OBI-WAN,373,"Yes, I'm trying to find a planet
system called Kamino. It doesn't
seem to show upon any of the
archive charts."
374,JOCASTA NU,374,"Kamino? It's not a system I'M
familiar with... Let me see..."
375,"JOCASTA NU
(continuing)",375,"Are you sure you have the right
co-ordinates?"
376,"OBI-WAN
(nodding)",376,"According to my information, it
should be in this quadrant
somewhere... just south of the
Rishi Maze."
377,JOCASTA NU,377,"No co-ordinates? It sounds like the
kind of directions you'd get from
a street tout... some old miner or
Furbog trader."
378,OBI-WAN,378,All three actually.
379,JOCASTA NU,379,Are you sure it exists?
380,OBI-WAN,380,Absolutely.
381,JOCASTA NU,381,Let me do a gravitational scan.
382,JOCASTA NU,382,"There are some inconsistencies
here. Maybe the planet you're
looking for was destroyed."
383,OBI-WAN,383,Wouldn't that be on record?
384,JOCASTA NU,384,"It ought to be. Unless it was very
recent."
385,(shakes her head),385,"I hate to say it, but it looks
like the system you're searching
for doesn't exist."
386,OBI-WAN,386,"That's impossible... perhaps the
archives are incomplete."
387,JOCASTA NU,387,"The archives are comprehensive and
totally secure, my young Jedi.
One thing you may be absolutely
sure of - if an item does not
appear in our records, it does not
exist!"
388,PADME,388,There's my house!
389,"PADME
(continuing)",389,What? Don't say you're shy!
390,"ANAKIN
(untruthfully)",390,"No, but I..."
391,RYOO & POOJA,391,Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!
392,PADME,392,Ryoo!! Pooja!!
393,"PADME
(continuing)",393,"I'm so happy to see you! This is
Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and
this is Pooja."
394,RYOO & POOJA,394,Artoo!!!
395,"SOLA
(over her shoulder)",395,"They're eating over at Jev
Narran's later, Mom. They just
had a snack. They'll be fine."
396,PADME,396,"Anakin, this is my sister, Sola."
397,SOLA,397,"Hello, Anakin."
398,ANAKIN,398,Hello.
399,JOBAL,399,"You're just in time for dinner. I
hope you're hungry, Anakin."
400,ANAKIN,400,A little.
401,PADME,401,"He's being polite, Mom. We're
starving."
402,"RUWEE
(grinning)",402,"You came to the right place at the
right time. Sit down, son."
403,"JOBAL
(to Padme)",403,"Honey, it's so good to see you
safe. We were so worried."
404,RUWEE,404,Dear...
405,JOBAL,405,"I know, I know... but I had to say
it. Now it's done."
406,SOLA,406,"Well, this is exciting! Do you
know, Anakin, you're the first
boyfriend my sister's ever brought
home?"
407,"PADME
(rolls her eyes)",407,"Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend!
He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate
to protect me."
408,JOVAL,408,"A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They
didn't tell us it was that serious!"
409,PADME,409,"It's not, Mom, I promise."
410,(glances at Jobal),410,"Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've
known him for years. Remember
that little boy who was with the
Jedi during the blockade crisis?"
411,"PADME
(continuing)",411,He grew up.
412,JOBAL,412,"Honey, when are you going to
settle down? Haven't you had
enough of that life? I certainly
have!"
413,PADME,413,"Mom, I'm not in any danger."
414,"RUWEE
(to Anakin)",414,Is she?
415,ANAKIN,415,...Yes... I'm afraid she is.
416,"PADME
(quickly)",416,But not much.
417,RUWEE,417,"Sometimes I wish I'd traveled
more... but I must say, I'm happy
here."
418,ANAKIN,418,"Padme tells me you teach at the
university?"
419,"RUWEE
(nodding)",419,"Yes, and before that, I was a
builder. I also worked for the
Refugee Relief Movement, when I
was very young."
420,SOLA,420,Why haven't you told us about him?
421,PADMÉ,421,"What's there to talk about?  He's
just a boy."
422,SOLA,422,"A boy? Have you seen the way he
looks at you?"
423,PADMÉ,423,Sola - stop it!
424,SOLA,424,"It's obvious he has feelings for
you. Are you saying, little baby
sister, that you haven't noticed?"
425,PADMÉ,425,"I'm not your baby sister, Sola.
Anakin and I are friends... our
relationship is strictly
professional."
426,(to Jobal),426,"Mom, would you tell her to stop it?"
427,"SOLA
(laughing)",427,"Well, maybe you haven't noticed
the way he looks at you. I think
you're afraid to."
428,PADMÉ,428,Cut it out.
429,JOBAL,429,"Sola's just concerned... we all
are."
430,PADMÉ,430,"Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What
I'm doing is important."
431,JOBAL,431,"You've done your service, Padmé.
It's time you had a life of your
own. You're missing so much!"
432,RUWEE,432,"Now tell me, son. How serious is
this thing? How much danger is my
daughter really in?"
433,ANAKIN,433,"There have been two attempts on
her life. Chances are there'll be
more. My Master is tracking down
the assassins. I'm sure he'll find
out who they are. This situation,
won't last long."
434,RUWEE,434,"I don't want anything to happen to
her."
435,ANAKIN,435,I don't either.
436,PADME,436,"Don't worry, this won't take long."
437,ANAKIN,437,"I just want to get there before
dark."
438,"ANAKIN
(continuing)",438,You still live at home.
439,PADME,439,"I move around so much, I've never
had a place of my own. Official
residences have no warmth. I feel
good here. I feel at home."
440,ANAKIN,440,"I never had a real home. Home was
always where my Mom was."
441,"ANAKIN
(continuing)",441,Is this you?
442,PADME,442,"That was when I went with the
Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.
Their sun was imploding, and the
planet was dying. I was helping
to relocate the children. See
that little one I'm holding? His
name was N'a-kee-tula, which means
sweethear. He was so full of
life,. All those kids were. I did
everything I could to save him,
but he died... they all did. They
were never able to adapt... to
live off their native planet."
443,"PADME
(continuing)",443,"My first day as an Apprentice
Legislator. Notice the difference?"
444,YODA,444,"Don't think... feel... be as one
with the Force. Help you, it will."
445,(he sees Obi-Wan),445,"Younglings - enough! A visitor we
have. Welcome him."
446,"YODA
(continuing)",446,"Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the
mighty Bear Clan."
447,CHILDREN,447,"Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!"
448,OBI-WAN,448,"I am sorry to disturb you, Master."
449,YODA,449,"What help to you, can I be?"
450,OBI-WAN,450,"Im looking for a planet described
to me by an old friend. I trust
him. But the system doesnt show
up on the archive maps."
451,YODA,451,"An interesting puzzle. Gather
round the map reader, younglings.
Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
Find it, we will try..."
452,OBI-WAN,452,"This is where it ought to be...
but it isnt. Gravity is pulling
all the stars in this area inward
to this spot. There should be a
star here... but there isnt."
453,YODA,453,"Most interesting. Gravitys
silhouette remains, but the star
and all its planets have
disappeared. How can this be?"
454,JEDI CHILD JACK,454,"Because someone erased it from the
archive memory."
455,CHILDREN,455,"Thats right! Yes! Thats what
happened! Someone erased it!"
456,JEDI CHILD MAY,456,"If the planet blew up, the gravity
would go away."
457,YODA,457,"Truly wonderful, the mind of a
child is. Uncluttered. To the
centre of the pull of gravity go,
and find your planet you will."
458,OBI-WAN,458,"But Master Yoda who could have
erased information from the
archives? Thats impossible,
isnt it?"
459,"YODA
(frowning)",459,"Much harder to answer, that
question is."
460,PADMÉ,460,"When I was in Level Three, we used
to come here for school retreat.
See that island? We used to swim
there every day. I love the water."
461,ANAKIN,461,"I do too. I guess it comes from
growing up on a desert planet."
462,PADMÉ,462,"...We used to lie on the sand and
let the sun dry us... and try to
guess the names of the birds
singing."
463,ANAKIN,463,"I dont like sand. Its coarse
and rough and irritating, and it
gets everywhere. Not like here.
Here everythings soft... and
smooth..."
464,PADMÉ,464,"There was a very old man who lived
on the island. He used to make
glass out of sand - and vases and
necklaces out of the glass. They
were magical."
465,"ANAKIN
(looks into her eyes)",465,Everything here is magical.
466,PADMÉ,466,"You could look into the glass and
see the water. The way it ripples
and moves. It looked so real...
but it wasnt."
467,ANAKIN,467,"Sometimes, when you believe
something to be real, it becomes
real. Real enough, anyway..."
468,PADMÉ,468,"I used to think if you looked too
deeply into glass, you would
lose yourself."
469,ANAKIN,469,I think it's true...
470,PADMÉ,470,I shouldn't have done that.
471,ANAKIN,471,"I'm sorry. When I'm around you,
my mind is no longer my own."
472,PADMÉ,472,It's the situation... the stress...
473,ANAKIN,473,...the view.
474,MACE WINDU,474,"Be wary, this disturbance in the
Force is growing stronger."
475,OBI-WAN,475,"I am concerned for my Padawan. He
is not ready to be on his own."
476,YODA,476,"The Council is confident in this decision,
Obi-Wan."
477,MACE,477,"He has exceptional skills. The
Council is confident in its
decision, Obi-Wan. If the
prophecy is true, he weill be the
one to bring balance to the Force."
478,OBI-WAN,478,"But he still has much to learn.
And his abilities have made him...
well... arrogant. I realise now
what you and Master Yoda knew from
the beginning... the boy was too
old to start the training and..."
479,MACE WINDU,479,There's something else?
480,OBI-WAN,480,"Master, he should not have been
given this assignment. I'm afraid
Anakin won't be able to protect
the Senator."
481,MACE WINDU,481,Why?
482,OBI-WAN,482,"He has a... an emotional
connection with her. It's been
there since he was boy. Now
he's confused... distracted."
483,MACE-WINDU,483,"Obi-Wan, you must have faith that
he will take the right path."
484,OBI-WAN,484,"Has Master Yoda gained any insight
into whether or not this war will
come about?"
485,MACE WINDU,485,"Probing the Dark Side is a
dangerous process. He could be in
seclusion for days... May the
force be with you."
486,PADME,486,You did that?
487,ANAKIN,487,What?
488,PADME,488,That! Now stop it!
489,"PADME
(continuing)",489,Anakin!!
490,ANAKIN,490,"I'm not really supposed to do
that... for fun, I mean. If
Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be
very grumpy."
491,ANAKIN,491,May I tell you something?
492,PADME,492,I don't know.
493,ANAKIN,493,Then how can I tell you?
494,PADME,494,"Maybe you should use your Jedi
intuition."
495,ANAKIN,495,"It doesn't work around you. My
mind is always a muddle... I can
only think of you."
496,PADME,496,"Anakin, don't..."
497,ANAKIN,497,"From the moment I met you, all
those years ago, a day hasn't gone
by when I haven't thought of you.
And now that I'm close to you again,
I'm in agony. The closer I get to
you, the worse it gets. The
thought of not being with you
mskes my stomach turn over - my
mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I
can't breathe. I'm haunted by the
kiss you should never have given
me. My heart is beating, hoping
that kiss will not become a scar.
You are in my very soul,
tormenting me. What can I do? I
will do anything you ask..."
498,"ANAKIN
(continuing)",498,"If you are suffering as much as I
am, tell me."
499,PADME,499,"...I can't. We can't. It's just
not possible."
500,ANAKIN,500,"Anything's possible. Padme,
please listen..."
501,PADME,501,"You listen. We live in a real
world. Come back to it. You're
studying to become a Jedi Knight.
I'm a Senator. If you follow your
thoughts through to conclusion,
they will take us to a place we
cannot go... regardless of the way
we feel about each other."
502,ANAKIN,502,"Then you do feel something!
There's an extraordinary
connection between us. You can't
deny that."
503,PADME,503,"Annie, it doesn't make any
difference. Jedi aren't allowed
to marry. You swore an oath,
remember? You'd be expelled from
the Order. I will not let you
give up your responsibilities...
your future, for me."
504,ANAKIN,504,"I was destined to be a Jedi. I
don't think I could be anything
else. But you are asking me to be
rational. That is something I
know I cannot do. I wish I could
wish my feelings away... but I
can't."
505,PADME,505,"I am not going to give into this.
I'm not going to throw my life
away. I have more important things
to do than fall in love."
506,ANAKIN,506,"It wouldn't have to be that way...
we could keep it a secret."
507,PADME,507,"Then we'd be living a lie - one we
couldn't keep even if we wanted
to. Mt sister saw it. So did my
mother. I couldn't do that.
Could you, Anakin? Could you live
like that?"
508,ANAKIN,508,"...No, you're right. It would
destroy us."
509,TAUN WE,509,"Welcome to Tipoca City, Master
Jedi."
510,TAUN WE,510,"Everything is ready. The Prime
Minister expects you."
511,"OBI-WAN
(warily)",511,I'm expected?
512,TAUN WE,512,"Of course! He is anxious to see
you. After all these years, we
were beginning to think you
weren't coming. Now please, this
way!"
513,TAUN WE,513,"May I present Lama Su, Prime
Minister of Kamino... and this is
Master Jedi..."
514,OBI-WAN,514,Obi-Wan Kenobi.
515,LAMA SU,515,Please...
516,LAMA SU,516,"I trust you are going to enjoy
your stay. We are most happy you
have arrived at the best part of
the season."
517,OBI-WAN,517,You make me feel most welcome.
518,LAMA SU,518,"And now to business. You will be
delighted to hear we are on
schedule. Two hundred thousand
units are ready, with another
million well on the way."
519,"OBI-WAN
(improvising)",519,That is... good news.
520,LAMA SU,520,"Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas
that we have every confidence his
order will be met on time and in
full. He is well, I hope?"
521,OBI-WAN,521,I'm sorry Master - ?
522,LAMA SU,522,"Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still
a leading member of the Jedi
Council, is he not?"
523,OBI-WAN,523,"Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas."
524,"LAMA SU
(rising)",524,"You must be anxious to inspect the
units for yourself."
525,OBI-WAN,525,That's why I'm here.
526,PADMÉ,526,I don't know...
527,ANAKIN,527,"Sure you do... you just don't want
to tell me."
528,PADMÉ,528,"Are you going to use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?"
529,ANAKIN,529,"They only work on the weak-minded.
You are anything but weak-minded."
530,PADMÉ,530,"All right... his name was Palo.
I was twelve. We were both in the
Legislative Youth Program. He was
a few years older then I... very
cute... dark curly hair... dreamy
eyes."
531,ANAKIN,531,"All right, I get the picture...
whatever happened to him?"
532,PADMÉ,532,"I went on to become a Queen. He
went on to become an artist."
533,ANAKIN,533,Maybe he was the smart one.
534,PADME,534,"You really don't like politicians,
do you?"
535,ANAKIN,535,"I like two or three, but I'm not
really sure about one of them."
536,(smiling),536,I don't think the system works.
537,PADME,537,How would you have it work?
538,ANAKIN,538,"We need a system where the
politicians sit down and discuss
the problems, agree what's in the
best interests of all the people,
and then do it."
539,PADME,539,"That is exactly what we do. The
trouble is that people don't
wlways agree. In fact, they
hardly ever do."
540,ANAKIN,540,Then they should be made to.
541,PADME,541,By whom? Who's going to make them?
542,ANAKIN,542,I don't know. Someone.
543,PADME,543,You?
544,ANAKIN,544,Of course not me.
545,PADME,545,But someone.
546,ANAKIN,546,Someone wise.
547,PADME,547,"That sounds an awful lot like a
dictatorship to me."
548,ANAKIN,548,"Well, if it works..."
549,PADMÉ,549,You're making fun of me.
550,ANAKIN,550,"On no, I'd be much too frightened
to tease a Senator."
551,PADMÉ,551,You're so bad!
552,ANAKIN,552,"You're always so serious. Always
carrying the weight of the
universe on your shoulders."
553,"LAMA SU
(beaming)",553,"Magnificent, aren't they?"
554,LAMA SU,554,"We modified their genetic
structure to make them less
independent than the original
host. As a result they are
totally obedient, taking any order
without question."
555,OBI-WAM,555,Who was the original host?
556,LAMA SU,556,"A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
We felt a Jedi would be the
perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-
picked Jango Fett himself."
557,OBI-WAN,557,Where is this bounty hunter now?
558,LAMA SU,558,"Oh, we keep him here. After a few
hundred thousand clones, the
genetic pattern starts to fade, so
we take a fresh supply. He lives
here, but he's free to come and go
as he pleases."
559,LAMA SU,559,"Apart from his pay, which is
considerable, Fett demanded only
one thing - an unaltered clone for
himself. Curious isn't it?"
560,OBI-WAN,560,Unaltered?
561,LAMA SU,561,"Pure genetic replication. No
tampering with the structure to
make it more docile... and no
growth acceleration..."
562,OBI-WAN,562,"I would like to meet this Jango
Fett."
563,TAUN WE,563,"I would be most happy to arrange
it, for you."
564,OBI-WAN,564,"You mentioned growth
acceleration..."
565,LAMA SU,565,"Oh yes, it's essential.
Otherwise, a mature clone would
take a lifetime to grow. Now, we
can do it in half the time. Those
items you saw on the parade ground
were started ten years ago, when
Sido-dyas first placed the order,
and they're already mature..."
566,OBI-WAN,566,And these?
567,LAMA SU,567,About five years ago.
568,LAMA SU,568,"They're immensely superior to
droids, capable of independent
thought and action."
569,OBI-WAN,569,Very impressive.
570,LAMA SU,570,I'd hoped you would be pleased.
571,"OBI-WAN
(carefully)",571,"Tell me, prime minister, when my
Master Sido-dyas first contacted
you, did he say the order was
for... himself... or?"
572,LAMA SU,572,"Himself? Of course not. This
army is for the Republic?"
573,"OBI-WAN
(astonished)",573,The Repubic?
574,LAMA SU,574,"We are also very much agasint this
Count Dooku and his seccessionist
movement. We are proud to be of
help to the Republic."
575,TAUN WE,575,"I have arranged for you to meet
Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep
well."
576,OBI-WAN,576,"Arfour, Arfour..."
577,OBI-WAN,577,"Arfour, relay this, ""scramble code
five,"" to Courscant: care of ""the
old folks home."""
578,OBI-WAN (V.O.),578,"...I've never heard of a Jedi
called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?"
579,MACE WINDU,579,"No. Whoever placed that order was
not a Jedi, I can assure you."
580,OBI-WAN (V.O.),580,"I have a strong feeling that this
bounty hunter is the assassin
we're looking for."
581,YODA,581,"Who he is working for... discover
that, you must."
582,OBI-WAN (V.O.),582,"I will, Master, and I will also
find out more about this clone
army... May The Force..."
583,WINDU,583,"A clone army! Ordered by someone
in the Senate perhaps... Someone's
out to start a war."
584,YODA,584,"Inform the chancellor of this, we
must."
585,WINDU,585,"Who do you think this impostor
Sido-Dyas, could be?"
586,ANAKIN,586,"No...No...No...Mom!...Don't,
no, don't!"
587,"ANAKIN
(eyes closed)",587,Don't go.
588,PAMDE,588,I don't want to disturb you.
589,ANAKIN,589,Your presence is soothing.
590,PADME,590,"You had a nightmare again last
night."
591,ANAKIN,591,Jedi don't have nightmares.
592,PADME,592,I heard you.
593,ANAKIN,593,"I saw my mother. I saw her as
clearly as I see you now. She's
suffering, Padme. She is in
pain...They're killing her!"
594,(getting up),594,"I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator. I know I
will be punished and possibly
thrown out of the Jedi Order, but
I must go. I have to help her!
I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a
choice."
595,PADME,595,"Annie, I told you I wouldn't let
you give up your future for me.
I'll go with you. That way you
can continue to protect me, and
you won't be disobeying your
mandate."
596,ANAKIN,596,What about Master Obi-wan?
597,PADME,597,"I guess we won't tell him, will we?"
598,TAUN WE,598,"Boba, is your father here?"
599,"TAUN WE
(continuing)",599,May we see him?
600,BOBA FETT,600,Sure.
601,BOBA FETT,601,Dad! Taun We's here!
602,TAUN WE,602,"Welcome back, Jango. Was your
trip productive?"
603,JANGO FETT,603,Fairly.
604,TAUN WE,604,"This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan
Kenobi. He's come to check on our
progress."
605,JANGO FETT,605,That right?
606,OBI-WAN,606,"Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud."
607,JANGO FETT,607,"I'm just a simple man, trying to
make my way in the universe,
Master Jedi."
608,OBI-WAN,608,Aren't we all?
609,"OBI-WAN
(continuing)",609,"Ever made your way as far into the
interior as Coruscant?"
610,JANGO,610,Once or twice.
611,OBI-WAN,611,Recently?
612,"JANGO
(eyes Obi-Wan carefully)",612,Possibly...
613,OBI-WAN,613,"Then you must know Master Sido-
Dyas?"
614,JANGO,614,"Boba, close the door."
615,"JANGO
(continuing)",615,Master who?
616,OBI-WAN,616,"Sido-Dyas. Isnt he the Jedi who
hired you for this job?"
617,JANGO,617,"Never heard of him. I was
recuited by a man called Darth
Tyranus on one of the moons of
Bogden."
618,OBI-WAN,618,No? I thought...
619,TAUN WE,619,"Sido-Dyas told us to expect him.
And he showed up just when your
Jedi Master said he would. We
have kept the Jedis involvement
a secret until your arrival, just
as your Master requested."
620,OBI-WAN,620,Curious...
621,JANGO,621,Do you like your army?
622,OBI-WAN,622,"It seems to me it's your army -
being that they are all clones of
you."
623,"JANGO
(grinning)",623,"They'll do their job well, I'll
guarantee that."
624,OBI-WAN,624,"I look forward to seeing them in
action. Thank you for your time,
Jango."
625,JANGO,625,Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
626,BOBA,626,"What is it, Dad?"
627,"ANAKIN
(to the droid driver)",627,"Wait, please."
628,"WATTO
(yelling, in Huttese)",628,"No, not that one - that one!"
629,"ANAKIN
(arriving)",629,"Excuse me, Watto."
630,"WATTO
(in Huttese)",630,What?
631,"ANAKIN
(in Huttese)",631,I said excuse me.
632,"WATTO
(in Huttese)",632,Shut down.
633,"WATTO
(continuing, in Huttese)",633,"What? I don't know you... What can
I do for you? You look like a
Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't
do it."
634,ANAKIN,634,Let me help you with that.
635,"ANAKIN
(continuing)",635,I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
636,WATTO,636,Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!
637,"WATTO
(continuing; in English)",637,"You are Annie! It is you! You
little womp rat."
638,"WATTO
(continuing)",638,"You sure sprouted Weehoo! A
Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe
you couldda help wit some
daedbeats who owe..."
639,ANAKIN,639,My mother...
640,WATTO,640,"Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine
no more. I sold her."
641,ANAKIN,641,Sold her...
642,WATTO,642,"Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you
know, business is business.
Sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars. Least I think it was
Lars. Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her. Can
ya beat that?"
643,ANAKIN,643,Do you know where they are?
644,WATTO,644,"Long way from here... someplace
over on the other side of Mos
Eisley, I think..."
645,ANAKIN,645,I'd like to know.
646,WATTO,646,"Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's
go look in my records."
647,LAMA SU,647,"Tell your Council the first
battalions are ready. And remind
them that if they need more
troops, we will need time to grow
them."
648,OBI-WAN,648,I won't forget.
649,BOBA FETT,649,Dad!!
650,PADME,650,"Stay with the ship, Artoo."
651,C-3PO,651,Good evening. May I help you?
652,ANAKIN,652,Threepio?
653,C-3PO,653,"Oh, my... oh, my! Master
Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly
believe it! And this must be Miss
Padme."
654,PADME,654,"Hello, Threepio."
655,ANAKIN,655,I've come to see my mother.
656,C-3PO,656,"Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry,
Master Annie."
657,PADME,657,"Threepio, what's happened?"
658,C-3PO,658,I think we'd better go inside.
659,C-3PO,659,"Master Lars - Master Owen!
Somebody to see you!"
660,ANAKIN,660,"I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here
looking for my mother."
661,OWEN,661,"Owen Lars... I guess I'm your
step-brother."
662,(they shake hands),662,"This is my girlfriend, Beru."
663,BERU,663,Hello.
664,PADME,664,I'm Padme.
665,OWEN,665,"I had a feeling you might show up
some day."
666,ANAKIN,666,Is my mother here?
667,CLIEGG,667,"No, she's not."
668,"CLIEGG
(continuing)",668,"Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife...
Come on inside. We have a lot to
talk about."
669,CLIEGG (O.S.),669,"It was just before dawn. They
came out of nowhere. A hunting
party of Tusekn Raiders."
670,CLIEGG,670,"Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did, to pick
mushrooms that grow on the
vaporatos. From the tracks, she
was about halfway when they
took her. Those Tuskens walk like
men, but they're vicious, mindless
monsters. Thirty of us went out
after her. Four of us came back.
Three more are still out there
looking. I'd be with them,
only... I just couldn't ride any
more... until I heal."
671,"CLIEGG
(continuing)",671,"This isn't the way I wanted to
meet you, son. This isn't how
your mother and I planned it. I
don't want to give up on her, but
she's been gone a month. There's
little hope she's lasted this long."
672,OWEN,672,Where are you going?
673,ANAKIN,673,To find my mother.
674,PADME,674,"No, Annie!"
675,CLIEGG,675,"She's daed, son. Accept it."
676,ANAKIN,676,"I can feel her pain, and I will
find her. I know she's alive."
677,ANAKIN,677,"You are going to have to stay
here. These are good people,
Padme. You'll be safe."
678,OWEN,678,Take my speeder bike.
679,PADME,679,Anakin...
680,ANAKIN,680,"I trust you'll watch over her,
Owen."
681,OWEN,681,Don't worry.
682,ANAKIN,682,I won't be long.
683,JANGO FETT,683,"Nearly there, son."
684,BOBA FETT,684,"Dad, look!!"
685,JANGO FETT,685,Hang on!
686,BOBA FETT,686,Dad! Watch out!
687,JANGO FETT,687,"Stay calm, son. We'll be fine.
That Jedi won't be able to follow
us through this."
688,BOBA FETT,688,Got him! Yeahhhhh!
689,JANGO FETT,689,We won't see him again.
690,C-3PO,690,"Please don't leave us, Miss Padme.
These people need your help."
691,PADME,691,"I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just
can't sleep."
692,C-3PO,692,"That's something I cannot relate
to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm
either active or inactive.
There's no in-between."
693,PADME,693,I guess you're lucky.
694,C-3PO,694,"Do you really think so..? I
suppose I shouldn't expect..."
695,PADME,695,You're not happy here?
696,C-3PO,696,"Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my
masters here ar so kind I
wouldn't wish to trouuble them,
it's just... being like this...
well, it's embarrassing."
697,PADME,697,Being like what?
698,C-3PO,698,"Naked. If you pardon the
expression. You see, when Master
Annie made me, he never quite
found the time to give me any
outer covering. It's so
humiliating. How would you like it
if you had to go around with all
your circuits showing?"
699,PADME,699,I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
700,C-3PO,700,"Of course you wouldn't. Nobody
would. It's simply not protocol."
701,PADME,701,Maybe we can do something about it.
702,C-3PO,702,"I don't think so. Only Master
Annie..."
703,PADME,703,"Why not? They seem to have a box
of old coverings here."
704,C-3PO,704,"Oh? How observant of you, Miss
Padme. Of course, I'm just not
mechanically minded... if you see
what I mean."
705,PADME,705,"Let's see, if we put this...
here..."
706,C-3PO,706,Ooooh! That's tickles.
707,PADME,707,"You'll have to be quiet, Threepio.
Hold still, please."
708,ANAKIN,708,Mom... Mom... Mom...
709,SHMI,709,Annie...? Is it you?
710,ANAKIN,710,"Im here, Mom. Youre safe. Hang
on. Im going to get you out of
here..."
711,SHMI,711,"Im so glad... to see you,
Annie... Now... I am complete..."
712,ANAKIN,712,"Just stay with me, Mom. Im going
to make you well again.
Everythings going to be fine."
713,SHMI,713,"You look so handsome. My son...
my grown-up son. Im so proud of
you, Annie... so proud... I missed
you so much... I love..."
714,OBI-WAN,714,"""Guiding light"" to ""old folks
home."""
715,OBI-WAN,715,"...Starships from the Trade
Federation and the Commerce Guilds
are taking deliveries of battle
droids from the foundries on
Geonosis."
716,BAIL ORGANA,716,"That's outrageous! The treaty
forbids the Trade Federation from
building up an army. What are
they doing?!"
717,OBI-WAN,717,"The droid foundry seems to be
working at full capacity. I am
going to go down and investigate.
I will bring Jango Fett back home
for interrogation."
718,PALPATINE,718,"Those Geonosian foundries are part
of the Techno Union. We will call
in their representatives and ask
them a few very pointed questions."
719,OBI-WAN,719,"One more thing. Jango mentioned
he was recruited by someone named
Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that
might be?"
720,YODA,720,"With the forename Darth, a Sith he
must be."
721,MACE WINDU,721,"Our missing apprentice. They are
playing their hand at last."
722,OBI-WAN,722,"Do you believe he could be the
mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the
deal for the clone army?"
723,YODA,723,"Perhaps too many pieces are missing
from this puzzle, there are."
724,MACE WINDU,724,"Be careful, Obi-Wan. This
investigation is becoming less
than routine. Do you need help?"
725,OBI-WAN,725,"Let me see if I can figure out
what's going on first."
726,BAIL ORGANA,726,"The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war... there can be no doubt
of that."
727,PALPATINE,727,"Count Dooku must have made a
treaty with them."
728,MACE WINDU,728,"We must stop them soon before
they're fully ready."
729,SENATOR ASK AAK,729,"The debate is over, we need
that clone army now!"
730,BAIL ORGANA,730,"Unfortunately, the debate is not
over. The Senate will never be
able to approve the use of that
army before the separatists
attack."
731,MAS AMEDDA,731,"This is a crisis! If the Senate
votes the Chancellor emergency
powers, he could approve the use
of the army in a minute."
732,PALPATINE,732,"Please, please, I don't wish to
have emergency powers. That's too
extreme a solution. It's akin to
a dictatorship. We must rely on
the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many
are available to go to Geonosis?"
733,YODA,733,"Two Hundred,... less or more."
734,BAIL ORGANA,734,"With all due respect for the Jedi
Order, two hundred will be no
match for hundreds of thousands of
battle droids."
735,MACE WINDU,735,"Patience. We should wait for Obi-
Wan to report back. We don't know
that Count Dooku has made a treaty
with the Corporate Alliance, it's
speculation."
736,SENATOR ASK AAK,736,"But we must prepare for the worst.
I'm going to propose a motion
granting emergency powers to the
Chancellor at the next session. We
must not wait!"
737,PALPATINE,737,"Out of the question, Senator! You
and I are too closely aligned.
The issue will become partisan and
debates will begin. The proposal
must come from a neutral source."
738,MAS AMEDDA,738,If only Senator Amidala were here.
739,JAR JAR,739,"Supreme Chancellor... my august
colleagues, I would be proud to
propose the motion in question.
This is a grave situation, and I'm
sure Senator Amidala, and the
Queen of Naboo would agree."
740,SENATOR ASK AAK,740,"Thank you, Representative Binks."
741,PALPATINE,741,"If called upon, I will serve. But
it will be the saddest day of my
life."
742,PADME,742,There!
743,C-3PO,743,Um. How do I look?
744,OWEN,744,Great! You look perfect.
745,C-3PO,745,"Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so
happy!"
746,(extending his hand to shake hers),746,"Oh, pardon me."
747,"THREEPIO
(continuing)",747,Thank you.
748,"C-3PO
(continuing)",748,Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
749,"OWEN
(grinning)",749,"Well, Padme, I think he should be
yours from now on... I know that
is what my Mom would want."
750,C-3PO,750,"Oh, my!"
751,BERU (V.O.),751,"Come topside, everybody! He's
back! He's back!"
752,OBI-WAN,752,"...Alliance have pledged their
armies to Count Dooku and are
forming an... Wait!... ah...
attack... I don't... make it...
aaaggghhh!"
753,ANAKIN,753,I'm going after him!
754,PADME,754,"I thought the first thing he said
was to retransmit his message to
Coruscant."
755,ANAKIN,755,"Yeah, you're right, you're right."
756,MACE WINDU,756,"We will deal with Count Dooku. The
most important thing for you,
Anakin, is to stay where you are.
Protect the Senator at all costs.
That is your priority."
757,ANAKIN,757,"Understood, Master."
758,PADME,758,"They'll never get there in time to
save him. They have to come half
way across the galaxy. Look,
Geonosis is less than a parsec away."
759,ANAKIN,759,If he's still alive.
760,PADME,760,"Annie, are you just going to sit
here and let him die?? He's your
friend... your mentor..."
761,ANAKIN,761,"...He's like my father, but you
heard Master Windu. He gave me
strict orders to stay here."
762,PADME,762,"He gave you strict orders to
protect me..."
763,"PADME
(continuing)",763,"...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan.
So if you plan to protect me, you
will have to come along."
764,MACE WINDU,764,"The longer we wait, the stronger
Dooku's armies become. We cannot
wait for the Senate to make up its
mind about granting the Chancellor
emergency powers, in order to be
able to use that clone army... We
have the authority to go now. We
must go now."
765,YODA,765,"Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred
Jedi send. Enough, let's hope
they are."
766,MAS AMEDDA,766,Order! Order!!
767,PALPATINE,767,"In the regrettable absence of
Senator Amidala, the chair
recognises Senior
Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar
Binks."
768,JAR JAR,768,"Senators, dellow felagates..."
769,MAS AMEDDA,769,"Order! The Senate will accord the
Representative the courtesy of a
hearing!"
770,JAR JAR,770,"In response to the direct threat
to the Republic from the
Confederacy of Independent
Systems, I propose that the Senate
gives immediate emergency powers to
the Supreme Chancellor."
771,"JAR JAR
(continuing)",771,"Who can deny these are exceptional
times? Exceptional times demand
exceptional measures!
Exceptional measures demand
exceptional men!"
772,ORN FREE TAA,772,We won't support a dictator.
773,JAR JAR,773,"That is the sentiment every one of
us agrees with! And when the
shadow of war has dispersed and
the bright day of liberty has
dawned once again, the power we now
give to the Supreme Chancellor
will be gladly, and swiftly
returned. Out ancient liberties
will be restored to us, burnished
even more brightly than before!"
774,PALPATINE,774,"It is with great reluctance that
I have agreed to this calling. I
love democracy... I love the
Republic. The fact that this
crisis is demanding I be given
absolute power to tule over you is
evident. But I am mild by nature
and have no desire to destroy
the democratic process. The power you
give me I will lay down when this
crisis has abated, I promise you.
And all I ask in return is when my
current term of office is over,
you allow me to reture and live
out my life in peace."
775,MAS AMEDDA,775,"We shall proceed to the vote. All
those in favor of granting
emergency powers to the Supreme
Chancellor, signal ate at this
time... those opposed?"
776,ANAKIN,776,"Hey, where are you going?"
777,PADME,777,To find Obi-Wan.
778,ANAKIN,778,No! You're not!
779,PADME,779,Let go of me!
780,ANAKIN,780,"I'm not letting you go out there.
It's too dangerous."
781,PADMÉ,781,What?!?
782,ANAKIN,782,"It's my job to protect you. I said
it's too dangerous. You're not
going, and that's final!"
783,PADMÉ,783,"Don't you give me orders, Annie!
I'm a Senator of the Galactic
Republic. You have no authority
to contain me, restrain me, or
direct me! You remember your
place, young man."
784,(standing up),784,"Now you can come along and protect
me or stay here. It's up to you."
785,C-3PO,785,"Yes, it is, Artoo. Most
confusing. One moment they're
generating a pleasant mutual
attraction and the next, waves of
violent hostility. Even though
I'm programmed to understand them,
I doubt if I ever shall."
786,"PADME
(in a low voice)",786,It's empty!
787,PADME,787,Wait!
788,COUNT DOOKU,788,"Senator Amidala, I've heard so
much about you."
789,PADMÉ,789,"Count Dooku, I assume."
790,COUNT DOOKU,790,"I'm delighted to meet you at
last. We have a great deal to
discuss, Senator. I hope you can
keep your young Jedi under control."
791,PADMÉ,791,Don't worry he's housebroken.
792,PADMÉ,792,"You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-
Wan Kenobi. I am formally
requesting you turn him over to
me, now."
793,DOOKU,793,"He has been convicted of
espionage, Senator, and will be
executed. In just a few hours, I
believe."
794,PADMÉ,794,"He is an officer of the Republic.
You can't do that."
795,DOOKU,795,"We don't recognise the Republic
here, Senator. But if Naboo were
to join our Alliance, I could
easily hear your plea for clemency."
796,PADMÉ,796,"And if I don't join your
rebellion, I assume this Jedi with
me will also die?"
797,DOOKU,797,"I don't wish to make you to join
our cause against your will,
Senator, but you are a rational,
honest representative of your
people and I assume you want to do
what's in their best interest.
Aren't you fed up with the
corruption, the bureaucrats, the
hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't
you? Be honest, Senator."
798,PADMÉ,798,"The ideals are still alive, Count,
even if the institution is failing."
799,DOOKU,799,"You believe in the same ideals we
believe in! The same ideals we
are striving to make prominent."
800,PADMÉ,800,"If what you say is true, you
should stay in the Republic and
help Chancellor Palpatine put
things right."
801,DOOKU,801,"The Chancellor means well, M'Lady
but he is incompetent. He has
promised to cut the bureaucracy,
but the bureaucrats are stronger
than ever, no? Senator, the
Republic cannot be fixed. It is
time to start over. The
democratic process in the Republic
is a sham, a shell game played
on the voters. It will not be long
before the cult of greed, called
the Republic, will lose even the
pretext of democracy and freedom."
802,PADMÉ,802,"I cannot believe that. I will not
forsake all I have honoured and
worked for and betray the
Republic. I know of your treaties
with the Trade Federation, the
Commerce Guilds, and the others,
Count. What is happening here is
not government that has been
bought out by business... it's
business becoming government!"
803,DOOKU,803,"Are you willing to betray your Jedi
friends? Without your co-operation
I can do nothing to stop their
execution."
804,PADMÉ,804,"What is to happen to me? Am I to be
executed also?"
805,DOOKU,805,"I wouldn't think of such an
offence. But, there are
individuals who have a strong
interest in your demise, M'lady.
It has nothing to do with
politics, I'm afraid. It's purely
personal, and they have already
paid great sums to have you
assassinated. I'm sure they will
push hard to have you included in
the executions. I'm sorry but if
you are not going to co-operate, I
must turn you over to the
Geonosians for justice. I've done
all I can for you."
806,JANGO FETT,806,I'll take that weapon.
807,DOOKU,807,"You may cause a lot of bloodshed,
my young Jedi, but you will not
escape."
808,PADMÉ,808,Anakin...
809,SUN RIT,809,"You have been charged and found
guilty of Espionage."
810,POGGLE,810,"Do you have anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?"
811,PADMÉ,811,"You are committing an act of war,
Archduke. I hope you are prepared
for the consequences."
812,POGGLE,812,"We build weapons, Senator... that
is our business! Of course we're
prepared!"
813,NUTE GUNRAY,813,"Get on with it. Carry out the
sentence. I want to see her suffer."
814,POGGLE,814,"Your other Jedi friend is waiting
for you, Senator. Take them to
the arena!"
815,ANAKIN,815,Don't be afraid.
816,PADMÉ,816,"I'm not afraid to die. I've been
dying a little bit each day since
you came back into my life."
817,ANAKIN,817,What are you talking about?
818,PADMÉ,818,I love you.
819,ANAKIN,819,"You love me?! I thought we
decided not to fall in love. That
we would be forced to live a lie.
That it would destroy our lives..."
820,PADMÉ,820,"I think our lives are about to be
destroyed anyway. My love for you
is a puzzle, Annie, for which I
have no answers. I can't control
it... and now I don't care. I
truly, deeply love you, and before
we die I want you to know."
821,ANAKIN,821,"I have no desire to be cured of
this love either. Long or short,
I vow to spend the rest of my life
with you."
822,OBI-WAN,822,"I was beginning to wonder if you
had gotten my message."
823,ANAKIN,823,"I retransmitted it as you
requested, Master. Then we decided
to come and rescue you."
824,OBI-WAN,824,"It looks like you're going a good
job so far."
825,SUN RIT,825,"The felons before you have been
convicted of espionage against the
Sovereign System of Geonosis.
Their sentence of death is to be
carried out in this public arena
henceforth."
826,POGGLE,826,Let the executions begin!
827,ANAKIN,827,I have a bad feeling about this.
828,OBI-WAN,828,"Take the one the left. I'll
take the one on the right."
829,ANAKIN,829,What about Padme?
830,OBI-WAN,830,"It looks like she's already on top
of things."
831,NUTE GUNRAY,831,"Foul!! She can't do that... shoot
her or something!"
832,ANAKIN,832,You okay?
833,"PADME
(nods, gasping)",833,"Sure! Well, sort of."
834,ANAKIN,834,Jump!!!
835,NUTE GUNRAY,835,"This isn't how it's supposed to
be! Jango, finish her off."
836,"COUNT DOOKU
(smiling enigmatically)",836,"Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.
Maybe this is the way it's
supposed to end."
837,C-3PO,837,"Yes, it has been rather a long
time. Do you suppose something's
happened to them?"
838,"C-3PO
(continuing)",838,"Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think
so. It looks a very dull planet
to me. They should be back
shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo."
839,COUNT DOOKU,839,"Master Windu, how pleasant of you
to join us. You're just in time
for the moment of truth. I would
think these two new boys of yours
could use a little more training."
840,MACE WINDU,840,"Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
This party's over."
841,"COUNT DOOKU
(to Mace Windu)",841,"Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi
friend. You're impossibly
outnumbered."
842,MACE WINDU,842,"I don't think so. One Jedi has to
be worth a hundred Geonosians."
843,COUNT DOOKU,843,"It wasn't the Geonosians I was
thinking about. How well do you
think one Jedi will hold up
against a thousand battle droids?"
844,C-3PO,844,I don't hear anything.
845,(Artoo beeps),845,"You're scaring me! Stop imagining
things!"
846,OBI-WAN,846,"Someone's got to - shut down -
these droids."
847,MACE WINDU,847,"Don't worry! It's being - taken
care of!"
848,PLO KOON,848,"We've done it! Now we have a
chance!"
849,KI-ADI-MUNDI,849,"The system's off but they're still
active. That's a new feature. They
are independent of the control
system."
850,COUNT DOOKU,850,Master Windu!
851,"COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)",851,"You have fought gallantly. Worthy
of recognition in the history
archives of the Jedi Order. Now
it is finished."
852,(pauses briefly),852,"Surrender - and your lives will be
spared."
853,MACE WINDU,853,"We will not be hostages for you to
barter with Dooku."
854,COUNT DOOKU,854,"Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You
will have to be destroyed."
855,PADME,855,Look!
856,YODA,856,Come on - hurry! Hurry!
857,YODA,857,"More battalions to the left.
Encircle them we must, then
divide."
858,C-3PO,858,"I'm sure I heard something, this
time. Didn't you? It's probably
just a celebration"
859,OBI-WAN,859,Hold on! Look over there...
860,ANAKIN,860,"It's Dooku, go after him!"
861,"ANAKIN
(continuing)",861,Padme!!!
862,"ANAKIN
(continuing; to pilot)",862,Put the ship down! Down!
863,OBI-WAN,863,"No! Forget her. We have to go
after Dooku."
864,ANAKIN,864,No we're not!! Land this ship!
865,OBI-WAN,865,"Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way. We've got a job to
do."
866,ANAKIN,866,I don't care!.. Go back.
867,OBI-WAN,867,Anakin! She's all right! Look.
868,"OBI-WAN
(continuing)",868,Follow that speeder!
869,DROID CAPTAIN,869,Your Excellency!
870,COUNT DOOKU,870,"That won't be necessary, Captain.
Stand down. And leave them to me."
871,"OBI-WAN
(to Anakin)",871,"We move in together - you slowly
on the..."
872,ANAKIN,872,I'm taking him now!
873,OBI-WAN,873,"Anakin, no!"
874,ANAKIN,874,"You'll pay for all the Jedi you've
killed today, Dooku."
875,COUNT DOOKU,875,"Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see,
my Jedi powers are far beyond
yours. Now, back down."
876,OBI-WAN,876,I don't think so.
877,COUNT DOOKU,877,"Ah, but if I must."
878,"COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)",878,"I have spent the last ten years
learning to use the power of the
Dark Side. It gives me infinitely
greater power."
879,OBI-WAN,879,You will have to prove it.
880,COUNT DOOKU,880,"Grand Master Kenobi, you
disappoint me. Yoda holds you in
such high esteem."
881,"COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)",881,Surely you can do better...?
882,(parries),882,"No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi
swordsmanship degenerated so
quickly, or are you trying to make
fun of me?"
883,(cuts),883,Which is it?
884,"COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)",884,"come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me
out of my misery."
885,"COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)",885,"That's brave of you, boy - but
foolish. I would have thought
you'd have learnt your lesson."
886,ANAKIN,886,I'm a slow learner.
887,COUNT DOOKU,887,"You have unusual powers, young
Padawan. But not enought to save
you this time."
888,ANAKIN,888,Don't bet on it!
889,OBI-WAN,889,Anakin!
890,COUNT DOOKU,890,"Master Yoda. At last we shall
know who is the most powerful."
891,YODA,891,"Count Dooku. No interest in
contests, do I have."
892,"YODA
(continuing)",892,"The end for you, Count, this is."
893,COUNT DOOKU,893,...Not yet...
894,PADMÉ,894,Anakin!
895,CLONE CAPTAIN,895,"Resistance is at an end, General.
What are your orders ?"
896,COUNT DOOKU,896,"The Force is with us, my Master."
897,DARTH SIDIOUS,897,"Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have
done well."
898,COUNT DOOKU,898,"I bring you good news, my Lord.
The war has begun."
899,DARTH SIDIOUS,899,Excellent.
900,(smiling),900,Everything is going as planned.
901,MACE WINDU,901,Where is your apprentice?
902,OBI-WAN,902,"On his way back to Naboo. He is
escorting Senator Amidala home."
903,"OBI-WAN
(continuing)",903,"I must admit without the clones,
it would not have been a victory."
904,YODA,904,"Victory? Victory, you say?"
905,"YODA
(continuing)",905,"Not victory, a defeat, it was...
Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone
War has!"
