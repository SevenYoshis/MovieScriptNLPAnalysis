us."
1,KASIMOV,1,"I don't remember what happened!  We were
at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having
fun."
2,KASIMOV,2,"I don't even know how I got here.
I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I
didn't lay a finger on her."
3,ANATOLY,3,Kasimov.  Don't flounder.
4,JACK,4,"Jesus, she's been under too long.  Come
on, come on!"
5,KASIMOV,5,You're the only one who can help me.
6,ANATOLY,6,"C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon."
7,KASIMOV,7,They'll kill me.
8,ANATOLY,8,"You asked for my help.  You
asked
for
my
help...come on..."

10,JACK,10,The name pal...give us the name.
11,KASIMOV,11,"The contact in Minsk..the contact in
Minsk..works in a travel agency."
12,JACK,12,Come on!
13,ANATOLY,13,Come on!
14,KASIMOV,14,His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
15,ANATOLY,15,Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
16,JACK,16,Got him.
17,ANATOLY,17,"Now, we drink."
18,ANATOLY (CONT'D),18,To friends.
19,KASIMOV,19,"Yes, Anatoly, yes."
20,JACK,20,Cheers.
21,JACK,21,"and tears away a mask of flesh

22,ETHAN,22,Get rid of this scum.
23,CLAIRE,23,Did we get it?
24,ETHAN,24,We got it.  On your feet.
25,CLAIRE,25,I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
26,ETHAN,26,"Walk, just walk.  Start walking."
27,CLAIRE,27,I'm walking.
28,ETHAN,28,"Talking's good, walking's better."
29,CLAIRE,29,Sleeping's better.
30,CLAIRE,30,"Are
you
all right Ethan.  What's wrong
with you?"
31,ETHAN,31,"If you're gonna do this again Claire,
It's not gonna be on my watch."
32,CLAIRE,32,Oh yeah?
33,JACK,33,Claire.
34,ETHAN,34,Jack.
35,ETHAN,35,"IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT
OUT OF HERE YET?!"
36,JACK,36,"Just waiting for you, tubs."
37,VOICE (O.S.),37,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off
at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight
thousand feet-and we should be arriving
in Prague right on schedule."
38,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,38,Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen?
39,"FLIGHT ATTENDANT
(CONT'D)",39,"Would you like to watch a movie Mr
Phelps?"
40,PHELPS,40,"No, I prefer the theatre."
41,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,41,"Would you consider the cinema of the
Ukraine?"
42,PHELPS,42,Perhaps you'd choose one for me.
43,KITTRIDGE,43,"Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're
about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn --"
44,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),44,"-- a former KGB Line X officer now
working the international black market
selling intelligence.  This morning, we
learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half
of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non-
official cover agents working in Eastern
Europe."
45,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),45,"For security reasons, the NOC list is
divided into two encoded halves.
Golitsyn already has the cryptonym
portion, which contains agent code names
and targeting areas.  This portion is
useless unless combined with the second
half -- the true name list that is kept
in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague."
46,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),46,"We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the
true name list at an Embassy function
tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you
decide to accept it, is to obtain
photographic proof of the theft, apprehend
those involved, and return the stolen
list.  I don't have to stress the
importance of this matter, Jim.  We're
keeping it internally black. Because of
its urgency, I've already sent to Prague
a team selected from your usual group."
47,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),47,"Ethan Hunt will of course be your point
man, as usual.  He's in Kiev; we're
getting word to him now."
48,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),48,"As always, should you or any member of
your IM force be caught or killed, the
Secretary will disavow all knowledge of
your actions.  This tape will self-
destruct in five seconds.  Good luck,
Jim!"
49,JACK,49,"Look to your right, then back to me.
There's a camera built right into the
bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and
transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?"
50,SARAH,50,Of course I can hear you.
51,JACK,51,"No, in your...ear piece. You have a
lovely smile (eyes). Can you hear me
now?"
52,SARAH,52,Loud and clear.
53,JACK,53,What's going on?
54,SARAH,54,I don't know.
55,JACK,55,Why don't you take a look?
56,SARAH,56,Jack...that's spying.
57,JACK,57,That's what we do isn't it?
58,SARAH,58,Jack you're so wicked.
59,JACK,59,Too wicked to have a drink later?
60,SARAH,60,I think I might just take that look.
61,ETHAN,61,"Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more
than ninety days leave coming."
62,PHELPS,62,"A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is.
Take it all, if you want.
After
this one."
63,ETHAN,63,I thought I'd take some now.
64,PHELPS,64,"What the hell's made you decide to take
your leave at the worst possible time?
Claire's in a weird mood too."
65,ETHAN,65,Oh?  What's the problem?
66,PHELPS,66,"I don't know, I had to go to Chicago
again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me."
67,ETHAN,67,Tell you what?
68,PHELPS,68,"When you started noticing your short term
memory loss.  What
the problem was
you
and Claire had in Kiev?"
69,ETHAN,69,What problem?
70,PHELPS,70,"Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking
burnout here?"
71,ETHAN,71,I guess.
72,PHELPS,72,"Ethan, you
can't
burn out."
73,ETHAN,73,Why not?
74,PHELPS,74,"Because I can't afford it. And because
you'd burn up before you'd burn out."
75,ETHAN,75,How was Chicago?
76,PHELPS,76,"Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto
dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the
one about the astronaut who comes back
from the first manned flight to Mars
after two years?  His wife's got a year
old kid.  So he says ""All right.  Who was
it?  My friend Harry?""  She says no. ""Oh,
it was my friend Sammy.""  She says it
wasn't Sammy.  ""Oh, I suppose it was my
friend Lou.""  ""No, what's the matter,
don't you think I have any friends of my
own?!"""
77,PHELPS (CONT'D),77,"Boy, you really are grim. Come here,
take a look."
78,PHELPS (CONT'D),78,"Beyond Charles Bridge there is our
Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if
anything goes wrong, this guy will steal
the names of our agents in every country
all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to
the highest bidders -- third world
terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords --
any and everybody who'd love to get rid
of long term coverts like us, and some
very dear friends among them.  If they're
exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over
here.  Take a lock at this."
79,SENATOR WALTZER,79,"I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA
and all its shadow organizations have
become irrelevant at best and
unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we
throw a little light on the whole concept
of the Pentagon's ""black budget.""  These
covert agency subgroups have confidential
funding, they report to no one --
who are
these people
?!  We
were
living in a
democracy the last time I checked."
80,ETHAN,80,You're going to use Walter?
81,PHELPS,81,He's our guy.
82,ETHAN,82,Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
83,PHELPS,83,"Not this week. This week he's flyfishing
at the Oughterard Slough in County
Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides."
84,ETHAN,84,He won't be back in a hurry?
85,PHELPS,85,"No, not in a hurry.  What do you think?
You think the plot'll work?"
86,ETHAN,86,Sure.  If the main character does.
87,PHELPS,87,"If you were me, Ethan, who would
you
trust to make him believable?"
88,JACK,88,"Sorry, am I interrupting?"
89,ETHAN,89,Always.
90,JACK,90,"Stick of gum. If you come up against a
lock you can't pick --"
91,JACK (CONT'D),91,"Red light.  Green light.  Mash them
together, asta lasagna.  Don't get any on
you -- you have five seconds."
92,PHELPS,92,Are you gonna take it?
93,ETHAN,93,Give me the God damn gum.
94,JACK,94,Just don't chew it.
95,PHELPS,95,Thank you.
96,PHELPS,96,"a gray metal box
, protruding from the wall one floor up."
97,PHELPS,97,"Ethan.  Jack's inside.  Window's open by
twenty-three hundred."
98,DIPLOMAT,98,"How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman,
the Ambassador's aide.  If I could just
steer you through the reception line here"
99,DIPLOMAT (CONT'D),99,"Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the
director of the National Gallery -- Petr
Brandl, the mayor of Prague --"
100,SARAH,100,"I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator?"
101,SENATOR WALTZER,101,"Of course I do.  How are you, Miss
Norman?"
102,SARAH,102,He's in pocket.  Under the archway behind me.
103,PHELPS,103,"Sarah, mark the package and go to two."
104,SARAH,104,"Your advance team mentioned you'd want a
tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead
and set that up for you --"
105,SENATOR WALTZER,105,Terrific.  Let's get going.
106,SENATOR WALTZER,106,Will you excuse us?
107,DIPLOMAT,107,"Uh, sir?"
108,JACK,108,Great.  Come on.
109,PHELPS,109,Hannah.  He's marked.  Lets go.
110,HANNAH,110,En route.
111,PHELPS (O/S),111,"Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to
night vision)."
112,JACK,112,Governor's in position.  We have the elevator.
113,GUARD,113,"Excuse me, can I help you?"
114,SARAH,114,"-- which leads directly to the Denied
Area, the only limited access area in the
whole facility."
115,SARAH (CONT'D),115,"As you can see. this area has both a
Marine guard and video surveillance, and
is strictly monitored at all times."
116,SARAH (CONT'D),116,"Senator, don't you have a young man on
your staff named"
117,ETHAN,117,"Jack
?  I believe we did have a young man
named
Jack
.  Not a reliable man, as I
recall.  Constantly late or behind in his
work."
118,GUARD,118,"Excuse me, let me see that ID again!"
119,PHELPS (O.S.),119,"Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a
second.  Keep dancing."
120,ETHAN (O.S.),120,"We were forced to tie him to my best
stallion and drag him around the barn a
few times."
121,JACK,121,"Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on
it."
122,GUARD,122,"Oh. Sorry, sir."
123,JACK,123,"The drink (date) with Sarah is definitely
off."
124,PHELPS,124,Hannah -- I'm blind again.  Hannah.
125,HANNAH,125,He's heading to the denied area.
126,ETHAN,126,Higher.  Higher.
127,SARAH,127,Higher.
128,ETHAN,128,"Right, right.  Good."
129,PHELPS,129,"Get moving, Ethan.  He's rolling to you."
130,ETHAN,130,Jack we're in position.
131,ETHAN,131,Jack.  Jack.
132,JACK,132,I didn't touch it.
133,PHELPS,133,"He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box!"
134,ETHAN,134,"OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open
the doors."
135,SARAH,135,What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
136,JACK (O.S.),136,I don't have it.
137,PHELPS,137,Opening the doors.  Go under.
138,ETHAN,138,He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
139,JACK (O.S.),139,"Give me a break, Pops."
140,SARAH,140,Such a nice ass.
141,JACK (O.S.),141,And a lonely ass.
142,ETHAN,142,"Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport
in five minutes."
143,CLAIRE (O.S.),143,Roger that.
144,ETHAN,144,"In position.  Jack open the door, let the
package roll."
145,JACK (O.S.),145,Roger that.  Opening doors now.
146,ETHAN,146,"Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to
transport."
147,HANNAH,147,En route.
148,JACK,148,Hey.
149,PHELPS,149,"Jack, what are you doing?!"
150,JACK,150,"Iím not doing anything!  (I donít have it
either)."
151,PHELPS,151,"I donít have it --
I donít have
control"
152,JACK,152,Uh -- then I have a problem.
153,ETHAN,153,"Cut the power.  Cut the power Jack.  Do
you hear me."
154,ETHAN (O.S.),154,"Come on, Jack, come on."
155,ETHAN (O.S.),155,and heís crushed to death against the roof
156,ETHAN,156,Jack.  Jack.

162,PHELPS (O.S.),162,Iíve got a shadow.
163,ETHAN,163,Can you lose him?
164,PHELPS (O.S.),164,No.  Abort.
165,SARAH,165,Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
166,ETHAN,166,Jim we canít.
167,PHELPS (O.S.),167,Abort.  Thatís an order.
168,ETHAN,168,"Negative

169,PHELPS (O.S.),169,"No, damn it, no, I said ABORT!"
170,ETHAN,170,"Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím
coming to you."
171,SARAH,171,"Jim gave an abort, we should walk
away."
172,ETHAN,172,"No, weíre going to recover the disk,
understand?!  Now move!"
173,PHELPS (O.S.),173,Where are you?
174,ETHAN,174,About two hundred yards from the bridge.
175,PHELPS (O.S.),175,"Theyíre covering this frequency, Ethan.

Cut all radio communications."

190,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),190,Whoís dead?
191,ETHAN,191,"My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim -
- Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know"
192,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),192,Are you damaged?
193,ETHAN,193,"They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís
dead too.  The disk is gone."
194,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),194,Are you intact
195,ETHAN,195,"Do you read me?
The list is in the open"
196,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),196,"Let's just bring you in safely, and then
we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you
followed?"
197,ETHAN,197,I donít think so.
198,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),198,"Donít
think
, be
sure
.  Are you clean?"
199,ETHAN,199,Yes.
200,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),200,"Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there
myself."
201,ETHAN,201,Youíre in Prague?
202,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),202,"Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít
disappoint me."
203,ETHAN,203,No sir.
204,KITTRIDGE (O.S.),204,One hour.
205,KITTRIDGE,205,"I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know
how much Jim in particular meant to you,
Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally."
206,ETHAN,206,Yeah.
207,KITTRIDGE,207,"Passport, visas - you know the drill.
We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada,
debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague
police a bone, you know toss them a few
suspects.  Follow me?"
208,ETHAN,208,Yeah.  I follow you.
209,KITTRIDGE,209,We've lost enough agents for one night.
210,ETHAN,210,"You mean
I've
lost enough agents for one
night."
211,KITTRIDGE,211,"You seem hell bent on blaming yourself,
Ethan."
212,ETHAN,212,Who else is left?
213,KITTRIDGE,213,Yes.  I see your point.
214,ETHAN,214,Why was there another team?
215,KITTRIDGE,215,What?
216,ETHAN,216,Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
217,KITTRIDGE,217,I don't quite follow you.
218,ETHAN,218,"Let's see if you can follow me around
this room."
219,ETHAN,219,"The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7
and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing
around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11.
The waiter behind Hannah at the top of
the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The
other IMF team.  You're worried about me.
Why"
220,KITTRIDGE,220,"You're right.  Maybe this'll save some
time."
221,KITTRIDGE (CONT'D),221,"For a little over two years now we've
been spotting serious blowback in IMF
operations.  We have a penetration.  The
other day we decoded a message on the
Internet from a Czech we know as ""Max."""
222,ETHAN,222,The arms dealer.
223,KITTRIDGE,223,"That's right.  Max, it seems, has two
unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.
This time he's gotten to someone on the
inside - he's put himself in a position
to buy our NOC list. An operation he
referred to as ""Job 314"".  The job he
thought Golitsyn was doing tonight."
224,ETHAN,224,But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
225,KITTRIDGE,225,"Correct the actual list is safe at
Langley.  ""Golitsyn"" was a lightning rod,
one of ours."
226,ETHAN,226,This whole operation was a molehunt.
227,KITTRIDGE,227,"Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like
you said.  You survived."
228,KITTRIDGE (CONT'D),228,"I want to show you something, Ethan."
229,KITTRIDGE (CONT'D),229,"Since your father's death, your family's
farm has been in sub-chapter S and now,
suddenly, they're flush with over a
hundred and twenty grand in the bank.
Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped
out the bank account -- dying slowly in
America after all, can be a very
expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why
don't we go quietly out of here onto the
plane..."
230,ETHAN,230,"How about if we just go quietly into the
bathroom and I wash your mouth out with
soap - you pathetic button down
bureaucratic asshole."
231,KITTRIDGE (CONT'D),231,"Ethan, I can understand you're very
upset."
232,ETHAN,232,"Kitteridge, you've never seen me very
upset."
233,KITTRIDGE,233,"All right, enough is  enough Hunt. You've
bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on
intimate loyalties to get away with it.

four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am,
four o'clock --!"
273,CLAIRE,273,Why haven't they brought us in yet?
274,ETHAN,274,"I've been disavowed.  They think I killed
Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred
thousand dollars found its way into my
parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes
I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've
been in the employ of an arms dealer,
Max, for the last two years, to get him
our NOC list."
275,CLAIRE,275,What are you going to do?
276,ETHAN,276,"I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the
mole is, I think goes by the name of Job,
at least part of the time. 1 can't find
him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list,
he'll find me."
277,CLAIRE,277,"Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me
go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going
to tell him you had nothing to do..."
278,ETHAN,278,"Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not
dead, he's going to assume you're with
me."
279,ETHAN,279,?        JOB - CORNER OF NEKAZANKA AND PRlKOPY ONE P.M.
280,CLAIRE,280,The message is for Job.
281,ETHAN,281,I'm going to answer it.
282,ETHAN,282,"Excuse me, could I trouble you for a
match?"
283,MATTHIAS,283,Would you remove your hat please?
284,ETHAN,284,Why?
285,MATTHIAS,285,"You wish to meet Max?  This is the price
of admission."
286,ETHAN,286,I thought I was going to see Max.
287,MATTHIAS,287,You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
288,ETHAN,288,Then what am I doing here?
289,MATTHIAS,289,"Allowing Max to see you and hear what
you've got to say."
290,ETHAN,290,"I don't communicate very well through a
shroud."
291,MATTHIAS,291,"If Max doesn't like what you have to say,
you'll be wearing that shroud
indefinitely."
292,ETHAN,292,I'm willing to take the chance.
293,MATTHIAS,293,Very well.
294,MAX,294,Who are you and what are you doing here?
295,ETHAN,295,I need one hundred thousand dollars.
296,MAX,296,"Really?  And you thought if you simply
showed up I might give it to you?"
297,ETHAN,297,"Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and
twenty five thousand."
298,MAX,298,"The penny drops.
You
are
not
Job.  Yes,
Job is not given to quoting Scripture in
his communications. And there was its
tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is
not playful.  So you're something of a
paradox."
299,ETHAN,299,That depends.
300,MAX,300,On what?
301,ETHAN,301,"Whether you like a paradox.  I want a
hundred and fifty thousand dollars."
302,MAX,302,It's quite out of the question.
303,ETHAN,303,"The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's
bait, part of an internal molehunt."
304,MAX,304,"And how might you know that?  Are you
another Company man?"
305,ETHAN,305,Like Job?
306,MAX,306,"Ah, but, we're asking about you."
307,ETHAN,307,"I'm NOC.  Was.
Now
disavowed."
308,MAX,308,"Why, may I ask?"
309,ETHAN,309,That's the question I want to ask Job.
310,MAX,310,"I don't know Job any more than he knows
me."
311,ETHAN,311,"Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an
introduction."
312,MAX,312,Why should I?
313,ETHAN,313,"Because I can deliver the actual NOC
list.  The one you have is not only
worthless, it's certain to be equipped
with a homing device to pinpoint your
exact location."
314,MAX,314,"It's easy to say the disk is worthless
when you say I can't look at the
information and
see
if it's worthless.
Not a tenable position, sir."
315,ETHAN,315,"Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from
thirty seconds to ten minutes you're
gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping
around you like jackrabbits."
316,MAX,316,Mm - Hmmm...
317,ETHAN,317,"Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner
you used in the car?"
318,MAX,318,Very good.
319,ETHAN,319,"Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up
first."
320,MATTHIAS,320,"Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so
good."
321,MAX,321,"That's not so good for you, my friend."
322,MATTHIAS,322,Thirty-two and change.
323,MAX,323,"Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just
be the hard drive heating up."
324,MATTHIAS,324,Forty-four.  Forty-five.
325,ETHAN,325,I'd say you've got about two minutes.
326,MATTHIAS,326,Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine.
327,FEMALE IMF,327,Switch it on.  Keep cleaning.
328,KITTRIDGE,328,GOD D-
329,MAX,329,"Oh dear, Gunther will never let me use
one of his apartments again."
330,MAX,330,"Phew, sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
You're a good sport.  Do accept the
compliment."
331,ETHAN,331,"Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?"
332,MAX,332,"I don't have to tell you what a comfort
anonymity can be in my profession -- like
a warm blanket."
333,MAX,333,"My deal with Job was subject to a
successful boot scan.  Obviously it
didn't pass muster.  Deal's off."
334,ETHAN,334,What was your deal with Job?
335,MAX,335,"Six million dollars.  I'll give you the
same.  But I want the complete list now,
not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this
piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want
the
entire
list, the true name of every
non-official cover agent throughout the
world."
336,ETHAN,336,"Ten
million.  Ten million in negotiable
U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer
form, coupons attached.  And one more
thing -- your personal assurance that Job
will be at the exchange."
337,MAX,337,"Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want
it by the end of the week."
338,ETHAN,338,How will you make sure Job will be there?
339,MAX,339,"How will you make sure I'll have the list
in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now
where can I drop you dear boy?"
340,ETHAN,340,"I'm not being dropped anywhere without my
money."
341,MAX,341,"I'm going to have to front you
personally.  Don't lose that money
without losing your life."
342,ETHAN,342,I wouldn't dream of it.
343,KITTRIDGE,343,"The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under
until he decides to surface."
344,BARNES,344,"Look we can use someone from the Embassy
and we can get the local authorities
involved. Close off his transportation."
345,KITTRIDGE,345,"What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the
airport?  How many identities do you
think Hunt has?  How many times has he
slipped past custom, in how many
countries?  These guys are trained to be
ghosts.
We
taught them how to do it, for
Christ's sake!"
346,BARNES,346,So what do you suggest?
347,KITTRIDGE,347,"Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make
him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure
points.  Find out something that's
important to him personally and you
squeeze."
348,CLAIRE,348,Max made a deal with you?
349,ETHAN,349,"I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job."
350,CLAIRE,350,"We've got seventy-five rounds for your
Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig
Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with
monitor, plenty of passports. You said
it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with
you."
351,ETHAN,351,You're sure about this?
352,CLAIRE,352,"Jim was my husband. I want to know who
killed him. ( ALT ) I want to get the son
of a bitch who did this."
353,ETHAN,353,"We need help, and we don't have time.
They have to be local."

367,KRIEGER (CONT'D),367,Is he serious?
368,CLAIRE,368,Always.
369,KRIEGER,369,"If we're going to Virginia, why don't we

excuses."
389,LUTHER,389,"I can't just hack my way inside.  There's
no modem access to the mainframe, it's in
a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically
at the terminal."
390,ETHAN,390,"Luther, relax, it's worse than you think.
The terminal's in black vault lock-down."
391,ETHAN (V.O.),391,"They missed nothing in that room.  Even
the vents have laser nets over them."
392,ETHAN (V.O.),392,"Inside, there are three countermeasure
systems that can only be deactivated by
authorized entry.  Which we won't have."
393,ETHAN (V.O.),393,"The first system is sound-sensitive,
anything above a whisper sets it off.
The second system is on the floor and
pressure-sensitive --"
394,ETHAN (V.O.),394,"--and the third detects any increase in
temperature.  Even the body heat of an
unauthorized person in the room will
trigger it."
395,ETHAN (V.O.),395,All three systems are state of the art.
396,LUTHER,396,And you really think we can do this.
397,ETHAN,397,May I come in?
398,CLAIRE,398,Sure...
399,ETHAN,399,"It's cash. And a second passport. If
anything goes wrong when we're inside, if
you sense even the slightest deviation
don't look over your shoulder, you walk
away - you hear me? Just walk away."
400,CLAIRE,400,You don't think we're going to make it.

make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald
down to the county courthouse?"
528,KITTRIDGE,528,"I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?"
529,BARNES,529,Lost him.  We needed three more seconds.
530,KITTRIDGE,530,He wanted us to know he was in London.
531,KITTRIDGE,531,The man is JIM PHELPS
532,PHELPS,532,You're a hard man to catch up with.
533,PHELPS,533,"..the next day I managed to drag myself
to the safe house, must've just missed
you..anyway, I checked our aliases."
534,ETHAN,534,- and picked us up in the States -
535,PHELPS,535,"- but you left before I could get there
and I could check just so many places.."
536,ETHAN,536,"Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize
customs records -"
537,PHELPS,537,"- so I watched Europe. Once you showed
up in England..it was easy."
538,ETHAN,538,"You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool
Street."
539,PHELPS,539,"Hey, I showed 'em to you!"
540,ETHAN,540,I remember..
541,ETHAN,541,"Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A
doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't
sit up straight."
542,PHELPS,542,"I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit
up straight very well.  It's not
important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I
saw the mole.  It was Kittridge."
543,PHELPS,543,Kittridge!
544,ETHAN,544,"Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the
mole?"
545,PHELPS,545,Yeah.
546,ETHAN,546,How did Kittridge do it?..
547,ETHAN VO,547,"- first he took care of Jack in the
elevator -"
548,ETHAN VO,548,- he shot you on the bridge -
549,ETHAN VO,549,"- he must have had back up take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.."
550,ETHAN VO,550,How did he do Hannah?
551,ETHAN VO,551,"No.  No.  He could've taken out Hannah
himself."
552,ETHAN,552,"Why, Jim?
Why?"
553,PHELPS,553,"..when you think about it, Ethan, it was
inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more
secrets you keep from everyone but
yourself, operations you answer to no one
but yourself.  Then one morning you wake
up and find out the President of the
United States is running the country -
without your permission
.  The son-of-a-
bitch!  How
dare
he?  You realize itís
over, youíre an obsolete piece of
hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got
a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a
year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no
good son-of-a-bitch, big time!"
554,ETHAN,554,"We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after
us."
555,PHELPS,555,Whatís going to make him do that?
556,ETHAN,556,"What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC
list."
557,PHELPS,557,"Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you."
558,ETHAN,558,"A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to
Paris."
559,PHELPS,559,Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
560,ETHAN,560,"If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to
Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.
Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with
me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will
have helicopter transport waiting in
Paris."
561,ETHAN,561,Jim...?
562,PHELPS,562,"I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you
and suddenly there she was, standing in
the rain just outside the safe
house..alive and beautiful..and thinking
Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís
had to do forget about me to keep going
and get the job done, I.."
563,PHELPS,563,"- no.  She canít know about me.  No one
can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too
much at stake, Ethan."
564,ETHAN,564,Youíre probably right.
565,PHELPS,565,I usually am.
566,ETHAN,566,"Once we leave the safehouse, get in there
and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris."
567,PHELPS,567,You got it.
568,ETHAN,568,And get a doctor.
569,PHELPS,569,Good luck.
570,CLAIRE,570,What happened?
571,ETHAN,571,"I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for
tomorrow."
572,CLAIRE,572,Okay...
573,ETHAN,573,Is this the only way?
574,CLAIRE,574,Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
575,CLAIRE,575,TGV.  LONDON TERMINUS
576,KITTRIDGE,576,How long to the London Terminus?
577,AGENT,577,"Twenty, twenty-five minutes."
578,KITTRIDGE,578,"Youíve got ten.
Move"
579,MAX,579,How long until we reach the Chunnel?
580,MATTHIAS,580,Twenty minutes.
581,MATTHIAS,581,Yes...
582,MATTHIAS,582,Itís him.
583,MAX,583,This wasnít what we discussed.
584,ETHAN (O.S.),584,"My apologies Max.  Couldnít be helped.
Thereís a piece of black cloth under your
seat.  Tear it away and youíll find the
disk."
585,ETHAN (O.S.),585,IDENTITY MATCH
586,MAX,586,"Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít
prelude a meeting in private."
587,ETHAN (O.S.),587,"It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you
tell me where the money is."
588,MAX,588,"The possibility alone is worth ten
million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver
briefcase.  Combination 314."
589,ETHAN (O.S.),589,What about Job?
590,MAX,590,"I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve
got the money -- heíll find you."
591,MAX,591,and CLAIRE gets up to follow
592,BARNES,592,Only four more cars.
593,KITTRIDGE,593,"And if we donít find him - weíll search
the whole train again."
594,BARNES,594,Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
595,KITTRIDGE,595,"High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No-
one gets off.  High security.  Good place
for a pass off to Max."
596,BARNES,596,But why tell us?
597,KITTRIDGE,597,"Heís putting on a show, Barnes."
598,BARNES,598,What kind of show.
599,KITTRIDGE,599,I donít know.
600,KITTRIDGE,600,It didnít say on the tickets.
601,CLAIRE,601,Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
602,ETHAN,602,"Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How
far is he from Luther?"
603,CLAIRE,603,Two cars.  Where are you?
604,ETHAN,604,You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
605,ETHAN,605,LIST COMPLETE
606,MAX,606,Heís in the baggage car.
607,PHELPS (O/S),607,Iíll be there.
608,PHELPS (O/S),608,MODEM DENIED
609,MAX,609,Whatís the problem.
610,MATTHIAS,610,Connection denied.
611,MAX,611,Try it again.
612,MATTHIAS,612,Itís not working.
613,MAX,613,Is something wrong with the phone?
614,MAX,614,"Well is something wrong with the
batteries?"
615,MATTHIAS,615,I always check the batteries.
616,MAX,616,Run it through from the top.
617,BARNES,617,"Nothing but civilians, Gene."
618,KITTRIDGE,618,"This is bullshit - we donít even know
what Max looks like."
619,BARNES,619,"Maybe we donít have to know what he looks
like.  If heís got that list, heís going
to want to check it.  We should be
looking for laptops."
620,KITTRIDGE,620,Good idea.
621,WAITER,621,"Excuse me, Sir, your telephone..."
622,WAITER,622,TRANSFER IN PROGRESS
623,MATTHIAS,623,Itís working.
624,MAX,624,Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...
625,ETHAN (O/S),625,"Iíve got the money.  Meet me in the
baggage car."
626,KITTRIDGE,626,Get this door open.
627,KITTRIDGE,627,"Hello, Luther.  Whereís Hunt?"
628,LUTHER,628,"Mr. Kittridge, the NOC list is being
modemed off the train."
629,KITTRIDGE,629,Where?
630,CLAIRE,630,"Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me
Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him?
We take the money.  Ethan takes the
blame.  No-one else has seen you alive.
No-one will believe him."
631,ETHAN,631,"Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say
that Claire."
632,CLAIRE,632,Ethan?
633,PHELPS,633,"Yes.  Ethan Hunt, darling.  Remember him?"
634,CLAIRE,634,You knew about Jim?
635,PHELPS,635,"Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew
is something of a question.  Before or
after I showed in London, mind telling
me, Ethan?"
636,ETHAN,636,"Before London.  But after you took the
Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago."
637,PHELPS,637,"They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn
Gideons."
638,PHELPS,638,"Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll
have to be quicker than Iíd like.
Certainly quicker than youíd like."
639,CLAIRE,639,"Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why.."
640,PHELPS,640,"Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk?
Well, Claire, youíve asked the question
and you are the answer."
641,ETHAN,641,I knew about Jim.
642,PHELPS,642,"But, he didnít know about you.  In all
fairness, Ethan, Claire was never
convinced her charms would work with you.
But I was supremely confident - having
tastes the goods.  ""Thou shall not covet
thy Neighbourís wife"", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan
is in love with you, Claire, make no
mistake about it.  And like all the
worldís lovers, heís tortured by the
same, one pathetic question - ""does she
feel the same way I do?"""
643,PHELPS,643,"Well Claire do you?  Have you been
exploiting his feelings or returning
them?"
644,CLAIRE,644,"Jim - lets just get the money and get out
of here."
645,CLAIRE (CONT'D),645,The money Ethan.
646,ETHAN,646,Youíve earned it.
647,PHELPS,647,Count it.
648,ETHAN,648,"Tell me something Claire, that night in
Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up
the car and scattered Hannah all over
town?"
649,PHELPS,649,Keep counting Claire.
650,CLAIRE,650,It was me.  I did it.
651,PHELPS,651,Satisfied?
652,CLAIRE,652,All ten million.
653,PHELPS,653,Fold it.  Fold it tight.
654,ETHAN,654,"Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten
million is better than six."
655,PHELPS,655,"Donít flatter yourself - six was for
Eastern Europe
.  You made a lousy deal -
ten for the world?  What is that?  But I
needed you for the transfer with Max.  I
got a little extra change;  and you got a
little extra too."
656,PHELPS,656,Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
657,ETHAN,657,"Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not
the only one whoís seen you alive."
658,KITTRIDGE,658,"Good morning, Mr Phelps."
659,PHELPS,659,You son of a bitch.
660,CLAIRE,660,Donít Jim.
661,PHELPS,661,"Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You
like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?"
662,CLAIRE,662,Yes.
663,ETHAN,663,"Jim, itís over."
664,PHELPS,664,"Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing
can be more dangerous than the truth.  It
can kill you."
665,ETHAN,665,Claire...Hey...
666,CLAIRE,666,This stuff is so sticky.
667,ETHAN,667,Claire.
668,CLAIRE,668,"Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me
back...wonít you..."
669,ETHAN,669,"I always have, Claire.."
670,ETHAN,670,"helicopter
approaches."
671,ETHAN,671,CONNECTION TERMINATED.
672,MAX,672,Damn!
673,CONDUCTOR,673,"No, no, it's
IN
the tunnel!"
674,VOICE (O.S.),674,Stop the train!
675,CONDUCTOR,675,"It'll crash into us!  Accelerate,
accelerate."
676,CONDUCTOR,676,They're dangling from either side of it
677,CONDUCTOR,677,a red and green piece of bubble gum
678,ETHAN,678,"Red light, green light.  Asta Lasagna
mother fucker."
679,LUTHER,679,I think this is what you're looking for.
680,MAX,680,"My lawyers will have a field day with
this.  Entrapment, jurisdictional
conflicts --"
681,KITTRIDGE,681,"Maybe we'll just keep the courts out of
this one."
682,MAX,682,"I'm sure we can find something I have
that you need."
683,KITTRIDGE,683,"You know, I would
love
to try."
684,LUTHER,684,Reach your folks?
685,LUTHER,685,How they feeling?
686,ETHAN,686,About what?
687,LUTHER,687,"The official apology from the Justice
Department, the VIP treatment, you know,
the whole nine yards."
688,ETHAN,688,"Well my Mother was a little confused
about how the DEA could mistake her and
Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida keys."
689,LUTHER,689,Cheers.
690,ETHAN,690,"Here's to  you, Luther. (clink glasses)  To
being off the disavowed list."
691,LUTHER,691,"Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!"
692,ETHAN,692,"You're more than that, Luther.  They were
mistaken about you and they're trying to
show you they know it.  They want you
back in."
693,LUTHER,693,"Sure.  They want me back in so I won't
break in!  They
still
can't figure out
how we did it."
694,ETHAN,694,You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
695,LUTHER,695,"I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back
pay, give me a promotion, check out my
office at Langley and
then
, maybe, talk
about it."
696,ETHAN,696,"It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?"
697,LUTHER,697,Why don't you come back with me?
698,ETHAN,698,Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
699,LUTHER,699,"You really liked Phelps, didn't you?"
700,ETHAN,700,"He was a good guy for a long, long time.
Just - not long enough. (looks up) Gotta
catch my flight..(rising)
So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen
again?"
701,LUTHER,701,"Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss
being disreputable."
702,ETHAN,702,"Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any
better I'll always think of you that way."
703,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,703,"Would you like to watch a movie, Miss
Clarke?"
704,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,704,"Excuse me, Mr. Hunt.  Would you like to
watch a movie."
705,ETHAN,705,"No, thank you."
706,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,706,"Would you consider the cinema of the
Caribbean?"
707,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,707,"Aruba, perhaps?"
