0,BARRANCA,0,They're talking about the Curse again!
1,INDY,1,No.
2,INDY,2,We don't need them.
3,BARRANCA,3,I do not carry supplies.
4,INDY,4,"We'll leave them. Once we've got it,
we'll be able to reach the plane by
dusk."
5,SATIPO,5,"The Hovitos are near. The poison is
still fresh... three days. They're
following us, I tell you."
6,INDY,6,"If they knew we were here, they would
have killed us already."
7,INDY,7,"So this is where Forrestal cashed
in."
8,SATIPO,8,A friend of yours?
9,INDY,9,"Competitor. He was good, very good."
10,BARRANCA,10,"No one has ever come out of there
alive. Why should we put our faith
in you?"
11,INDY,11,"No one ever had what we have...
partners."
12,INDY,12,"Assuming that pillar there marks the
corner and..."
13,SATIPO,13,I knew nothing! He was crazy! Please!
14,INDY,14,Let's go.
15,SATIPO,15,What's wrong? Are you lost?
16,INDY,16,Forrestal.
17,SATIPO,17,We can go no further.
18,INDY,18,"Now, Satipo, we don't want to be
discouraged by every little thing."
19,INDY,19,Let me see that.
20,INDY,20,Try not to touch the vines.
21,SATIPO,21,"Señor, I think we are very close."
22,SATIPO,22,"Let us hurry. There is nothing to
fear here."
23,INDY,23,That's what scares me.
24,SATIPO,24,"There's plenty of light, amigo."
25,SATIPO,25,From that hole!
26,INDY,26,You wait here.
27,SATIPO,27,"If you insist, señor."
28,SATIPO,28,"No time to argue. Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip."
29,SATIPO,29,You have no choice! Hurry!
30,SATIPO,30,"Adios, amigo!"
31,INDY,31,Adios.
32,BELLOQ,32,"Dr. Jones, you choose the wrong
friends. This time it will cost you."
33,BELLOQ,33,And you thought I'd given up.
34,INDY,34,"Too bad they don't know you like I
do, Belloq."
35,BELLOQ,35,"Yes, too bad. You could warn them...
if only you spoke Hovitos."
36,BELLOQ,36,Kill him!
37,INDY,37,Get it going! Get it going!
38,INDY,38,GO!
39,JOCK,39,"Don't mind him. That's Reggie.
Wouldn't hurt a soul."
40,INDY,40,I can't stand snakes.
41,JOCK,41,"The world's full of them, you know."
42,INDY,42,I hate them.
43,JOCK,43,"Come on now, Sport, show a little of
the old backbone."
44,BRODY,44,"Do you think the idol will ever show
up?"
45,INDY,45,"I don't know. Just because Belloq
had it doesn't mean he kept it."
46,INDY,46,"Getting it away from those Indians
would be a neat trick"
47,INDY,47,I hope they got him.
48,TEACHING ASSISTANT,48,"I couldn't get the McNabe, Professor.
Someone's got it checked out 'til
next month when classes start."
49,INDY,49,"That's all right, Phil. Thanks a
lot."
50,TEACHING ASSISTANT,50,Will there be anything else?
51,INDY,51,No. I'll see you Thursday.
52,INDY,52,"Hey, if you don't like them, I can
always return them."
53,BRODY,53,"No, they're beautiful. The Museum
will buy them as usual. No questions
asked."
54,INDY,54,Then what's wrong?
55,BRODY,55,I brought along some people today.
56,INDY,56,What kind of people?
57,BRODY,57,Government.
58,INDY,58,Government?
59,BRODY,59,"Don't worry, it's not about your
business."
60,BRODY,60,They're from the Army.
61,INDY,61,I've already served.
62,BRODY,62,"Army Intelligence. They're looking
for Abner."
63,MUSGROVE,63,"But you did study under Professor
Ravenwood at the University of
Chicago?"
64,INDY,64,"We haven't spoken in ten years. I'm
afraid we had a bit of a falling
out."
65,EATON,65,You know nothing of his whereabouts?
66,INDY,66,"Just rumors. Somewhere in Asia, last
I heard."
67,EATON,67,"Maybe Dr. Jones can make sense of
it."
68,MUSGROVE,68,"Well... you must understand, Dr.
Jones, this is all strictly
confidential."
69,INDY,69,I understand.
70,MUSGROVE,70,"Yesterday, one of our European
sections intercepted a Nazi communiqué
from Cairo to Berlin. We don't quite
know what to make of it."
71,MUSGROVE,71,"Here it is - ""Tanis development
proceeding. Acquire headpiece, Staff
of Ra, General Tengtu Hok, Shanghai.
Locate Abner Ravenwood, U.S."""
72,BRODY,72,"Tanis. They must have discovered the
lost ruins."
73,INDY,73,Tanis. Ain't that somethin'!
74,EATON,74,"Frankly, we're a little suspicious...
An American being mentioned so
prominently in a secret Nazi cable."
75,INDY,75,"Ah, Ravenwood's no Nazi."
76,EATON,76,Then what do they want him for?
77,INDY,77,"They're looking for the headpiece to
the Staff of Ra."
78,MUSGROVE,78,But it says here that's in China.
79,INDY,79,"Only half of it. Ravenwood had the
other half."
80,EATON,80,"What would the Nazis want with this -
this Staff of Ra?"
81,BRODY,81,"I can tell you that. Over the last
two years the Nazis have had teams
of archeologists running around the
world looking for all kinds of
religious artifacts."
82,MUSGROVE,82,"That's right. Hitler's a nut on the
subject. Crazy. He's obsessed with
the occult."
83,EATON,83,"What is this Staff of Ra, anyway?"
84,INDY,84,"It all has to do with the Ark of the
Covenant."
85,INDY,85,"The chest the Hebrews used to carry
around the Ten Commandments."
86,INDY,86,"An Egyptian pharaoh stole the Ark
from Jerusalem and took it back to
the city of Tanis. A short time later,
Tanis was consumed by the desert in
a sandstorm that lasted a year. But
before that, the Pharaoh had had the
Ark hidden away in a secret chamber
called the Well of the Souls. Which
is where the Staff of Ra comes in."
87,INDY,87,"Now this was rather clever. The Staff
was really just a big stick - oh, I
don't know, say like this -"
88,INDY,88,"no one really knows for sure. Any
way, it was capped by an elaborate
headpiece with a carving of the sun
at the top. What you had to do was
take the Staff to a special map room
in Tanis - it had the whole city
laid out in miniature on the floor.
When you placed the Staff in a certain
spot in this room, at a certain time
of day, the sun would shine through
a hole here in the headpiece and
then send a beam of light down here -
to the map - giving you the location
of the Well of the Souls..."
89,MUSGROVE,89,"...where the Ark of the Covenant was
kept."
90,INDY,90,"Which is probably what the Nazis are
after."
91,EATON,91,What's this Ark look like?
92,INDY,92,"Look like? Why, it's right here..."
93,EATON,93,Good God!
94,INDY,94,Yes. That's what the Hebrews thought.
95,MUSGROVE,95,"What's that supposed to be coming
out of there?"
96,INDY,96,"Who knows... lightning... fire...
the power of God."
97,EATON,97,"I'm beginning to understand Hitler's
interest in this thing."
98,INDY,98,"Oh yes. The Bible tells of it leveling
mountains and wasting entire regions.
Moses promised that when the Ark was
with you, ""your enemies will be
scattered and your foes fell before
you""."
99,INDY,99,"An army which carries the Ark before
it is invincible."
100,INDY,100,"Oh, there's one other thing that
Hitler undoubtably believes about
the Ark..."
101,INDY,101,"It's said that the Lost Ark will be
recovered at the time of the coming
of the True Messiah."
102,MUSGROVE,102,"Dr. Jones, you've been very helpful.
I hope we can call on you again if
we have questions."
103,INDY,103,Most certainly.
104,BRODY,104,I've got to talk to you.
105,INDY,105,This isn't really a good time.
106,BRODY,106,"Indy, it's important."
107,INDY,107,All right. Come on in.
108,INDY,108,I'll be in a minute.
109,BRODY,109,"They want you to go for it. And
they'll pay."
110,INDY,110,"Good work, Marcus. I had a feeling
this would happen. And, of course,
the Museum gets the Ark when we're
done."
111,BRODY,111,Of course.
112,INDY,112,"Okay, here's the way it's gonna be.
First, I'll high-tail it to Shanghai
and get the piece from General Hok.
Then I think I know where I can find
Ravenwood. If only I can get -"
113,BRODY,113,"General Hok's a tough customer. They
don't call him the Wild Boar for
nothing. And he's tied in with the
Japanese."
114,INDY,114,"I'll worry about that when the time
comes. My only hope is to find the
Well of the Souls before the Nazis
do."
115,KEHOE,115,"Buzz Kehoe, Army Intelligence. You've
met Bang Chow."
116,INDY,116,What's the hurry?
117,KEHOE,117,"Some German agents got here two hours
ago. Luckily, Bang was able to have
them detained at Customs. We'll have
to hurry."
118,KEHOE,118,Jesus! Are you all right!
119,INDY,119,Great. Got it.
120,KEHOE,120,What now?
121,INDY,121,I've got to get to Nepal.
122,SHERPA,122,Gmoiska! Shurga rintoik!
123,CLIMBER,123,Aye! That'll be your last word.
124,MARION,124,"That does it! I've been patient with
you no-goods long enough. I'm not
open at 2 o'clock for myself, you
know. It's all for you. And how do
you repay me: Trouble and noise and
blood on my floor! I won't have it.
Everybody out! Out! Out! We're closed.
Closed! Do your killing outside! And
don't leave any bodies on the porch!"
125,MARION,125,"Hey you, deaf one! I said out of my
place. I don't mean next Easter, I
mean now -"
126,INDY,126,"Hello, Marion."
127,INDY,127,"Nice to see you, too."
128,MARION,128,Get up and get out.
129,INDY,129,"Take it easy. I'm looking for your
father."
130,MARION,130,Well you're two years too late.
131,MARION,131,"Go home, Mahdlo. I'll see you
tomorrow."
132,INDY,132,What happened?
133,MARION,133,"Avalanche. Up there. He was digging.
What else? He spent his whole life
digging. Dragging me all over this
rotten earth. For what?"
134,INDY,134,Do you find him?
135,MARION,135,"Hell no. He's buried where he was
working. Probably preserved real
good, too. In the snow."
136,INDY,136,"Not a bad way to go. Doing what he
loved."
137,MARION,137,"Don't give me that stuff! What do
you know?"
138,MARION,138,"I'm the one that was left in a bad
way. He didn't have a penny. Guess
how I lived, Mister Jones. I worked
here. And I wasn't the bartender."
139,MARION,139,"Finally the guy that owned the joint
went crazy. Snow crazy. They took
his away screaming. As they dragged
him out, he said the place was all
mine for life."
140,MARION,140,Can you imagine a more evil curse?
141,MARION,141,"So far, it's working."
142,INDY,142,Why not leave? Go back to the States.
143,MARION,143,"I'll go back. I'll get there. Not
that there's a soul there who knows
my name or cares. But I'll go. And
when I do, they'll know me. 'Cause
I'm going to go back in style. With
money. A goddamn lady!"
144,INDY,144,Where you gonna get it?
145,MARION,145,"If I knew that, you think I'd still
be running this dive?"
146,MARION,146,"I'll tell you something Indy. I've
learned to hate you in the last ten
years. But somehow, no matter how
much I hated you, I always knew that
someday you'd come through that door.
I never doubted that. Something made
is inevitable."
147,MARION,147,Why are you here... now... tonight?
148,INDY,148,"I need one of the pieces your father
collected."
149,MARION,149,"You son-of-a-bitch! You know what
you did to me, to my life? This is
your handiwork."
150,INDY,150,I never meant to hurt you.
151,MARION,151,I was a child!
152,INDY,152,You knew what you were doing.
153,MARION,153,I was in love.
154,INDY,154,"I guess that depends on your
definition."
155,MARION,155,It was wrong. You knew it.
156,INDY,156,"Look, I did what I did. I don't expect
you to be happy about it. But maybe
we can do each other some good."
157,MARION,157,Why start now?
158,INDY,158,"Shut up and listen for a second. I
want that piece your father had.
I've got money."
159,MARION,159,How much?
160,INDY,160,"Enough to get you back to the States.
Where are his things?"
161,MARION,161,"Gone. I sold it all. It was all junk.
The junk he wasted his life on."
162,INDY,162,Everything?
163,INDY,163,That's too bad.
164,MARION,164,"You look disappointed. I like that.
How's it feel?"
165,MARION,165,What are you drinking?
166,INDY,166,Seltzer.
167,MARION,167,"Real man's drink. Me, I like scotch.
And I like bourbon. And vodka and
gin. I'm not much for brandy. I'm
off that."
168,INDY,168,"You're a tough broad now, aren't
you?"
169,MARION,169,"It's no act, pal. This ain't
Schenectady."
170,INDY,170,"I can only say I'm sorry so many
times."
171,MARION,171,"You really have money? You don't
look rich."
172,MARION,172,"I may be able to locate some of his
things. I know who's got them. What
do you want?"
173,INDY,173,"A bronze piece, about this size. In
the shape of the sun. Probably broken
off at the bottom. Has a little hole
in it, off-center. Does that sound
familiar?"
174,INDY,174,Do you know where it is?
175,MARION,175,Maybe. How much?
176,INDY,176,Three thousand. American.
177,MARION,177,"That'll get me back, but not in style.
This doodad must be pretty important."
178,INDY,178,Maybe.
179,MARION,179,"I knew it would happen eventually. I
knew it. Something had to go my way."
180,MARION,180,"I've got to think this out. I'm used
to bargaining with yaks."
181,INDY,181,"Okay, five thousand. That's all I
can give you now. I can get you more
when you land in the States."
182,MARION,182,"You word, huh?"
183,MARION,183,"Just like you said you'd be back
last time? That was your word too."
184,INDY,184,"I'm back, aren't I?"
185,INDY,185,You can trust me.
186,MARION,186,Come back tomorrow.
187,INDY,187,Why?
188,MARION,188,"Because I said so, that's why. It's
about time I called the shots in
this relationship."
189,MARION,189,"Wait a minute. Leave the five thousand
here."
190,MARION,190,"You want trust, give some. I want to
smell your money."
191,INDY,191,I trust you.
192,MARION,192,You're an idiot.
193,INDY,193,I've heard that.
194,MARION,194,Hold it. Come here.
195,INDY,195,"Bossy, aren't you?"
196,MARION,196,That's right. Give me a kiss.
197,MARION,197,Get out of my place.
198,INDY,198,Tomorrow.
199,BELZIG,199,"Good evening, Fraulein."
200,MARION,200,The bar's closed.
201,BELZIG,201,We are not thirsty.
202,MARION,202,What do you want?
203,BELZIG,203,"The same thing your friend Dr. Jones
wanted. Surely he told you there
would be other interested parties."
204,BELZIG,204,"Ah, the man is nefarious. I hope for
your sake he has not yet acquired
it."
205,MARION,205,"Why, are you willing to offer more?"
206,BELZIG,206,"Almost certainly. Do you still have
it?"
207,MARION,207,No. But I know where it is.
208,MARION,208,"How 'bout a drink for you and your
men?"
209,BELZIG,209,"We will stick to the business at
hand, Fraulein."
210,MARION,210,"Fine. Why don't you come back tomorrow
when Jones is here and we'll have an
auction?"
211,BELZIG,211,I'm afraid an auction is not possible.
212,BELZIG,212,"Your fire is dying here, Fraulein."
213,BELZIG,213,"Why don't you tell us where the piece
is right now?"
214,MARION,214,"Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know who
you're used to dealing with, but no
one tells me what to do in my place."
215,BELZIG,215,"Americans! You're all alike. Fraulein
Ravenwood. I'll show you want I'm
used to."
216,MARION,216,Wait! I can be reasonable -
217,BELZIG,217,That time is passed.
218,MARION,218,"You don't need that. I'll tell you
everything!"
219,BELZIG,219,"Yes, I know you will."
220,INDY,220,Hello.
221,BELZIG,221,Shoot them both!
222,SECOND NAZI,222,He's our man!
223,BELZIG,223,Do as I say!
224,MARION,224,Unbelievable!
225,INDY,225,Let's get out of here!
226,MARION,226,Not without that piece you want!
227,INDY,227,It's here?
228,INDY,228,"Forget it! I want you out of here.
Now!"
229,MARION,229,There!
230,INDY,230,Let's go!
231,MARION,231,You burned down my place!
232,INDY,232,I owe you plenty!
233,MARION,233,You owe me plenty!
234,INDY,234,You're something!
235,MARION,235,"I am something. And I'll tell you
exactly what -"
236,MARION,236,I'm your partner!
237,FAYAH,237,Silence!
238,FAYAH,238,Why do you forget yourselves?
239,FAYAH,239,"What is this? Who brought this animal
in?"
240,MARION,240,"Why, thank you. I like you too."
241,FAYAH,241,Then it shall be welcome in our house.
242,MARION,242,"Oh, no! You don't have to have it
around if you don't want it -"
243,SALLAH,243,"All of Allah's creatures are welcome
here. You please us by letting us
please you."
244,INDY,244,"I knew the Germans would hire you,
Sallah. They couldn't have an
excavation in the desert without the
best digger in Egypt."
245,SALLAH,245,"All Arabs look alike to them, Indy."
246,INDY,246,Tell me about the map room at Tanis.
247,SALLAH,247,"We found it three days ago. I broke
through myself."
248,INDY,248,Those Nazis are moving awfully fast.
249,SALLAH,249,The Frenchman is helping them.
250,INDY,250,"Belloq. So he got away from the
Indians. This is going to be more
interesting that I thought."
251,SALLAH,251,"I'm afraid this has put the Germans
close to finding the Well of the
Souls."
252,INDY,252,"Even Belloq won't be able to find it
without that. Can you make anything
of those markings? They're nothing
I'm familiar with."
253,SALLAH,253,"But I know someone who might. You
can go to see him tomorrow."
254,SALLAH,254,Indy... something bothers me.
255,INDY,255,"What is it, my friend?"
256,SALLAH,256,"It is the Ark. If it is there, at
Tanis... It is not something man was
meant to disturb... Death has always
surrounded it. It is not of this
earth."
257,INDY,257,Do you really need that monkey?
258,MARION,258,"I'm surprised at you, Indy. Talking
that way about our baby. He's got
your looks, too."
259,INDY,259,And your brains.
260,MARION,260,Hey! Hey!... where're you going?
261,INDY,261,He'll be OK. Come on. Come on.
262,INDY,262,Run! Get out of here!
263,INDY,263,"Go, dammit! Go!"
264,MARION,264,Indy-y-y-y!
265,INDY,265,Marion.
266,ARAB BARTENDER,266,"The gentleman in the corner sent it.
He would like you to join him."
267,INDY,267,Too bad. I'm drinking alone.
268,INDY,268,Belloq.
269,BELLOQ,269,"Good evening, Dr. Jones."
270,INDY,270,I ought to kill you right now.
271,BELLOQ,271,"It was not I who brought the girl
into this dirty business."
272,BELLOQ,272,"Sit down, please, before you fall
down. We can behave as civilized
people. I'm afraid it will be your
last opportunity."
273,INDY,273,Not a very private place for a murder.
274,BELLOQ,274,"These Arabs will not interfere in
the white man's business. They do
not care if we kill each other off."
275,BELLOQ,275,"Terribly difficult finding a decent
vintage here. You were quite vigorous
in Shanghai. Unfortunately, our friend
the Wild Boar had taken the precaution
of making several copies of the piece."
276,BELLOQ,276,"How odd that is should end this way
for us, after so many... stimulating
encounters. I almost regret it. Where
shall I find a new adversary so close
to my own level?"
277,INDY,277,Try the local sewer.
278,BELLOQ,278,"I know you despise me. We always
hate in others that which we most
fear in ourselves. And you and I are
very much alike."
279,INDY,279,Now you're getting nasty.
280,BELLOQ,280,"We have always done the same kind of
work. Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend. I am a shadowy
reflection of you. But it would have
taken only a nudge to make you the
same as me, to push you out of the
light."
281,BELLOQ,281,"You know it to be true! How nice.
And how ironic the timing."
282,BELLOQ,282,Do you realize what the Ark is?
283,BELLOQ,283,"It's a transmitter. A radio for
talking to God! And now it is within
my grasp."
284,INDY,284,"What about your boss, der Fuhrer? I
thought he was waiting to take
possession."
285,BELLOQ,285,"When the time is right. When I am
finished with it."
286,INDY,286,"I hope your friends are patient.
Dangerous work, Belloq."
287,BELLOQ,287,"Yes. Very. You may consider yourself
fortunate that your involvement
concludes here."
288,INDY,288,"Tell me, did you get away with the
idol?"
289,BELLOQ,289,"I was lucky to get away with my life.
The Hovitos proved quite narrow-minded
about the whole matter."
290,INDY,290,"You know, if it's God you want to
talk to, maybe I can arrange it."
291,BELLOQ,291,"You have not changed. But, please,
do not reach for your weapon until
you are ready to die."
292,LITTLE SON,292,"Uncle Indy, we have been looking for
you."
293,LITTLE DAUGHTER,293,"Come home now, Uncle. Hurry!"
294,INDY,294,"Yes. Yes, I'll come now."
295,BELLOQ,295,"Next time, Indiana Jones, it will
take more than children to save you."
296,SALLAH,296,I thought we would find you there.
297,SALLAH,297,"Better than the United States Marines,
eh?"
298,INDY,298,Thanks you.
299,INDY,299,Marion's dead.
300,SALLAH,300,"Yes, I know. I am sorry."
301,SALLAH,301,"More reason than ever to beat the
bastards."
302,SALLAH,302,"Life goes on, Indy."
303,SALLAH,303,There is the proof.
304,SALLAH,304,"I have much to tell you, Indy."
305,INDY,305,"And they made the calculation in the
map room?"
306,SALLAH,306,"This morning. Belloq and the boss
German, Shliemann. When they came
out of the map room, we were given a
new spot in which to dig... out away
from the camp."
307,INDY,307,The Well of the Souls.
308,AMIR,308,Come. Look.
309,AMIR,309,"This is a warning... not to disturb
the Ark of the Covenant."
310,INDY,310,Just want I need.
311,INDY,311,"How 'bout the height of the staff?
Did Belloq get it off of there?"
312,AMIR,312,Yes... it is here.
313,AMIR,313,It says it is... ten jamirs high...
314,SALLAH,314,About seventy-five inches.
315,AMIR,315,Wait! I am not finished...
316,AMIR,316,"""And one jamir to honor the Hebrew
God whose Ark this is."""
317,INDY,317,"You said their top section was blank.
Are you absolutely sure?"
318,INDY,318,"Belloq's staff is seven and a half
inches short. They're digging in the
wrong spot!"
319,SALLAH,319,"A home run, my friend, grand slam!"
320,SALLAH,320,"We have a saying - ""A little luck is
better than much smartness."" Indy,
pardner, you are very lucky fellow."
321,SALLAH,321,Bad dates.
322,INDY,322,My God! They aren't kidding!
323,SALLAH,323,There! That is the map room!
324,INDY,324,What time does the sun hit the map?
325,SALLAH,325,Just after eight.
326,INDY,326,"We haven't got much time. Where are
the Germans digging for the Well of
the Souls?"
327,INDY,327,Okay. Let's go.
328,JEEP GERMAN (O.S.),328,"Hey! You, the skinny one!"
329,JEEP GERMAN,329,"Yes, you. What are you doing there?"
330,JEEP GERMAN,330,"Well bring that rope over here, you
cur."
331,HUNGRY GERMAN (O.S.),331,Bring us some of that!
332,HUNGRY GERMAN,332,"Now, idiot!"
333,HUNGRY GERMAN,333,Water. Bring us water.
334,INDY,334,Sallah.
335,INDY,335,Sallah!
336,INDY,336,Sallah!
337,HUNGRY GERMAN (O.S.),337,"Hey, you! More water over here!"
338,HUNGRY GERMAN,338,"Why aren't you at the digs? Come
here!"
339,HUNGRY GERMAN,339,"No, dummkopf, I said come!"
340,INDY,340,I though you were dead.
341,MARION,341,"They were throwing me around like a
rag doll."
342,INDY,342,"They must have switched baskets.
Thank god for that! Bless those
bastards. Have they hurt you?"
343,MARION,343,"No. Not since I got here. They just
asked about you - what you knew. The
Frenchman's got the hot's for me.
I've been playing that along. Oh,
Indy, get me out of here."
344,MARION,344,What's wrong?
345,INDY,345,"I have to leave you here for a little
while. I know where the Ark is. If I
take you out of here they'll start
combing the place for us."
346,MARION,346,Cut me loose!
347,INDY,347,Keep your voice down.
348,MARION,348,I said get me out of -
349,INDY,349,"Look, you don't know how glad I am
to see you. And I don't like doing
this. But the whole thing will be
shot if you don't just sit here
quietly. They haven't hurt you in
the last twenty-four hours, they
aren't going to start now. I'll be
back to get you in no time."
350,INDY,350,There!
351,BELLOQ,351,"I cautioned you about being premature
with that communiqué to Berlin.
Archeology is not an exact science.
If does not adhere to time schedules."
352,SHLIEMANN,352,"The Fuhrer is not a patient man. He
demands constant reports and he
expects progress. You led me to
believe -"
353,BELLOQ,353,"Nothing. I have made no promises. I
said only that it looked very
favorable. Perhaps the Ark will still
be found in an adjoining chamber.
Based on the information in our
possession, my calculations were
correct. Perhaps some bit of evidence
still eludes us. Perhaps"
354,GOBLER,354,Perhaps the girl can help us.
355,SHLIEMANN,355,"My feeling exactly. She was in
possession of the original piece for
years. She may know much."
356,SHLIEMANN,356,If properly motivated...
357,BELLOQ,357,"I tell you, she knows nothing useful."
358,SHLIEMANN,358,"I'm surprised to find you squeamish.
That is not your reputation. But it
needn't concern you. I have the
perfect man for this kind of work."
359,INDY,359,"The Ark must be in that stone case.
What's that gray stuff all over the
floor -"
360,INDY,360,"Why snakes? Why did it have to be
snakes? Anything else."
361,SALLAH,361,Asps. Very dangerous.
362,INDY,362,"Lots of torches. And oil. I want a
landing strip down there."
363,BELLOQ,363,"Believe me, you made a mistake. If
you would just give me something to
placate them. Some bit of information."
364,MARION,364,"I swear to you, I know nothing more.
I have no loyalty to Jones. He's
brought me only trouble."
365,BELLOQ,365,I cannot control them.
366,BELZIG,366,"We meet again, Fraulein."
367,INDY,367,Don't touch it! Never touch it!
368,INDY,368,"Hurry up! Why did it have to be
snakes?"
369,INDY,369,What the -
370,BELLOQ,370,"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you
doing in such a nasty place?"
371,INDY,371,"Why don't you fellows come down here?
I'll show you."
372,BELLOQ,372,"No thank you, my friend."
373,BELLOQ,373,"I think we are all very comfortable
up here."
374,BELLOQ,374,"After all these years, it is most
considerate of you to aid me in this
way."
375,SHLIEMANN,375,"I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr.
Jones. Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
But I do not wish to leave you down
in that awful place..."
376,SHLIEMANN,376,...all alone.
377,MARION,377,Don't put me down!
378,BELLOQ,378,The girl was mine!
379,SHLIEMANN,379,"She is of no use to us. Only our
mission for the Fuhrer matters."
380,SHLIEMANN,380,"I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you
have that clearly in mind."
381,BELLOQ,381,"Goodbye, mademoiselle."
382,BELLOQ,382,Indiana Jones... adieu!
383,INDY,383,"Don't panic. There's plenty of time
for that later. Wave that at anything
that slithers."
384,MARION,384,What are you doing?
385,INDY,385,Just watch the floor.
386,MARION,386,"Whatever you're doing, do it faster."
387,INDY,387,There!
388,INDY,388,Come on!
389,INDY,389,Stay here!
390,MARION,390,Where are you going?
391,INDY,391,"I'll be back in a minute. We're going
through this wall."
392,INDY,392,"Just keep your eyes open and get
ready to run. No matter what happens
to me."
393,MARION,393,What do you mean?
394,MARION (O.S.),394,Where are you?!
395,MARION,395,Indy! Where are you?! Please Lord!
396,INDY,396,Come on!
397,MARION,397,The snakes... are they here?
398,INDY,398,I guess not. I think I'd be dead.
399,MARION,399,Do you know where you're going?
400,INDY,400,Absolutely.
401,MARION,401,Thank god. Where?
402,INDY,402,Out.
403,INDY,403,Don't do that. It scares me.
404,INDY,404,Look!
405,GOBLER,405,"Get is gassed immediately! It has an
important cargo to take out!"
406,INDY,406,"When the Ark gets loaded, we're
already going to be on that plane."
407,INDY,407,Get out! Get out!
408,SHLIEMANN,408,Stay with the Ark!
409,SHLIEMANN,409,Sabotage!
410,BELLOQ,410,"We must get the Ark away from this
place immediately!"
411,SHLIEMANN,411,"Have it put on the truck. We'll fly
out of Cairo."
412,SHLIEMANN,412,And Gobler -
413,SHLIEMANN,413,I want plenty of protection.
414,SALLAH,414,"Holy smoke, my friends! I am so
pleased you are not dead."
415,MARION,415,Us too.
416,SALLAH,416,"The Ark! They're taking it on a truck
to Cairo."
417,INDY,417,Where is it?
418,INDY,418,"You two get back to Cairo quick and
get us transportation to England - a
plane, a ship, anything."
419,MARION,419,What about you?
420,INDY,420,"I'm going to get that truck. I'll
meet you at Omar's. Be ready for me."
421,MARION,421,How are you going to get that truck?
422,INDY,422,"I don't know. I'm making this up as
I go."
423,SHLIEMANN,423,"If anything happens to that Ark,
we're all dead men ! The Fuhrer will
see to it!"
424,MARION,424,"I have a feeling I'm not the first
woman to travel with these pirates.
There's a whole wardrobe in there."
425,INDY,425,It's lovely.
426,MARION,426,I feel like a virgin bride in this.
427,INDY,427,That's what you look like.
428,MARION,428,"There are some things you can
recapture in this life, but that
isn't one of them."
429,INDY,429,What would you like to recapture?
430,MARION,430,Nothing. That is the way it is.
431,INDY,431,"Did I ever say I was sorry I burned
down your tavern?"
432,MARION,432,"No. Then again, I burned up that
plane."
433,INDY,433,You saved my life.
434,MARION,434,And you saved mine.
435,INDY,435,"Seems things have worked out kind of
even."
436,MARION,436,That's the way I like them.
437,INDY,437,"Maybe we should consider all past
accounts closed."
438,MARION,438,No. Not yet.
439,INDY,439,What else?
440,MARION,440,What is it?
441,INDY,441,The engines have shut down.
442,MARION,442,Why?
443,INDY,443,I'm going to find out.
444,MESSENGER PIRATE,444,Mister Jones! The Captain he say -
445,INDY,445,What's wrong?
446,KATANGA,446,You have most important friends.
447,INDY,447,Holy shit.
448,KATANGA,448,"I sent my man for you. You and the
girl must disappear. We have a place
in the hold. Go, my friend!"
449,SHLIEMANN,449,Take it aboard the Wurrfler!
450,BELLOQ,450,And be very careful!
451,SHLIEMANN,451,What about Jones?
452,SERGEANT,452,"Not a trace yet, sir!"
453,KATANGA,453,Jones is dead.
454,KATANGA,454,"We killed him. He was of no use to
us. The girl, however, has certain
value where we are headed. She will
bring a very good price. If that
cargo you have taken was your goal,
then go in peace with it. But leave
us the girl. It will reduce our loss
on this trip."
455,SHLIEMANN,455,"Savage. You are not in a position to
ask for anything. We will take what
we wish and then decide whether or
not to blow your ship from the water."
456,BELLOQ,456,"That girl goes with me. It will be
part of my compensation. I'm sure
the Fuhrer would approve."
457,BELLOQ,457,"If she fails to please me, you can
do with her as you wish."
458,THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN,458,"Colonel Shliemann, all torpedoes are
loaded."
459,SHLIEMANN,459,"What do you think, Captain?"
460,THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN,460,"I think not, Colonel. Nothing is to
be gained. We are not at war."
461,SHLIEMANN,461,"...yet. Let the vermin live. We must
be on our way."
462,INDY,462,Damn!
463,TALL CAPTAIN,463,"The tents have been arranged in
accordance with your radioed
instructions, sir."
464,BELLOQ,464,"Good. We must take the Ark there
now."
465,SHLIEMANN,465,"I am uncomfortable with the thought
of this -"
466,SHLIEMANN,466,"Jewish ritual. Are you sure it's
necessary?"
467,BELLOQ,467,"Let me ask you this - Would you be
more comfortable opening the Ark in
Berlin - for the Fuhrer - and finding
out only then if the sacred pieces
of the Covenant are inside? Knowing,
only then, whether you have
accomplished your mission and obtained
the one, true Ark?"
468,INDY,468,Hold it.
469,INDY,469,"One move from anybody and I blow
that box back to Moses."
470,BELLOQ,470,"Jones, your persistence surprises
even me. You are going to give
mercenaries a bad name."
471,INDY,471,What about you? Talked to God yet?
472,INDY,472,Where's the girl?
473,SHLIEMANN,473,"Doctor Jones, surely you don't think
you can escape from this base."
474,INDY,474,"That depends on how reasonable we're
all willing to be. All I want is the
girl. We'll keep possession of the
Ark only till we've got safe transport
to England. Then it's all yours."
475,SHLIEMANN,475,If we refuse?
476,INDY,476,"Then the Ark and some of us are going
up in a big bang. I don't think Hitler
would like that a bit. Now I don't
want to talk about this anymore.
Show me that girl in five seconds or -"
477,SHLIEMANN,477,"Jones, this is the second time I
have seen you looking very foolish."
478,INDY,478,"It's a bad habit. I'm trying to break
it."
479,SHLIEMANN,479,"I'll help you. This time I'll kill
you myself."
480,BELLOQ,480,"No! Not in the presence of the Ark!
Take him outside."
481,BELLOQ,481,"Indiana Jones, I salute you. I am
even a little sorry you will miss
this moment."
482,INDY,482,"Thanks. If you talk to Him, tell Him
I'm on my way up."
483,INDY,483,"Marion! Marion, can you hear me?"
484,INDY,484,Hi.
485,MARION,485,"Oh, Indy! Thank god you're here."
486,INDY,486,Glad I could make it.
487,INDY,487,Let's get out of here.
488,MARION,488,What about the Ark?
489,INDY,489,Are you game?
490,MARION,490,Hell yes! We've made it this far.
491,INDY,491,Okay. Let's do it.
492,INDY,492,"Whatever you do, don't touch it.
Let's put it on the floor."
493,INDY,493,"We'll go down that side. Shoot anyone
who looks at us crosseyed."
494,SHLIEMANN,494,Stop them! Kill them!
495,INDY,495,Get down!
496,OFFICER,496,"We must cover the drums! Protect
them from the bullets!"
497,MARION,497,Slow it down!
498,MUSGROVE,498,"You've done your country a great
service."
499,EATON,499,"And we trust you found the settlement
satisfactory?"
500,MARION,500,Quite.
501,EATON,501,"Good, good."
502,EATON,502,Then I guess that about does it.
503,BRODY,503,When can we have the Ark?
504,EATON,504,"I thought we answered that. It's
someplace very safe -"
505,INDY,505,"That's a powerful force. Research
should be done -"
506,EATON,506,"Oh, it will be, Dr. Jones, I assure
you. We have top men working on it
right now."
507,INDY,507,Who?
508,EATON,508,Top men.
509,INDY,509,We may be able to help.
510,EATON,510,"We appreciate that. And we won't
hesitate to call on you."
511,MUSGROVE,511,Thank you all. Thank you again.
512,MARION,512,"Well they aren't going to tell you,
so why don't you just forget it. I'd
think you'd had enough of that damn
Ark. Just put your mind on something
else."
513,INDY,513,"Yeah, like what?"
514,INDY,514,"It's not the Ark... but it'll have
to do."
