0,FIRST MAN,0,MacLeod.
1,MOTHER,1,"My, but are you the
picture."
2,CONOR,2,"(surveying himself)
It's a bit tight."
3,FATHER,3,"Ah, Conor, how you look
a man."
4,MOTHER,4,"Have you time for some-
thing to eat?"
5,CONOR,5,"No, Mother.  They'll be
here shortly."
6,FATHER,6,"Your grandfather wore
that in his service to
the King, and I to fight
for the Duke."
7,MOTHER,7,Must he go?
8,FATHER,8,"Aye.  It is his duty.  All
of ours."
9,MOTHER,9,"But Ian, he's still but a boy."
10,FATHER,10,He's a MacLeod.
11,CONOR,11,I'll be fine Mother.
12,CLANSMAN,12,They march.
13,KNIGHT,13,Is the boy among them?
14,CLANSMAN,14,Aye.
15,VASSAL #1,15,Is a bad day for this.
16,VASSAL #2,16,"The Duke has been compro-
mised.  He will have his due."
17,VASSAL #1,17,"By day's end he will have
our heads."
18,VASSAL #2,18,"We ride against the Suther-
lands.  That is all that
matters."
19,VASSAL #1,19,This makes no sense to me.
20,FRIEND,20,"The fog is bad.  We cannot
even see the sides of our
own ranks."
21,FRIEND,21,Is this your first?
22,CONOR,22,Aye.
23,FRIEND,23,It's begun.
24,KNIGHT,24,There can be but one.
25,VASSAL #1,25,Leave him!
26,OFFICER #1,26,Kevin!  Get is a backup.
27,TAUPIN,27,"I was merely walking by
when-"
28,OFFICER #1,28,Don't move.
29,OFFICER #2,29,They're on their way.
30,OFFICER #2,30,Christ.
31,PRIEST,31,"...Libera Domine Animan
servi tui sicut libertasi
David de manu regis Saul..."
32,PRIEST,32,"...In mamus tuas domine
commendo spiritum meum..."
33,VASSAL #1,33,Has the boy died?
34,CLANSMAN,34,"He is having the last rites
now.  It should be over by
morning."
35,VASSAL #1,35,"Never seen anybody cut as
bad live so long.  He should
have died on the field."
36,CLANSMAN,36,"Tonight or tomorrow, it's
all the same."
37,PRIEST,37,"...Auditorium nostrum in
nomine domini..."
38,VASSAL #1,38,This has been a dark day.
39,PRIEST,39,...Requiescant in pace...
40,EXAMINER,40,"Real clean.  No sawing
action at all.  Whatever
it was did it in one
swipe."
41,EXAMINER,41,Like the other one.
42,MORAN,42,What about that?
43,EXAMINER,43,Hasn't any blood on it.
44,MORAN,44,"About the only thing
that doesn't."
45,EXAMINER,45,"I'll give it a closer
look when I get back."
46,OFFICER #3,46,"Come on Brenna, you know
better than that."
47,BRENNA,47,I'm invited.
48,BRENNA,48,Mr. Levine...
49,EXAMINER,49,"Hope this isn't past your
bedtime."
50,BRENNA,50,"Doesn't have a head,
does he?"
51,EXAMINER,51,This one came unassembled.
52,MORAN,52,"Just show her what she came
for, Tom."
53,EXAMINER,53,"Come on, this is more
your line of work."
54,EXAMINER,54,"How's your uncle?  I hardly
ever see him anymore."
55,BRENNA,55,Fine.
56,EXAMINER,56,There you go.
57,EXAMINER,57,"Didn't look like it came from
""Toys-Are-Us"", that's why I
called you."
58,BRENNA,58,"Didn't think it was my
buddy over there."
59,EXAMINER,59,"Figured you knew more about
swords than I did."
60,BRENNA,60,Claymore.
61,EXAMINER,61,Huh?
62,BRENNA,62,"Scottish claymore.  Take
a French epee, add twenty
pounds of ballast so it
means business, and you've
got a claymore."
63,EXAMINER,63,You're the expert.
64,BRENNA,64,It's in good condition.
65,MORAN,65,This your present address?
66,TAUPIN,66,Yes.
67,MORAN,67,"Mr.-
(looks at license)
Taupin, what were you
doing in that alley?"
68,TAUPIN,68,"I was walking by when I
heard a shout.  Your men
came right after."
69,MORAN,69,Did you know the victim?
70,TAUPIN,70,No.
71,MORAN,71,"His name was Iman Fasil
if that jogs your memory."
72,TAUPIN,72,It doesn't.
73,MORAN,73,"He was carrying a Syrian
passport and had been in
the country less than a week."
74,MORAN,74,"Two days ago a Bulgarian
national was murdered the
same way.  He'd also been
in the country less than a
week."
75,(beat),75,What is your citizenship?
76,TAUPIN,76,American.
77,MORAN,77,"Do you make a habit of
hanging out in that neigh-
borhood at night?"
78,TAUPIN,78,What are you getting at?
79,MORAN,79,"Let's just say that in my
years with this department
I've seen more than one well
dressed business man look for
a hand job on 14th Street."
80,MORAN,80,What were _you_ looking for?
81,TAUPIN,81,That's none of your business.
82,MORAN,82,You're wrong.
83,MORAN,83,Do you know what this is?
84,TAUPIN,84,I presume it's a sword.
85,MORAN,85,"A claymore to be exact.  You
wouldn't know anything about
it would you?"
86,TAUPIN,86,Your murder weapon?
87,MORAN,87,"It was covered with Mr.
Fasil's fingerprints, but
none of his blood."
88,TAUPIN,88,A mystery.
89,MORAN,89,For the moment.
90,MORAN,90,"All right Mr. Taupin, we'll be in
touch."
91,MOTHER,91,"Ah Steven, it is good to see you."
92,TRAVELLER,92,"I only just heard of Conor.  I came
up from Catroch as soon as I could."
93,MOTHER,93,You're a kind man to be sure.
94,TRAVELLER,94,"I thought it only proper to pay
me last respects to the family."
95,MOTHER,95,"Steven, Conor didn't die."
96,TRAVELLER,96,"But I had heard his wounds were
mortal."
97,MOTHER,97,"They were Steven, they were.  It's
been a miracle it has.  He lasted
right through and healed.  No one
in the village has ever seen anything
like it.  Ever."
98,CONOR,98,You're pretty today.
99,CONOR,99,"I'm your future husband, remember?"
100,MARA,100,I have no future husband.
101,CONOR,101,"I don't understand.  Not a week
ago your father gave us his blessing."
102,MARA,102,"My future husband died in battle
against the Sutherlands."
103,CONOR,103,"What are you saying?  I'm standing
here as real as you."
104,MARA,104,"You cannot be real, Conor.  You had
the last rites.  No man has been cut
half as bad and lived."
105,CONOR,105,But I did live.
106,MARA,106,"Live?  In less than a week you're
prancing about the country like a
squirrel."
107,CONOR,107,"So why the crazy talk?  It's a
miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has
smiled on me.  On us."
108,MARA,108,Some think not.
109,CONOR,109,Who?
110,MARA,110,"There's rumor in the village.
Some call it magic."
111,CONOR,111,"That's mad.  Surely you don't
take their word?"
112,MARA,112,"I don't know, Conor.  It's not
natural.  Maybe something has
touched you."
113,CONOR,113,"You're sounding like that mad
woman, Widow Baggins."
114,MARA,114,"Me father has taken back my
hand."
115,CONOR,115,"Ah, Lassie..."
116,MARA,116,"Please not be touching me, Conor."
117,CONOR,117,"I'll not take that kind of talk
from you.  From those others
below, maybe.  But not from you."
118,MARA,118,"Leave me alone, Conor.  Please."
119,CONOR,119,"You're not talking sense, Mara!"
120,CONOR,120,I'm sorry.
121,CONOR,121,"If you send me away now, Mara,
I'll not come looking for you."
122,MARA,122,Do what you must.
123,RECEPTIONIST,123,"Mrs. Thompson agreed to settle for
fifteen, Melvin's wants to make a
pick-up at three o'clock, the coffee
machine's broken, and there's a
Miss Cartwright from the Smithsonian
in your office."
124,BRENNA,124,Do you play?
125,TAUPIN,125,Yes.
126,BRENNA,126,Very traditional.
127,TAUPIN,127,"Miss Cartwright, what is it I can
do for you?"
128,BRENNA,128,"I'd like to ask you about the
claymore."
129,TAUPIN,129,It's not mine.
130,BRENNA,130,"It's quite rare you know, some-
thing so common in its time so
well looked after all these years."
131,TAUPIN,131,"Miss Cartwright, unless you have
come here to sell the sword,
there's very little I can help
you with.  Now if you will excuse
me, I have a great deal of work
to do."
132,BRENNA,132,Byzantine?
133,TAUPIN,133,Basil the II.
134,BRENNA,134,"Charming guy, Basil.  Once after
beating an army of Serbians he
blinded all but-"
135,TAUPIN,135,"-All but one out of a hundred, I
know.  All left to be led like
donkeys back home.  Now if you will
please-"
136,BRENNA,136,Good reflexes.
137,TAUPIN,137,"Good day, Miss Cartwright."
138,BRENNA,138,I don't believe him.
139,SUPERVISOR,139,Why?
140,BRENNA,140,"He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I
think he's got something to
do with it."
141,RESEARCHER #1,141,"Oh, has your penetrating research
on 9th Century Lithuanian dildos
suddenly made you an expert on the
criminal mentality?"
142,BRENNA,142,"Screw off, Larry."
143,RESEARCHER #2,143,"The cops bought it.  They let him
go."
144,BRENNA,144,"What could they hold him for?  I
think they're just waiting for
something concrete before they
haul him in for real.  We should
look into it.  He had to have
gotten that sword from somewhere."
145,SUPERVISOR,145,"Hang on a sec, you did your little
favor for the boys downtown, I'm
sure your uncle and the rest are
perfectly capable of taking it
from here."
146,BRENNA,146,"I've seen nobleman swords that
weren't as well preserved.  It's
just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why
would he be carrying it around
in an alley?"
147,RESEARCHER #1,147,"Here we go.  Everytime there's a
murder in town we have to put up
with junior D.A."
148,RESEARCHER #2,148,Must be genetic.
149,BRENNA,149,"Someone should check him out.
Maybe a collection somewhere
got knocked over.  He has one,
he might have two."
150,SUPERVISOR,150,"You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see
the crap piled up on it?"
151,BRENNA,151,"Give it a rest Ned, huh?"
152,RESEARCHER #2,152,"Might be interesting to see what
his family connections are.  That's
a hell of a piece to be just chuck-
ing around in an alley."
153,SUPERVISOR,153,"I swear to God Brenna, between you
and Thompson's novels I'm going to
get a bloody ulcer."
154,CONOR,154,"Evening, Douglas."
155,DOUGLAS,155,Conor.
156,CONOR,156,Ale suits me.
157,TAVERN MAN #1,157,"We rather you not be sitting with
us, Conor."
158,TAVERN MAN #2,158,We be drinking alone as well.
159,CONOR,159,What's wrong with you all?
160,TAVERN MAN #2,160,Requiem acer'nam donaei-
161,CONOR,161,What are you doing man?
162,TAVERN MAN #2,162,-Et lux perpetua-
163,CONOR,163,"You'll not be bringing the church
into this."
164,TAVERN MAN #2,164,-Luceat ei-
165,CONOR,165,Be quiet.
166,TAVERN MAN #2,166,-Auditorium nostrum-
167,CONOR,167,Stop.
168,TAVERN MAN #2,168,-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
169,CONOR,169,Stop!
170,MOTHER,170,Please take care of yourself.
171,CONOR,171,Aye.
172,FATHER,172,I wish there was some other way.
173,FATHER,173,"Goodbye, Conor."
174,CONOR,174,Goodbye.
175,DESK OFFICER,175,This is against the rules.
176,BRENNA,176,"So's playing choo-choo with two
high school cheerleaders in the
middle of-"
177,DESK OFFICER,177,-Okay okay.
178,BRENNA,178,"You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute."
179,DESK OFFICER,179,"Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born
March 16, 1945 in Church Hill,
Maryland.  Received first driver
permit 1967 in Philadelphia."
180,BRENNA,180,"Church Hill, that's pretty close,
isn't it?"
181,DESK OFFICER,181,Anything in Maryland is close.
182,TAUPIN,182,Where is he?
183,TAUPIN,183,Where!
184,INTRUDER,184,I don't know.
185,TAUPIN,185,What name is he using?
186,INTRUDER,186,Smith.  Carl Smith.
187,TAUPIN,187,How many came?
188,INTRUDER,188,The last four.
189,TAUPIN,189,And the Bulgarian?
190,INTRUDER,190,He got him.
191,INTRUDER,191,He always does.  Eventually.
192,TAUPIN,192,He knows I'm here.  How?
193,INTRUDER,193,"None of this would be happening
if you hadn't run..."
194,TAUPIN,194,_Answer_ me.
195,INTRUDER,195,"We learned he'd found the immigration
notaries in Liverpool and traced them
to New York.  Then he figured out the
birth records in Church Hill..."
196,BRENNA,196,Taupin...Taupin...
197,BRENNA,197,"Tarmin...Tatum...Taupin, Richard
Marshall.  Born to William and
Karen Taupin, no address.  Attend-
ing physician, Dr. Willis Kidell."
198,KIDELL,198,"1945, that strains the memory."
199,KIDELL,199,"Here we are, Richard Taupin."
200,KIDELL,200,Would you like more tea?
201,BRENNA,201,"No thank you, I'm fine."
202,KIDELL,202,He was unsual.
203,BRENNA,203,Why?
204,KIDELL,204,"Well, this is a small town, and
it was even smaller then.  Most
all the babies I delivered were
from local families.  Richard's
parents were just passing through
when his mother's time came.  I
did it right here at the house."
205,BRENNA,205,"Then you didn't know Richard
later on."
206,KIDELL,206,No.
207,BRENNA,207,"I've been trying to find somebody
who knew him and any connections
his family might have had with
museums or historical societies."
208,KIDELL,208,"Don't know about any of that.
Suppose nobody does."
209,BRENNA,209,I don't follow you.
210,KIDELL,210,"Poor little tyke didn't have a
chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He
died a few days after he was born."
211,BRENNA,211,The boy _died_?
212,KIDELL,212,"Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The
young lady just couldn't make it
through labor.  Never even saw her
son."
213,KIDELL,213,"My brother worked for the town
paper at the time.  He took this
picture of the funeral."
214,BRENNA,214,"Have you spoken to anyone else
about this?"
215,KIDELL,215,"There was this one fella.  Asked
a lot of questions.  I was out
of town but I heard he spent near
a full day in the records office."
216,BRENNA,216,Would you remember his name?
217,KIDELL,217,Carl Smith.
218,OFFICER,218,Just tell us when you see the one.
219,UNCLE JOE,219,Forget it.
220,BRENNA,220,I'm just curious.
221,UNCLE JOE,221,"You're never ""just curious""."
222,UNCLE JOE,222,"You've met my neice, Brenna."
223,ASSISTANT,223,Hi Brenna.
224,OFFICER,224,"Number 5, lift your coat up more."
225,UNCLE JOE,225,"Aren't you getting a little old for
this?  You flunked out of law school."
226,BRENNA,226,Now there's a new topic.
227,UNCLE JOE,227,"Don't they have enough for you to
do at the castle?"
228,UNCLE JOE,228,"Forgers do it all the time.  They
take the birth certificate of some-
one who died young and use it to
get legit I.D.  Usually they carry
it long enough to pass some bad
checks then dump it."
229,BRENNA,229,Thanks.
230,UNCLE JOE,230,Call your mother.  You never call her.
231,OFFICER,231,Well?
232,OLD LADY,232,"I don't know.  I'd have to see his
thing."
233,BRENNA,233,"I can't figure out why he's doing it.
He's been Richard Taupin at least
since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You
should see the stuff he has in that shop."
234,DENNIS,234,Maybe he's hiding from something.
235,BRENNA,235,"Some guy named Smith was asking
about him in Church Hill.  I passed
his name around with your buddies
downtown but they drew a blank.  So
he isn't a cop.  District anyway."
236,DENNIS,236,"Probably just some exec ducking
an ex-wife."
237,BRENNA,237,"Dr. Kidell had a picture in his
file of the funeral.  The father
looked just like Richard.  Even had
a mark on his cheek."
238,DENNIS,238,How old is Richard?
239,BRENNA,239,"P.D. says 41, but he barely looks
30."
240,DENNIS,240,"Find the father.  That should clear
things up."
241,DENNIS,241,"Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran
picked up the other night?"
242,BRENNA,242,Yeah.
243,DENNIS,243,He'd want to know about all this.
244,BRENNA,244,"Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his
own clues.  There's a journal article
in this somewhere."
245,DENNIS,245,"Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't
get the taste out of her mouth."
246,DENNIS,246,"Well, the cream of society awaits."
247,DENNIS,247,If you're ever in the neighborhood...
248,BRENNA,248,Sure.
249,OFFICER,249,They found it.
250,OFFICER,250,"It was about fifty yards down-
stream from the head."
251,OFFICER,251,"Both were cut real clean.  Like the
other ones..."
252,MORAN,252,There's been another murder.
253,TAUPIN,253,My condolences.
254,MORAN,254,Where were you Tuesday night?
255,TAUPIN,255,Home.
256,MORAN,256,A neighbor saw your car leave.
257,TAUPIN,257,He's mistaken.
258,MORAN,258,"Look, I don't know what the hell
you're up to, but I think I've got
a pretty good idea."
259,TAUPIN,259,Do you?
260,MORAN,260,All I need is time.
261,TAUPIN,261,I've got all the time in the world.
262,TAUPIN,262,"Except right now.  If you will excuse
me, Lieutenant."
263,BRENNA,263,Someone beat you.
264,TAUPIN,264,"Have you taken to touring small
town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?"
265,BRENNA,265,Grave robbers?
266,TAUPIN,266,Probably.
267,BRENNA,267,Who?
268,TAUPIN,268,"People like that rarely leave
business cards."
269,BRENNA,269,Does Carl Smith?
270,TAUPIN,270,"I don't know what you're talking
about."
271,BRENNA,271,"I think you do.  Better yet, I don't
think anything was stolen because
nothing was there in the first place.
And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is,
now knows that."
272,TAUPIN,272,You have an active imagination.
273,BRENNA,273,I've been to Church Hill.
274,TAUPIN,274,"Miss Cartwright, you are
involving yourself in
matters that do not concern
you.  I strongly suggest you
return to Washington and stay
out of small town cemetaries."
275,BRENNA,275,I could find him.
276,BRENNA,276,I have friends.
277,TAUPIN,277,I doubt that.
278,(beat),278,"Good day, Miss Cartwright."
279,BRENNA,279,What's wrong?
280,TAUPIN,280,Your help may be unneccessary.
281,"VOICE
(o.s.)",281,"Good afternoon, ""Mr. Taupin""."
282,KNIGHT,282,Long time.
283,TAUPIN,283,Not so long.
284,TAUPIN,284,"You've been here from the
start."
285,KNIGHT,285,"My quarry grows clever with
age.  And the others, incompetent."
286,KNIGHT,286,Friend of yours?
287,TAUPIN,287,Of sorts.
288,KNIGHT,288,"I do hope she enjoys a good
show."
289,KNIGHT,289,So now it ends.
290,KNIGHT,290,"Generation upon generation.
Tens of thousands of miles."
291,KNIGHT,291,"You're the last, MacLeod.
Romirez, Lacroux, Neuvich,
those fools that followed
me, their heads all line my
shelf.  All but yours."
292,KNIGHT,292,"Can you feel it, MacLeod?
Can you _feel_ it!"
293,KNIGHT,293,There can be but one.
294,WATCHMAN,294,Hey!  What's going on here?
295,TAUPIN,295,Run!
296,TAUPIN,296,Run!
297,KNIGHT,297,MACLEOD!
298,BRENNA,298,Jesus Christ.
299,TAUPIN,299,"You'll be safe here.  He won't
kill in a church."
300,BRENNA,300,Why not?
301,TAUPIN,301,Tradition.
302,BRENNA,302,What the hell is going on?
303,CONOR,303,Afternoon.
304,ROMIREZ,304,Your name is Conor?
305,CONOR,305,Aye.
306,ROMIREZ,306,"Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief
surveyor and alchemist."
307,CONOR,307,"You're not from these
parts."
308,ROMIREZ,308,"I am from Spain.  And I
would like a moment of
your time."
309,CONOR,309,"I haven't much to offer,
Mr. Romirez from Spain,
but you're welcome to what's
here."
310,ROMIREZ,310,Please go to no trouble.
311,ROMIREZ,311,"Your back, it would seem
perhaps you were injured
in battle?"
312,CONOR,312,"Five years past me clan
fought another over some-
thing I cannot even re-
member."
313,ROMIREZ,313,"Your marks would suggest
great injury."
314,CONOR,314,I was nearly killed.
315,ROMIREZ,315,But you lived.
316,CONOR,316,I did at that.
317,ROMIREZ,317,"And but for a mark you are
well as any man, no?"
318,CONOR,318,Aye.
319,ROMIREZ,319,"I should imagine that your
recovery must have alarmed
your fellow villagers, perhaps
giving them reason to invent
an explanation.  And a solution."
320,CONOR,320,I was driven out.
321,ROMIREZ,321,"And now you live in a small
village miles away from all
you knew."
322,CONOR,322,How can you know this?
323,ROMIREZ,323,"First food, no?  A good meal
makes conversation so much
easier."
324,ROMIREZ,324,"Hmm, que rico.  What is it you
call this?"
325,CONOR,325,Pheasant.
326,ROMIREZ,326,"You Scots have a way with
game.  It still has life in it.
Spirit.  Back home the food
is so...domestic."
327,CONOR,327,Why are you here?
328,ROMIREZ,328,"I was sent by his majesty of
Spain to Inverness as a con-
sultant on matters of metal."
329,CONOR,329,You're a long way from Inverness.
330,ROMIREZ,330,"In my travels I heard the story of
the MacLeod boy struck down and
brought from the hand of
death by powers not of this Earth."
331,CONOR,331,You know me home.  Me name.
332,ROMIREZ,332,It was time for our paths to cross.
333,ROMIREZ,333,You see this?
334,ROMIREZ,334,"When I was a boy a cart driven
by a drunken fool crushed me.  All
thought I would die or be maimed
for life.  But I healed quickly.
And like you I paid the price
for being different."
335,CONOR,335,You are the same?
336,ROMIREZ,336,"Do you ever feel a flow, as if some-
thing were pushing against you?"
337,CONOR,337,Yes.  Always.
338,ROMIREZ,338,Does it change with me in the room?
339,CONOR,339,It is less.
340,ROMIREZ,340,You feel you know me.
341,CONOR,341,I don't know why.
342,ROMIREZ,342,We are brothers.
343,CONOR,343,"He told me there could be only
one."
344,ROMIREZ,344,"Some cling to sanity through time
with the one continuity and trad0
ition their lives have known: The
Game."
345,ROMIREZ,345,"You and I Conor, we are different
from all others around us.  You
know this, you can feel it.  We are
flesh and bone like any man, but
unlike our neighbors we are rather
difficult to injure,"
346,ROMIREZ,346,permanently.
347,CONOR,347,I don't understand.
348,ROMIREZ,348,You are still so very young.
349,CONOR,349,I'm twenty-two.
350,ROMIREZ,350,Not even a single lifetime.
351,ROMIREZ,351,"Conor, you and I, we cannot be
killed."
352,CONOR,352,What?
353,ROMIREZ,353,We are immortal.
354,CONOR,354,"No, that can't be."
355,ROMIREZ,355,It is as you are.
356,CONOR,356,No!
357,ROMIREZ,357,Listen to me.  Hear the words.
358,CONOR,358,This is madness!
359,ROMIREZ,359,It is the truth.
360,CONOR,360,No!
361,MALE VOICE,361,"This is Dr. Wickland at GWU.  Your
test came back today.  You can call
me here at the med center if you
have any questions."
362,SUPERVISOR'S VOICE,362,"Brenna, where the hell are you?
The place is full of cops asking
weird questions.  What's going on?
I've got work stacking up.  Get
in here right away."
363,KNIGHT'S VOICE,363,Brenna.
364,KNIGHT'S VOICE,364,"My quarrel is not with you.  Meet
me."
365,KNIGHT'S VOICE,365,"We have much to talk of, you and
I.  Answers for the young historian."
366,(beat),366,"O'Reily's.  Tonight.  I've grown to
like taverns."
367,SEVERAL LITTLE GIRLS,367,"Happy birthday to you, happy birth-
day to you, happy birthday dear
Brenna, happy birthday to you."
368,MOTHER'S VOICE,368,"Hi Brenna, it's mom.  Me and your neices
just wanted to call and wish you a
happy birthday.  Crissy made a real cute
card for you, be sure to call her.  Will
you be home for Easter?  Call when you
can.  Love you."
369,ROMIREZ,369,"Three days you've laid there.
It's time you ate."
370,CONOR,370,This can't be.
371,ROMIREZ,371,"You are not dead, boy.  Accept it."
372,CONOR,372,"This is monstrous.  I'll burn in
hell for all eternity."
373,ROMIREZ,373,You'd have to die first.
374,ROMIREZ,374,Aqui.
375,CONOR,375,"What is to become of me?  Am I to
wander the Earth forever like a
ghost?"
376,ROMIREZ,376,You will live.  Survive.
377,CONOR,377,"Then they were right.  I am evil.
This is God's punishment."
378,ROMIREZ,378,"You have done nothing wrong Conor
MacLeod."
379,CONOR,379,Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.
380,CONOR,380,Why does he want to kill me?
381,ROMIREZ,381,"You recall how I spoke of the push
you feel and how I make it less?"
382,CONOR,382,Aye.
383,ROMIREZ,383,"It is always less with my living.
Far or near.  But if I were to die
the push would become stronger
than ever before.  There is power
in this.  And as long as you and I
live, The Knight can never have
it all."
384,CONOR,384,But we cannot be killed.
385,ROMIREZ,385,"There is an imperfection.  For all
your healing, if your head ever
leaves your neck, you are dead.
You can survive anything but steel
against your threat.  Then it is
over.  The end."
386,CONOR,386,How can I stop such a man?
387,ROMIREZ,387,"Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth
till you learn.  You must learn to
defend yourself.  In this I can help."
388,CONOR,388,Why?
389,ROMIREZ,389,"We are brothers.  And you are a
defense-"
390,(beat),390,-of sorts.
391,MR. NORTH,391,"When your father died I saw to
it that the grounds were kept up."
392,TAUPIN,392,"The money in the estate was
enough to cover your costs?"
393,MR. NORTH,393,"Oh yes, more than enough."
394,MR. NORTH,394,"Most of the furniture was put
into protective storage.  I'll
have some boys come up and clean
the place out for you."
395,MR. NORTH,395,"You're one of William's kids,
huh?"
396,TAUPIN,396,His only kid.
397,MR. NORTH,397,"Sure take after him.  Never seen
a father and son look more alike."
398,TAUPIN,398,We were very close.
399,MR. NORTH,399,The resemblance is amazing.
400,TAUPIN,400,When may I expect the cleaners?
401,MR. NORTH,401,I'll send them right up.
402,MAN,402,"That stuff'll put you away if
you're not careful."
403,BRENNA,403,"There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He
would invite the local peasants to
his chateau, fill them full of wine,
then slice their bellies so he
could reuse it."
404,(smiles),404,"The symmetry of that somehow always
appealed to me."
405,MAN,405,You're very macabre.
406,BRENNA,406,It's my birthday.
407,MAN,407,Happy birthday.
408,BRENNA,408,Thanks.
409,BRENNA,409,Buy a birthday girl a drink?
410,TAUPIN,410,Lager and lime.
411,KAHN,411,MacLeod.
412,KAHN,412,Spare a chair?
413,TAUPIN,413,Kahn?
414,KAHN,414,"Are you going to offer me a chair
or leave me standing here all night?"
415,TAUPIN,415,Sit.
416,TAUPIN,416,How are you?
417,KAHN,417,Head still secure to the neck.
418,TAUPIN,418,How did you find me?
419,KAHN,419,"How many places this side of the
Atlantic serve lager and lime?"
420,KAHN,420,Old habits die hard.
421,KAHN,421,Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!
422,(beat),422,"Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the
closest thing they stock to my side
of the fence."
423,TAUPIN,423,What are you doing here?
424,KAHN,424,"It is the gathering, my friend.  The
settling of old scores."
425,TAUPIN,425,"And have you something to settle
with me?"
426,"KAHN
(smiles)",426,"Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink
with an old friend."
427,TAUPIN,427,"It's good to see you, Kahn."
428,KAHN,428,"Come, toast with me the past."
429,KAHN,429,"To old conquests, old loves, and to a
time when we cared about either."
430,KAHN,430,Waitress!
431,KAHN,431,"I'll never forget the look on that
Papal commander's face when his
""heretic stronghold"" turned out to
be a rock full of whores climbing
all over Neuvich."
432,TAUPIN,432,"Neuvich, the clown of the crusades."
433,KAHN,433,"But then rides up Pope Pius who
calmly brushes the dust from his
papal cross, climbs off his papal
horse, draws his papal sword and
asks just what the hell is going
on.  And what did Neuvich, dear
dear drunken Neuvich do?"
434,TAUPIN,434,Offered the Pope one of his whores.
435,TAUPIN,435,"Had a great swing with his blade.
For a Pope."
436,"KAHN
(sighs)",436,"Good times then.  A man could
stretch his legs without bring-
ing half the world down around
his ears.  Not like now."
437,TAUPIN,437,He found us even there.
438,KAHN,438,He always did.
439,TAUPIN,439,I haven't drunk this much since-
440,KAHN,440,-Since you last saw me.
441,KAHN,441,Come on.
442,KAHN,442,"I love zoos.  Ever since I was
a kid."
443,TAUPIN,443,You were never a kid.
444,KAHN,444,I knew his great-grandfather.
445,TAUPIN,445,You're insane.
446,KAHN,446,"No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool
together in Rangoon."
447,TAUPIN,447,"How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you
live so full of life for so long?"
448,KAHN,448,"Tasting and enjoying life is the
only thing of value we have.  All
else is just marking time."
449,(beat),449,You're marking time.
450,TAUPIN,450,I've had a few more concerns.
451,KAHN,451,"The pressure only comes when you
let the taste slip into your mouth."
452,TAUPIN,452,You're wrong.
453,KAHN,453,"You don't run as hard, MacLeod.
You just don't run as hard anymore."
454,AUCTIONEER,454,"I apoligize for the lateness of the
hour, but I'm sure you will all agree
the quality of this year's collection
is well worth the time."
455,AUCTIONEER,455,"For this fine example of medieval
religious art, let us open the bid
at 4,000 dollars."
456,AUCTIONEER,456,"10,500 once, 10,500 twice..."
457,AUCTIONEER,457,"11,000.  A bid at 11,000."
458,BRENNA,458,"No, I-"
459,BRENNA,459,"Mr. Taupin?  I have to talk to
you."
460,TAUPIN,460,Finished?
461,BRENNA,461,He tried to kill me last night.
462,TAUPIN,462,Where?
463,BRENNA,463,Dupont Circle.
464,BRENNA,464,Who is he?
465,TAUPIN,465,At the moment?  Carl Smith.
466,BRENNA,466,And you?
467,BRENNA,467,What will you do now?
468,TAUPIN,468,"You needn't worry Miss Cartwright.
I've been at this a very long time."
469,BRENNA,469,"He called you ""MacLeod""."
470,TAUPIN,470,Not your concern.
471,BRENNA,471,"I left a man dead in
Felton.  But you don't
really care, do you?"
472,TAUPIN,472,That bothers you?
473,BRENNA,473,He was innocent.
474,TAUPIN,474,"He's dead.  Whatever I may
or may not feel means
exceedingly little to him
now."
475,BRENNA,475,What about me?
476,TAUPIN,476,You?
477,BRENNA,477,"I'm a witness to a murder.  That
seems to put me pretty high
on your friend's chop list."
478,TAUPIN,478,"Have you gone to the
police?"
479,BRENNA,479,No.
480,TAUPIN,480,"Why not?  I'm sure they'd
love to hear your story."
481,BRENNA,481,I'd rather hear yours.
482,"TAUPIN
(beat)",482,You are being foolish.
483,BRENNA,483,"I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin.
Only once in a lifetime do you
stare history in the face."
484,TAUPIN,484,Go home.
485,BRENNA,485,Why does he want to kill you?
486,TAUPIN,486,He sees me as a threat.
487,BRENNA,487,Are you?
488,ROMIREZ,488,Concentrate!
489,ROMIREZ,489,Harder.  Concentrate harder.
490,CONOR,490,Me arm hurts.
491,ROMIREZ,491,Again.  Try again.
492,ROMIREZ,492,"Harder!  You swing like an impotent
cow!"
493,CONOR,493,Go to hell.
494,ROMIREZ,494,"Oh, the boy has a mouth,
now if only he had an arm."
495,CONOR,495,Impotent cow.
496,ROMIREZ,496,Muy Bien!
497,ROMIREZ,497,"Here my boy, from vineyards
as sweet and smooth as a young
girl's thigh."
498,ROMIREZ,498,"It will take less effort
as you learn."
499,CONOR,499,It's like to kill me first.
500,ROMIREZ,500,"You have a gift.  One you
must protect."
501,CONOR,501,"And what is this great
gift that cannot be seen
or smelt?"
502,ROMIREZ,502,"The Fabric of life.  The spark
that allows the passing of
existence from one generation
to another."
503,CONOR,503,"If that was meant to be an ex-
planation Mr. Romirez from Spain,
I'm afraid you've failed."
504,ROMIREZ,504,"Come.  Enough sword play for an
afternoon."
505,CONOR,505,"You're no match for Scot, Mr.
Romirez.  We're raised as riders."
506,ROMIREZ,506,"Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod."
507,CONOR,507,"What is the fascinatioon?  It is only
a leaf."
508,ROMIREZ,508,"All living things pay dues,
Conor.  They must be respected
for that."
509,ROMIREZ,509,"As they age they contribute to a
sum that is the kindling from which
all future life comes.  To feel it,
to know it, is to be in touch with
the will of every living thing."
510,CONOR,510,"I do not think I like the sound
of that."
511,ROMIREZ,511,"It does not feel nearly as frightening
as it sounds.  But the consequences of
such feelings can be very frightening.
For it gives you great strength.  The
strength of _knowledge_.  The ability
to stand between the giving of what
has always been to what will always
be."
512,CONOR,512,I feel hardly nothing.
513,ROMIREZ,513,"You have not been fully trained.
But you will learn.  And you will be
good, I can feel that.  You have apt-
itude.  This is why our friend is
so concerned."
514,CONOR,514,But why be so concerned about me?
515,ROMIREZ,515,"This power is divided amongst you,
me, and others like cuts in a pie.
But the cuts are not equal.  Some,
like you and he, have more.  Much
more."
516,CONOR,516,And you?
517,ROMIREZ,517,"I am a small player.  But if by
helping you I can keep that monster
from being the last, then perhaps
my life has meant something."
518,CONOR,518,I am not ready for this.
519,ROMIREZ,519,"You must be.  You have responsibilities.
You must learn the rules.  You can never
attract attention to yourself, never
show the side that will draw others to
you.  You will always know when you are
in the presence of another.  Beware.
But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will
be your battle against time.  In the
coming years you will see kingdoms rise
then rot like wheat.  People will
become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The
only constant you will know will be
the others and the tradition their
greed and quest represent.  But life
without morality, without the ability
to truly taste the sweetness of wine
and love, is no life at all.  That is
how the others exist.  Nothing more
than walking corpses living only to
slaughter each other in an insane quest
to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed
to the earth.  Do not become one of them."
520,CONOR,520,Of course.
521,ROMIREZ,521,"You are young, inexperienced.  You
do not know what time can do.  How
it can sap all pity, all love."
522,CONOR,522,That is not me.
523,ROMIREZ,523,"With the proper tools, Conor, a
naive man can be much more dangerous
than an evil one."
524,VILLAGER,524,Conor!
525,CONOR,525,"Yes, Darin."
526,VILLAGER,526,"Hate to be bothering you like this,
but me mare threw a shoe."
527,ROMIREZ,527,"Go ahead, Senor."
528,ROMIREZ,528,I have my friend to keep me company.
529,CONOR,529,I'll be back when I can.
530,KNIGHT,530,Romirez.  What a surprise.
531,ROMIREZ,531,Madonna!
532,KNIGHT,532,Bastard!
533,ROMIREZ,533,"Oh, Santa Maria!"
534,KNIGHT,534,Why run?
535,ROMIREZ,535,Demonio!
536,KNIGHT,536,To hell with you.
537,LIBRARIAN,537,"Come on Brenna, your ass
is already in a sling, don't
drag me into it."
538,BRENNA,538,"All I need is for you
to check the name."
539,LIBRARIAN,539,"You talked to your supervisor
lately?  He's burning up the
place about you just dropping
out of sight.  That on top of
the cops bugging him."
540,BRENNA,540,"I'll take care of that
Corey, but I need this now."
541,BRENNA,541,"Corey, you _owe_ me."
542,LIBRARIAN,542,It's that important?
543,BRENNA,543,Yeah.
544,RESEARCHER,544,Wilson know about this?
545,BRENNA,545,I'm doing it on my own.
546,LIBRARIAN,546,Good way to lose your job.
547,BRENNA,547,"Some job.  Card filing and
cabinet dusting.  Four years
in this dump and I haven't
written anything for Wilson
that a wounded yak couldn't
do."
548,LIBRARIAN,548,"I liked the bit you did
about Baltic chastity belts.
Too bad no one else did."
549,BRENNA,549,"It's bullshit.  Everything.
My job, the people I get
involved with, I'm up to here
with it."
550,LIBRARIAN,550,"You always were hard to
impress."
551,BRENNA,551,Who is it?
552,LIBRARIAN,552,"Not who.  What.  Worstick's
a town in Pennsylvania."
553,BRENNA,553,"Chris, have you seen my
notebook?"
554,BRENNA,554,"Why, that son of a bitch."
555,BRENNA,555,"What's wrong Wilson, huh?  Not enough
excitement in your own desk?  What the
hell were you looking for in mine?"
556,MORAN,556,A murder.
557,BRENNA,557,"You better have a warrant.  That's
my notebook, you've got no right
to be sticking your fingers into it."
558,MORAN,558,"I've got a morgue filling up with
bodies.  That's my right."
559,BRENNA,559,What do you want from me?
560,MORAN,560,"Well, the man of the hour that we
all would like to talk to about now
has apparently skipped town."
561,MORAN,561,"And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's
ambulence chaser is an expert on
missing persons."
562,BRENNA,562,I'm calling an attorney.
563,MORAN,563,You and I should talk first.
564,BRENNA,564,We've got nothing to say.
565,MORAN,565,"What are you going to tell them?  That
you're protecting a man who's
killed four people?"
566,BRENNA,566,Four?
567,MORAN,567,All fashionably without heads.
568,BRENNA,568,Spare me the details.
569,MORAN,569,"But there's more.  Wednesday someone
played javelin with the cemetary
curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some
locals spotted two cars with D.C.
plates and surprise surprise, they
turn out to be registered to our
own Brenna Cartwright and the ever
popular Richard Taupin."
570,BRENNA,570,"What are you getting at, Moran?"
571,MORAN,571,"You've been a busy little beaver.
Especially with that records mess
up in Church Hill."
572,MORAN,572,"Your notes are very complete.
Naturally my feelings were crushed
when you didn't rush right over
and tell us what you knew."
573,MORAN,573,"In fact, we're considering book-
ing the ambulence chaser as an
accessory to murder."
574,BRENNA,574,It'll never stick.
575,MORAN,575,"But we might just give it the
'ole college try.  What with the
court back ups, it could be days
before you got an arraignment.
But then, I'm sure the flunk-out
neice of the D.A. knows all about
that."
576,BRENNA,576,"You're an asshole, Moran."
577,MORAN,577,I want Taupin.
578,BRENNA,578,"What makes you so sure he's
the one?"
579,MORAN,579,"Just for laughs we raided wonder
boy's house.  There was a gallon
of one of the corpse's blood in
his carpet.  I think it was about
then I withdrew his name for
humanitarian of the year."
580,BRENNA,580,"What's all of this got to do
with me?"
581,MORAN,581,What were you doing in Felton?
582,BRENNA,582,"Research.  If your pal was there
I never saw him."
583,MORAN,583,"I have witnesses that can put
the two of you together."
584,BRENNA,584,"Never take up poker, Detective."
585,MORAN,585,"Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck
can be sliced as fast as anyone
else's."
586,BRENNA,586,"Why don't you wait until it comes
out in paperback?"
587,DENNIS,587,I warned you.
588,BRENNA,588,Go to hell.
589,TAUPIN,589,You shouldn't have come.
590,TAUPIN,590,We're you followed?
591,BRENNA,591,No.
592,TAUPIN,592,No one knows you're here?
593,BRENNA,593,No.  I had to talk to you.
594,TAUPIN,594,You had to do _nothing_!
595,BRENNA,595,You're wrong.
596,TAUPIN,596,You're a fool.
597,BRENNA,597,Maybe.
598,TAUPIN,598,Come inside.
599,BRENNA,599,Is this what you killed them with?
600,TAUPIN,600,You've been listening to rumors.
601,BRENNA,601,"Our cars were seen together in
Felton.  They're calling me an
accessory to murder."
602,TAUPIN,602,You are.  Now.
603,TAUPIN,603,"There's several bedrooms down the
hall.  Take your pick."
604,OFFICER,604,"No, that's the last place we saw
her.  Okay, will do."
605,PARTNER,605,Well?
606,"OFFICER
(shrugs)",606,We keep looking.
607,PARTNER,607,Wonderful.
608,BRENNA,608,What's all that?
609,TAUPIN,609,"Richard Taupin has become
cumbersome.  It would be best
if he just disappeared."
610,BRENNA,610,You did kill those men.
611,TAUPIN,611,Not all of them.
612,BRENNA,612,"When you finish, what then?"
613,TAUPIN,613,"I go my way and you can write
all you want about the big bad
Mr. Taupin."
614,BRENNA,614,You make it all sound so simple.
615,TAUPIN,615,"The only real difficulty comes
in changing over the ownership
of property I've aquired.  That
requires certain records and
most importantly a personal
appearance at the county seat in
Gettysburg.  But that's where
you come in."
616,BRENNA,616,You want me to front for you.
617,TAUPIN,617,"The less exposure I recieve
around government buildings the
better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin,
will attract considerably less
attention than I."
618,TAUPIN,618,"Not such a bad trade.  The story
of a lifetime for a few days
work?"
619,INSPECTOR,619,They lost her outside of Thurmont.
620,MORAN,620,"I want people in here to check
over every piece of this stuff."
621,INSPECTOR,621,Figure she's with him?
622,MORAN,622,Yeah.
623,INSPECTOR,623,"We ran down that Church Hill info.
She's right.  There is no Richard
Taupin."
624,MORAN,624,Any other I.D.s come up?
625,INSPECTOR,625,"Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday.
Thompson's going to try CIA
this afternoon."
626,INSPECTOR,626,Y'never know.
627,MORAN,627,"Should have seen him the first
night.  Son of a bitch stood there
with a quart of blood on his
pant leg and didn't even blink."
628,INSPECTOR,628,You'd think he'd had practice.
629,MORAN,629,I think he has.
630,AIDE,630,"The men are assembled, Major."
631,GENERAL,631,"See that they are indeed ready,
Dupont."
632,DUPONT (CONOR),632,Yes General.
633,STAFF SARGEANT,633,"Regiment ready for review, sir."
634,DUPONT,634,"Stand straight, you are a soldier
of the King."
635,SOLDIER #1,635,Yes sir.
636,DUPONT,636,Where is your bayonet?
637,SOLIDER #3,637,Lost it sir.
638,DUPONT,638,Where?
639,STAFF SARGEANT,639,You heard the Major!  Where!
640,SOLDIER #3,640,Whorehouse sir.
641,DUPONT,641,Your rifle.  Hand it to me.
642,DUPONT,642,"The flint is cracked.  No spark
will reach your powder.  You will
die tomorrow."
643,DUPONT,643,"Tomorrow you go to _battle_!  And
you look like children!"
644,(beat),644,"The General has charged me with
seeing that you are prepared, and
prepared you will be!  If necessary
you stand here all night!  Sargeant!"
645,SARGEANT,645,Yes sir.
646,DUPONT,646,See to it.
647,SARGEANT,647,Yes sir.
648,DUPONT,648,Your name?
649,MULET,649,Mulet.
650,"CAPTAIN
(amused)",650,"...And what a sight!  That old
mare just kept falling over her
own guts till someone finally
shot her."
651,MAJOR,651,Complete your inspection?
652,DUPONT,652,"They're nothing but boys.  It
will be a slaughter tomorrow."
653,"MAJOR
(laughs)",653,"I doubt much can change that.
The enemy has five brigades
waiting for us."
654,DUPONT,654,We need more time.
655,MAJOR,655,Won't get it.
656,MAJOR,656,We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
657,MAJOR,657,"Eat up Dupont.  It will probably
be your last."
658,"DUPONT
(rises)",658,Not likely.
659,DUPONT (CONOR),659,"I thought I gave orders the
regiment was to drill."
660,MULET,660,"Staff sargeant detailed me to
prepare firewood for the break-
fast cooking."
661,DUPONT,661,What is your position?
662,MULET,662,Second musketeer.
663,DUPONT,663,"I understand you joined up in
Bremen."
664,MULET,664,"You seem to understand a great
deal."
665,DUPONT,665,"I am a Major, Private.  You would
do well remembering that when
addressing me."
666,MULET,666,"Excuse me, ""sir"".  I thought we
spoke as equals."
667,DUPONT,667,Equals?
668,MULET,668,"If you wish to play games, Major."
669,DUPONT,669,"Wait.  I think we understand each
other."
670,MULET,670,We have no understanding.
671,DUPONT,671,"Then it is time two of us did.
You are very young.  I was once
young.  I can help."
672,MULET,672,"Help?  I've seen others ""help"".
Somehow a head always ended up
on the counter."
673,DUPONT,673,It can be different.  It must be.
674,MULET,674,"It never changes, Major."
675,DUPONT,675,We must talk.
676,MULET,676,Stay out of it.
677,"DUPONT
(angry)",677,"Don't threaten me, Private."
678,"MULET
(disgust)",678,"Who do you think I am?  One of your
freckle faced children waiting to
die tomorrow?  ""Threaten you""?  You
and I just living will always be a
threat.  Forever.  Look at your life,
Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there
but threat.  Threats and nothingness.
It's what we live for."
679,DUPONT,679,Do not turn your back on me.
680,MULET,680,"You are really going to force this,
aren't you?"
681,DUPONT,681,Either you are with me or against me.
682,MULET,682,Have I a choice?
683,MULET,683,"You see Major?  You are not so
different."
684,MULET,684,"You see Major?  You are not so
different..."
685,DUPONT,685,I had no choice.
686,DUPONT,686,Who am I deceiving?
687,KNIGHT,687,Certainly not me.
688,KNIGHT,688,"You needn't look so flushed,
Major.  You are quite safe in
church."
689,KNIGHT,689,State of grace and all that.
690,DUPONT,690,Tradition.
691,KNIGHT,691,It's all we have.
692,KNIGHT,692,"All this time and still a scared
little boy."
693,DUPONT,693,Not so scared.
694,KNIGHT,694,Perhaps not.
695,(smiles),695,"You seem to have misplaced a
private.  No doubt by now his
head is stranger to his neck."
696,DUPONT,696,No doubt.
697,KNIGHT,697,"You surprise me.  Eliminating a
rival like that.  Such are the
actions of a man of conquest.  I
was mistaken.  300 years have
turned the boy's fear into ambit-
ion."
698,DUPONT,698,You're wrong.
699,KNIGHT,699,"I know you very well, Conor MacLeod.
And I can see the truth beginning
to make itself clear to you.  Mulet,
Romirez, they were fools without
vision.  It was destined that the
board would be cleared for the real
players."
700,DUPONT,700,Romirez understood.  Not you.
701,KNIGHT,701,Romirez is dust.
702,KNIGHT,702,Finish your prayers?
703,DUPONT,703,Finish yours?
704,"KNIGHT
(smiles)",704,Our common heritage.
705,(beat),705,"I am your only real friend, you
know.  The only one who truly
understands you."
706,(rises),706,"I look forward to the day we
meet again.  And I kill you."
707,DUPONT,707,So sure?
708,KNIGHT,708,You can't stay in church forever.
709,KNIGHT,709,"Good night, Major."
710,MR. NORTH,710,Morning Mr. North
711,TAUPIN,711,Same.
712,MR. NORTH,712,"Such a pretty day.  If I live
to be 90 I'll never tire of
mornings like this.  Mind you
I'm 74 now."
713,TAUPIN,713,No.
714,MR. NORTH,714,"Yes sir.  When you get older your
priorities change.  It's the simple
things that count.  Without them
growing old can be a very lonely
thing."
715,TAUPIN,715,I'm sure that's true.
716,TAUPIN,716,"Here.  The hook should go just below
the head, where the meat is toughest."
717,GRANDSON,717,Thanks.
718,TAUPIN,718,Show you a trick.
719,TAUPIN,719,"Fish are creatures of habit.  They
like their food where they're used
to it.  At the top, hiding in old
leaves."
720,GRANDSON,720,Where did you learn that?
721,TAUPIN,721,My father taught me.
722,GRANDSON,722,Your father must be smart.
723,TAUPIN,723,"Yes, he was."
724,TAUPIN,724,"There was a man once.  Just a simple
woodcarver.  But he understood.  More
than anyone he could see to the heart
of it."
725,(beat),725,"It never ends.  Today is the same as
the first.  Tomorrow will be the
same as today.  So much time.  And all
of it wasted."
726,(beat),726,You love history?
727,BRENNA,727,Yes.
728,TAUPIN,728,I wish I could.
729,BRENNA,729,"The estate stuff is pretty straight
forward.  Just lots of forms and an
appearance at the county seat."
730,TAUPIN,730,"It will take some time for the
forms to clear before you go to
Gettysburg."
731,TAUPIN,731,Second thoughts?
732,BRENNA,732,No.
733,(beat),733,So what now?  We just wait?
734,TAUPIN,734,Yes.
735,BRENNA,735,"Well, as long as we're stuck here."
736,BRENNA,736,"It's some sort of party the
town is throwing."
737,TAUPIN,737,They do it each year.
738,BRENNA,738,"I thought it might be a nice break
from all of this."
739,TAUPIN,739,Maybe it would do us both good.
740,BRENNA,740,"There's a catch.  You're supposed
to wear 19th century clothing."
741,TAUPIN,741,"My father was something of a
junk collector."
742,TAUPIN,742,"Here, try this.  I suppose they're
still making women the same as back
then."
743,BRENNA,743,It's beautiful.
744,TAUPIN,744,A little dusty.
745,KATHERINE,745,Do it again.
746,CONOR,746,All right.
747,CONOR,747,A lion.
748,KATHERINE,748,Oh please.  Another one.
749,CONOR,749,What would you like?
750,KATHERINE,750,Something pretty.
751,CONOR,751,Like you.
752,KATHERINE,752,"That's wonderful.  Where did you
ever learn it?"
753,CONOR,753,Far away.
754,KATHERINE,754,Kiss me.
755,"YOUNG MAN
(o.s.)",755,You'll be leaving the girl alone.
756,KATHERINE,756,David.
757,CONOR,757,"Do you have cause to bothering
us?"
758,YOUNG MAN,758,That's my girl.
759,KATHERINE,759,"David, we've already spoken of this."
760,YOUNG MAN,760,He's not what he pretends to be.
761,CONOR,761,"You best leave, son."
762,YOUNG MAN,762,"You think you're so high and
mighty, coming into town and
taking a man's woman.  Well I
know about you.  I know about
the things you do."
763,CONOR,763,I said you best leave.
764,YOUNG MAN,764,"You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
765,YOUNG MAN,765,"Ask him about his friends.  The
ones he meets in the town square.
Ask him about the blade he keeps
beneath his bed."
766,CONOR,766,Leave.  While you still can.
767,YOUNG MAN,767,You don't frighten me.
768,CONOR,768,I should.
769,KATHERINE,769,"No!  Leave him.  Please don't hurt him.
Please."
770,YOUNG MAN,770,He's not what you think.
771,YOUNG MAN,771,He's not what you think!
772,KATHERINE,772,"I don't care who you are or where
you come from."
773,KATHERINE,773,I love you.
774,MR. NORTH,774,"Mr. Taupin!  Glad you could make it.
Best get some punch before it's
gone.  Near the whole valley showed
up."
775,WOMAN,775,"If I didn't know better I'd say
William Taupin."
776,TAUPIN,776,His son.  Richard.
777,MR. NORTH,777,"Mr. Taupin is up from Washington
to look over his father's estate."
778,WOMAN,778,"Your father died some years ago.
This is your first visit?"
779,TAUPIN,779,Of sorts.
780,WOMAN,780,"I suppose a Taupin had to show
up eventually."
781,TAUPIN,781,"Good evening, Mrs. Butler."
782,BRENNA,782,What was all that about?
783,MR. NORTH,783,"Sorry Mr. Taupin.  That's not meant
for you.  Just some didn't take
much to your father."
784,BRENNA,784,Why?
785,TAUPIN,785,"My father was never one for social
whirls."
786,MR. TAUPIN,786,"Kept to himself for sure.  Then with
all that business in '31."
787,BRENNA,787,What business?
788,MR. NORTH,788,"Family down the road from the
Taupin place was murdered.  All
cut up they were.  Horrible.  Two
strangers were also found with
the bodies.  No one ever accused
William, but with his reputation
as a loner and the rumors about
him and some of the wives in town,
folks just never forgot.  Most
were relieved when they heard he'd
died.  Sorry Mr. Taupin."
789,TAUPIN,789,Nothing to be sorry about.
790,MR. NORTH,790,Just your pappy scared some.
791,PORTLY,791,"All right, the kids have had their
fun.  Now it's time for a little
more traditional dancing."
792,BRENNA,792,"I don't know any of these.  I'll
make a fool of myself."
793,TAUPIN,793,Follow me.
794,BRENNA,794,"William Taupin seems to have left
his mark."
795,TAUPIN,795,Yes.
796,BRENNA,796,"And you are William
Taupin, aren't you?"
797,TAUPIN,797,Yes.
798,BRENNA,798,"You're using your son's
name."
799,TAUPIN,799,"No.  Just the child of
some lonely girl I gave
a ride to.  When they
died I put them in a
grave with my name on it.
Twenty years later I
became the son."
800,TAUPIN,800,More punch?
801,BRENNA,801,"Then you must be at least
70 years old."
802,TAUPIN,802,At least.
803,BRENNA,803,That's impossible.
804,BRENNA,804,"It's frightening sometimes the
way you talk about other people's
lives."
805,TAUPIN,805,A factor of age.
806,BRENNA,806,I hope I never get that old.
807,TAUPIN,807,You won't.
808,BRENNA,808,"I must be insane.  Leaving work,
ditching cops.  All to follow a
murderer.  A very old murderer,
but a murderer just the same."
809,TAUPIN,809,Why are you here?
810,BRENNA,810,"I've been telling myself it's the
award winning journal article I'm
going to write.  But it's not."
811,BRENNA,811,It's you.
812,TAUPIN,812,I see.
813,BRENNA,813,I'm not even sure why.
814,TAUPIN,814,"Hardly a reason to run off with
a murderer."
815,BRENNA,815,"My life has been chock full of
people with complications and weak-
nesses.  I can't stand it.  But
you're different.  It's in your
hands.  A clarity."
816,TAUPIN,816,"You are a very perceptive young
woman."
817,BRENNA,817,Just a little crazy.
818,TAUPIN,818,"Miss Cartwright, it's time I
showed you something."
819,TAUPIN,819,Miss Cartwright?
820,BRENNA,820,My God.
821,TAUPIN,821,"I had this room built some
time ago."
822,BRENNA,822,Who are you?
823,TAUPIN,823,That would be difficult to explain.
824,BRENNA,824,I'd like you to try.
825,TAUPIN,825,"I was born Conor MacLeod in the
village of Ardvrek on the High-
land plain of Strathnaver in the
clan of MacLeod under the King
of Scotland.  On the eleventh of
December, 1408."
826,TAUPIN,826,"I have served in the armies of
twelve nations, married nine
women, fathered thirty-eight
children and buried them all."
827,TAUPIN,827,"I carried that rifle in World
War I.  This book is a 16th Century
policy report for the King of
Austria.  The diploma is my con-
ference of degree in Latin from
Trinity College.  Class of 1672."
828,(beat),828,It goes on.
829,BRENNA,829,"That's why Smith called you
MacLeod."
830,TAUPIN,830,Yes.
831,BRENNA,831,He knows about you.
832,TAUPIN,832,He is older than I.
833,BRENNA,833,"What could possibly be worth all
this murder and distruction."
834,TAUPIN,834,"Sometimes I think it's just for
something to do.  A conquest to
be the last.  Something to hold
onto while everything else around
you withers and blows away.  Some-
thing to replace the love that can
never work."
835,BRENNA,835,That's insane.
836,TAUPIN,836,"Perhaps.  There is something more.
An inheritance."
837,BRENNA,837,Of bodies.
838,TAUPIN,838,I didn't kill the watchman.
839,BRENNA,839,You killed those other two.
840,TAUPIN,840,Not the same.
841,BRENNA,841,What about that family in '31?
842,TAUPIN,842,Sometimes innocents become involved.
843,BRENNA,843,"You and your buddy make a real
team, don't you?  Exchanging
eloquent threats in iambic pen-
tameter while hacking up all
the innocents in between."
844,TAUPIN,844,There are differences.
845,BRENNA,845,You kill with your left hand?
846,TAUPIN,846,I haven't killed _you_.
847,BRENNA,847,Is that a threat?
848,TAUPIN,848,No.
849,BRENNA,849,Don't.
850,TAUPIN,850,"Come here, Brenna."
851,BRENNA,851,Damn you.
852,MINISTER,852,"May God commend into his kingdom
the soul of our dear departed
Jason, son of Katherine-"
853,MINISTER,853,And brother to Howard and James-
854,OLD WOMAN,854,You.
855,CONOR,855,Katherine.
856,OLD WOMAN,856,What are you doing here?
857,CONOR,857,I owe him this.
858,OLD WOMAN,858,He never knew you.
859,SON #1,859,"Is something wrong, Mother?"
860,OLD WOMAN,860,"Howard.  James.  This is your
father..."
861,TAUPIN,861,"""Brenna"".  In Celtic is means
""woman with raven hair"".  Only
chieftan's daughters were allowed
it."
862,BRENNA,862,What is it like?  Being you?
863,TAUPIN,863,"Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that
would kill you and fear of those that
would love you.  It can never last, and
in the end you always end up destroying
both."
864,BRENNA,864,"But you're known so much.
History I'll only read about."
865,TAUPIN,865,"It's all the same.  Half lives that
never go away."
866,BRENNA,866,What is it you want?
867,TAUPIN,867,All of it finished.
868,TAUPIN,868,"Gettysburg's an hour's drive
at most.  You should be back
by nightfall."
869,BRENNA,869,Will I see you again?
870,TAUPIN,870,"Be careful.  Don't stay any
longer than you have to."
871,TAUPIN,871,Good luck.
872,MORAN,872,Are you sure?
873,INSPECTOR,873,"Won't know till the
records department comes
back with it this after-
noon.  Looks good though.
They found the receipt
in his townhouse.  It was
pretty smeared but had
Taupin's father listed
as a signatory."
874,MORAN,874,"Round up who you can
and put them on standby."
875,INSPECTOR,875,"Think we should call the
local P.D. out there
first?"
876,MORAN,876,"No.  I want this to be
all ours."
877,CLERK,877,"O.K. Mrs. Taupin, that's
all I need."
878,CLERK,878,"Just take this down
the hall to the regis-
trar.  Hurry up though,
it's near closing time.
Most everyone's gone
home already."
879,CLERK #2,879,I'll be right back.
880,BRENNA,880,"Do you have a drinking
fountain?"
881,CLERK #3,881,Around the corner.
882,"BRENNA
(crying)",882,Oh God...
883,BRENNA,883,"Go away!  Oh God, go
away!"
884,KNIGHT'S VOICE,884,"We have some unfinished
business."
885,TAUPIN,885,Are you here?
886,KNIGHT'S VOICE,886,"I want you to come to
me."
887,TAUPIN,887,And if I refuse?
888,KNIGHT'S VOICE,888,"Give me an address where
I can forward Miss Cart-
wright's head."
889,KNIGHT'S VOICE,889,"Yes laddie, I have her."
890,TAUPIN,890,Should I care?
891,KNIGHT,891,You have three hours.
892,INSPECTOR,892,He's not here.
893,KNIGHT,893,Welcome.
894,KNIGHT,894,Kahn sends his best.
895,TAUPIN,895,Let her go.
896,KNIGHT,896,You disappoint me.
897,KNIGHT,897,"I thought you'd finally gotten over
that sort of thing."
898,TAUPIN,898,Leave her out of this.
899,KNIGHT,899,As you wish.
900,KNIGHT,900,You can do better than that.
901,BOY,901,It's from over near the memorial.
902,BOY,902,Shit.
903,MORAN,903,"Moran.  All right, get a patrol
unit out there right away.  I'll
meet them."
904,KNIGHT,904,No.  Not now.
905,DENNIS,905,Brenna?
906,KNIGHT,906,Get up.
907,TAUPIN,907,What's the point?
908,KNIGHT,908,This isn't done.  Get up.
909,TAUPIN,909,"What's the point!  You have me,
finish it!"
910,KNIGHT,910,"I have waited forever for this.
You will not cheapen it, little
boy."
911,"TAUPIN
(irony)",911,Tradition.
912,KNIGHT,912,It's all we have.
913,TAUPIN,913,Go to hell.
914,KNIGHT,914,"Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like
to play."
915,TAUPIN,915,Leave her alone.
916,KNIGHT,916,Get up.
917,BRENNA,917,You bastard!
918,KNIGHT,918,Be silent.
919,BRENNA,919,Leave him alone.
920,KNIGHT,920,You will be silent!!
921,KNIGHT,921,"I do hope you're enjoying this
as much as me."
922,KNIGHT,922,Get out.
923,KNIGHT,923,This is nothing that concerns you.
924,KNIGHT,924,You will leave!
925,TAUPIN,925,Don't.
926,TAUPIN,926,Stop.  You don't understand.
927,TAUPIN,927,"In mamus tuas Domine commendo
spiritum meum.  Auditorium nostrum
in nomine Domine."
928,TAUPIN,928,Requiescant in pace.
929,BRENNA,929,My God.
930,BRENNA,930,Conor.
931,KNIGHT,931,And now you know.
932,BRENNA,932,What's wrong?
933,TAUPIN,933,"I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't
stand it!"
934,TAUPIN,934,"The scream of your blood.  The
shriek of trees.  Stop it!  Stop it!"
935,BRENNA,935,What is it?
936,TAUPIN,936,"I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the
_last one_!"
937,TAUPIN,937,Get out.
938,BRENNA,938,No!
939,TAUPIN,939,"I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed
everything I've ever touched!  Oh
God..."
940,BRENNA,940,Conor...
941,TAUPIN,941,_Get out_!
942,BRENNA,942,What are we supposed to say?
943,TAUPIN,943,"The emptyness.  The years and years
of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only
by the quest for ultimate nothingness.
Who would have guessed?"
944,BRENNA,944,The inheritance.
945,TAUPIN,945,Not power.  Not control.
946,TAUPIN,946,"Life.  It is the gift and the under-
standing of life."
947,BRENNA,947,You have lived forever.
948,TAUPIN,948,"Life is only life when it is bounded
by death.  The inheritance is death.
The gift is the finality of life.
To be part of the fabric.  The inside."
949,TAUPIN,949,I love you Brenna.
950,TAUPIN,950,"It will be horrible.  The future.  I
may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows.
I can promise you nothing.  Nothing
but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment
of love, is that not worth a lifetime?"
951,BRENNA,951,Yes.
952,TAUPIN,952,"It's taken me so long.  So very
long."
