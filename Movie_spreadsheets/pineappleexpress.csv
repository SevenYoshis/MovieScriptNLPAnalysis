0,GENERAL BRAT,0,When did it start?
1,SCIENTIST,1,At 05:00. We're seven minutes in.
2,SCIENTIST,2,"Private Miller, we are now going to ask
you several questions. How do you feel?"
3,PRIVATE MILLER,3,"Uh, I feel a little queer sir. But...
It's good. Good queer."
4,PRIVATE MILLER,4,"Sir. Good queer, Sir."
5,PRIVATE MILLER (CONT'D),5,"But...uh...even though I feel queer, Sir,
I should mention that I'm also feeling
quite gay...so, a little queer, but
mostly gay."
6,SCIENTIST,6,"Private Miller. When you think of your
superiors, what emotions do you feel?"
7,PRIVATE MILLER,7,This went out...Sir.
8,SCIENTIST,8,"We will send someone in. Now answer the
question."
9,SCIENTIST (CONT'D) (O.S),9,Private Miller? Answer the question.
10,PRIVATE MILLER,10,Oh...um...what was the question again?
11,SCIENTIST (O.S.),11,"What are your emotions towards your
superiors?"
12,PRIVATE MILLER,12,COUGH   COUGH  Fucking shit.
13,PRIVATE MILLER,13,"Well, now that I think of it, it's
strange that they are called my
`superiors'. Does that make me their
`inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked
up."
14,GENERAL BRAT,14,"I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the
hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him.
This never happened."
15,PRIVATE MILLER,15,"Hey! What the...what are you guys doing!
Let go of me!"
16,PRIVATE MILLER,16,Sir!!! Sir!!! Help me!!!
17,GENERAL,17,"This is General Brat. We've reached a
final conclusion on Item 9."
18,GENERAL,18,Illegal.
19,TALK RADIO DJ,19,"Well, let's look at the facts.
Financially, coins are better because
they're cheaper, and environmentally,
forget-about-it, coins win hands down.
For those just joining us, we're with
caller Dale Denton discussing if America
should lose the paper dollar bill."
20,DALE,20,"Of course not! Who wants a pocket full of
coins? Seriously. Weighs down your pants,
clangs around. With all this unnecessary
new security everywhere, we'll be setting
off alarms left and right!"
21,TALK RADIO DJ,21,"We certainly do, Mr. Denton. Crude, but
to the point. Next caller!"
22,WOMAN,22,"Um, I didn't order a pizza."
23,DALE,23,"Excuse me, miss? Are you Sandra Danby"
24,WOMAN,24,Uh...yea-
25,DALE,25,"Sorry, miss, but you've failed to show up
to your divorce proceedings 4 times under
court order. You've been served."
26,WOMAN,26,"Oh great! Thanks a lot asshole! Real
clever! Go fuck yourself!"
27,TALK RADIO DJ 2,27,"...forget about Area 51, Roswell
sightings, Atlantis and the Boogie Man,
let's talk about real threats, threats to
our home and security..."
28,DALE,28,Fuckin' eh.
29,DALE (CONT'D),29,Nice! Hot Steppa!
30,DALE (CONT'D),30,"You think you know, chico/I know what Bo,
don't know/touch them up and go - uh oh!/
Chi-chi-ching-chang!!!"
31,SECRETARY,31,Can I help you?
32,DALE,32,Just here to check out some units.
33,WALTER (O.S.),33,Come in.
34,WALTER (CONT'D),34,"Oh! Hey there. Are you here to fix the
fax machines?"
35,DALE,35,Nope.
36,DALE (CONT'D),36,"You owe American Express $4068 dollars.
Sorry, but you've been served."
37,RADIO DJ 3,37,What gives you the right to say that?
38,DALE,38,"Everything! They should be able to
collect garbage TWICE a week. Why not?"
39,DALE (CONT'D),39,"As a tax payer, can't I say that? Come
get my garbage a bit more! Is that so f-
ing crazy? I'm not asking for free beer
Tuesday's or anything. And the whole city
would be more aesthetically pleasing and
smell better. And don't pretend you can't
smell it. Ever been to New York? Great
place, smells like piss, though."
40,DALE (CONT'D),40,"Twice a week,  cough  might fix that."
41,DALE (CONT'D),41,Hold on one sec.
42,DALE,42,"I need Dr. Terrence, immediately."
43,RECEPTIONIST,43,Of course. One moment.
44,DR. TERRENCE,44,"Hi there, I don't think we've met, I'm-"
45,DALE,45,"Dr. Edgar Terrence. You're the guy who
repeatedly refused to take care of the
monkey tree that spills onto your
neighbors property. And now, because of
that, you've been served."
46,TALK RADIO DJ,46,"...stay in your own country. Five simple
words. And stay the hell out of mine! I'm
not a racist, per se, but I'm not some
hippy tree humper."
47,DALE,47,"Let me through, damnit."
48,CORBER,48,My name's Corber.
49,DALE,49,You're Joshua Aaron Corber?
50,CORBER,50,"Get out of town! Clarice did this, didn't
she? I was just telling her before I left
how I've never been in a limo. Can you
believe it? 35 and I've never been in a
limo. Man! It's not stretched, is it?"
51,DALE,51,"Sorry, but you've been served."
52,CORBER,52,Ah fuck!
53,CORBER,53,Fuck! You fucking asshole!!! FUCK!
54,DALE,54,Hey! Nice. New chicken fries.
55,RADIO DJ,55,...3:09 in the PM and we-
56,ANGIE,56,Dale!
57,ANGIE (CONT'D),57,Mmm. Minty.
58,ANGIE'S MALE FRIEND,58,Yo Dale. `sup.
59,DALE,59,Hey Kyle.
60,DALE,60,"So, should we head back to my place and
finish up the trilogy? Matrix:
Revolution. Whose it gonna be, Angie? Man
or machine?"
61,ANGIE,61,"Of course. But can we just head to my
locker first? I left some stuff by
mistake."
62,DALE,62,Sure.
63,ANGIE,63,"So, are you going to come over for dinner
tomorrow, `cause my parents are beginning
to think I made you up."
64,DALE,64,"Well, yeah, I really want to meet them.
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...let me
think."
65,ANGIE,65,"You don't have to feel weird about it.
They know how old you are and they're
fine with it. They just want to meet you
and see that you're a cool guy and that
I'm not dating you just because you're
older."
66,DALE,66,"Of course. I know that. It's
just...tomorrow's tight. I've got a whole
bunch of cases that I can finish
tomorrow. It's probably going to take me
into the night."
67,ANGIE,67,"Fuck. Well, then you have to just come
over sometime this week or something,
okay? `Cause it's getting weird for them."
68,DALE,68,"I will. I promise. I'm not trying to
avoid this, for real, I've just been
crazy busy."
69,TEACHER,69,Hello? Can I help you?
70,DALE,70,Pardon?
71,TEACHER,71,"You can't just waltz in here and hit on
the students. Get out now before I-"
72,ANGIE,72,"Mr. Edwards, he's my boyfriend."
73,MR. EDWARDS,73,"This is your boyfriend? How old are you,
30?"
74,DALE,74,24.
75,MR. EDWARDS,75,And you're dating an 18 year old?
76,ANGIE,76,I'm 19. I moved here from Morocco.
77,MR. EDWARDS,77,"Alright, well this school is for students
and faculty only. Friends can't just stop
by."
78,DALE,78,"Dude, you may be a teacher here, but
we're about the same age, so don't get
all high and mighty. It's not that weird.
Frankly, it's natural."
79,MR. EDWARDS,79,"Well, in that case, get off school
property or I'm calling the Police
Liaison officer. Angie, no offense to
you, but if this guy's dating someone
your age, it's because nobody his age
will date him."
80,HANDSOME STUDENT,80,"Hey Angie. You were hilarious in drama
today."
81,DALE,81,I'll wait in the car.
82,ANGIE,82,"So, do you want to get some food?"
83,DALE,83,"No...actually I can't. I have to go serve
a guy."
84,ANGIE,84,Now?
85,DALE,85,"Yeah. It sucks. I'm sorry. We can hang
out later though. You can come over."
86,ANGIE,86,We'll see if Neo is truly the one.
87,SAUL (O.S.),87,Yo?
88,DALE,88,"Yo. It's Dale. Mind if I come by and pick
up some shit?"
89,DALE,89,"What's up, Saul."
90,SAUL,90,What the fuck?!?
91,DALE,91,What?
92,SAUL,92,"I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did
you get in here?"
93,DALE,93,"Whoa...sorry, man. someone just let me
in. I-"
94,SAUL,94,"That's fucked up, man! This building is
filled with fuckin' assholes. What else
is the buzzer for? Fuck."
95,DALE,95,"I'll buzz next time, man. I'm real sorry.
I'm just not familiar with your,
uh...protocol yet."
96,SAUL,96,"Hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro.
We're always cool. It's those fuckin'
jaggoffs."
97,DALE,97,Um...sure.
98,SAUL,98,"Brass tacs. I've got this new bud.
Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but
fortunately, it's hands down the dopest
fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've
smoked some dope fuckin' shit."
99,DALE,99,Better than that Blue Oyster weed?
100,SAUL,100,"Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue
Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had
a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest
Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso
Snowflake had a baby, and then by some
miracle those babies met, and fucked -
then this would be the shit they'd birth."
101,SAUL (CONT'D),101,Smell it.
102,DALE,102,What is this? It's spectacular.
103,SAUL,103,"It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red
told me it's when this Hawaiian flood
takes special dirt to the weed or some
shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the
only guy in the whole city who has it.
And, its only ten bones more for a
quarter."
104,DALE,104,So...can I get a quarter?
105,SAUL,105,No doubt. Just let me grab my scale.
106,SAUL (CONT'D),106,What's with the look? What?
107,DALE,107,Where's the scale?
108,SAUL,108,Oh shit! The scale. Be right back.
109,SAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D),109,"You know what's weird? How sometimes,
your brain just chooses to like, not keep
things in it, you know?"
110,SAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D),110,Fucking scale.
111,SAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D),111,Shit. Where is it?
112,DALE,112,Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing?
113,SAUL,113,"Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen
one of these? Not surprising. They are,
like, the apex of the vortex of joint
engineering. NASA built the first one in
the eighties."
114,DALE,114,You can actually smoke that contraption?
115,SAUL,115,"You light all three ends at the same
time, then, you smoke it as it resonates
the main section, creating a ""trifecta""
of smoking power. It's like, three times
as powerful as a normal joint."
116,DALE,116,"Well, be careful with that thing."
117,SAUL,117,"Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with
me?"
118,SAUL (CONT'D),118,I can't even light it on my own.
119,DALE,119,"Wow. So like, uh...so like, so like what
do I do?"
120,SAUL,120,"Alright. Firstly you light these two
ends. Then I will light the tip, making
the trifecta complete. Are you ready?"
121,DALE,121,Holy...
122,SAUL,122,"It's...uh, it's good to cough.  COUGH  It
opens the  COUGH  capillaries...gets you
twenty-five percent higher."
123,SAUL (CONT'D),123,"And that, combined with the pineapple
weed, and the cross-joint  COUGH  you're
a good thirty to forty times higher. I
don't know the exact math, but, pff,
you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You
know what I mean?"
124,SAUL (CONT'D),124,"It's crazy. The better the weed, the more
I wish I could think of how to explain
what's so good about it, but the...uh,
the better it is, the less shit I can
think of in total, you know?"
125,SAUL (CONT'D),125,"Okay, so, like, you've been buying from
me for, like, a few months now and I
really gotta ask."
126,SAUL (CONT'D),126,What's with the suit?
127,DALE,127,I'm a process server.
128,SAUL,128,"You`re a servant? Like, a butler."
129,DALE,129,"No, process server."
130,DALE (CONT'D),130,"I'm hired to give people papers they
don't want. It's pretty much the easiest
job on earth."
131,SAUL,131,"Nice, man. Where'd you get that job?"
132,DALE,132,"Well...uh, I got a totally useless degree
two years ago, then I did nothing for a
year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked
me up."
133,DALE (CONT'D),133,"I got it pretty sweet, though. Today? I
smoked like five joints, gave out some
pieces of paper, and I ate some Burger
King-"
134,SAUL,134,"Hey man, did you get those new chicken
fries?"
135,DALE,135,"Yeah man. I'd get on that shit. They're
fucking mind blowing. So, then I hot-
boxed my car and then...got some action
from my girlfriend."
136,SAUL,136,Does she smoke pot?
137,DALE,137,A little. She's in high school.
138,SAUL,138,"That's fuckin' sweet! Ilegal love! You're
like Jerry Lee Lewis. I just read his
biography."
139,DALE,139,"No, no. She's 19."
140,SAUL,140,Oh. It's still cool I guess.
141,DALE,141,"Yeah, it's awesome, although I think
she's getting old enough where she's
realizing I don't do much. And these high
school guys these days. They're all
roided out and going to Harvard. Even on
my best days, I look like a fat, dumb
piece of shit next to them."
142,SAUL,142,"Whatever, man. It sounds like you got it
pretty good. I wish I had a job that
easy. Fuck."
143,DALE,143,"Dude...you've got, like, the actual
easiest job in the world."
144,SAUL,144,"Hey! You're right, man. I never thought
of it like that."
145,DALE,145,"You can actually do whatever the hell you
want. You get to sleep all day and people
come buy weed at night."
146,SAUL,146,"That's totally true. Except tomorrow.
Thanks to that bitch daylight savings, I
gotta go change my grandma's clocks
forward at 7am. Or 8am. I seriously can't
figure it out."
147,DALE,147,Sorry to hear that.
148,SAUL,148,"Yo, so, like, what have these people done
that you go after?"
149,DALE,149,Let's see...tonight I'm going after-
150,DALE (CONT'D),150,Ted Jones. He forgot to pay his-
151,SAUL,151,"Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a
Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in
town. Maybe it's him!"
152,DALE,152,"I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot
of Ted Joneses's out there."
153,SAUL,153,"Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's
what I want to be one day. He's like the
""Jesus of Weed"". So...I guess he's like
Jah. Or Scarface."
154,DALE,154,"Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks."
155,SAUL,155,"No worries dude, peace."
156,DALE,156,Oh shit on me.
157,TED,157,Pineapple Express.
158,SAUL,158,Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech.
159,SAUL (CONT'D),159,Fucking hell.
160,SAUL (CONT'D),160,Hello?
161,DALE (O.C.),161,"...me in! Let me in! Let me in!    Let me
in! It's Dale! Let m--"
162,SAUL,162,Denton? Dale Denton?
163,DALE (O.C.),163,"...the love of shit, let me in! Pleeea-"
164,SAUL,164,"...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you
can't handle it."
165,SAUL (CONT'D),165,"Dude, whoa. What the fuck are-"
166,DALE,166,"He fucking killed him, man!"
167,SAUL,167,"Be quiet, man, I got neighbors-"
168,DALE,168,He killed him!
169,SAUL,169,Somebody killed somebody?!?
170,DALE,170,"Yeah, man! I can't believe it. A cop! A
lady, and a guy."
171,SAUL,171,"Somebody killed a cop, a lady and a guy?"
172,DALE,172,No! A guy!
173,SAUL,173,A cop killed a guy?
174,DALE,174,"No! A cop and a guy killed   another guy!
The lady and the guy...No,   a fucking
woman, a police woman, and   an old guy,
shot a guy, a younger guy,   in the fucking
window at Ted's house!"
175,SAUL,175,Was the guy Ted?
176,DALE,176,Which guy?
177,SAUL,177,"I don't know, the old guy who shot the
guy?"
178,DALE,178,"I don't fucking know. He was this big,
old, grey haired guy with a gun, and he
fucking took him, and he shot him! Right
there in the fucking window! BAM!"
179,SAUL,179,I heard Ted's got grey hair!
180,DALE,180,"And they saw me! They saw me see them
shoot the guy!"
181,SAUL,181,"What!?! They saw you?!? Why the fuck did
you come here? Did they follow you?!?"
182,SAUL (CONT'D),182,Did they follow you here!?!
183,DALE,183,"No! I panicked. I was having a coughing
fit, I crashed, I crashed into a car.
Fuck, two cars. They must've heard at
least. They knew someone was there."
184,SAUL,184,But they don't know it's you?
185,DALE,185,No. I don't think so. No.
186,SAUL,186,So...they're not coming here?
187,SAUL (CONT'D),187,"Cool. So, what's your game-plan? You
gonna call the cops? Cause if you do, I'd
appreciate it if you left my shit out of
this shit."
188,DALE,188,"I'm not calling the cops - one of them
was a cop. They could all be cops!"
189,SAUL,189,Did you see any blood? Was it sick?
190,DALE,190,Yeah. I saw some blood.
191,SAUL,191,I wonder who the guy he shot was?
192,DALE,192,"I don't know, who do drug dealers kill?
It was probably another drug dealer. He
was Asian. Are there Asian drug dealers."
193,SAUL,193,"Hell yeah, man. The Koreans teamed up
with, like, the Vietnamese or some shit.
They're crazy mother fuckers. Number two
in town."
194,SAUL,194,"Heh. Ted's cappin' the competition. Yo,
you want some of this?"
195,SAUL (CONT'D),195,"So, like, exactly what was the sequence
of happenings?"
196,DALE,196,"I'm sitting across from Ted's smoking a
massive joint of that weed you sold me-"
197,SAUL,197,"Oh, the Pineapple Express. It's so rare
it's almost a shame to smoke it, like
killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb."
198,DALE,198,When I threw it...out...the window...
199,SAUL,199,What?
200,DALE,200,This weed is actually that rare?
201,SAUL,201,"Yeah, it's like, ""the rarest""."
202,DALE,202,"So, you are actually the only guy in town
with this weed?"
203,SAUL,203,"Fuckin' rights, I am. Red told me he was
giving me an ""exclusive sneak preview""."
204,DALE,204,And am I the only guy you gave it to?
205,SAUL,205,"Yeah. So, we're the only guys."
206,DALE,206,"But, like, another dealer, couldn't
identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if
they found a roach of it, right?"
207,SAUL,207,I could. Why?
208,DALE,208,"We should go, we shouldn't be here! We
should go!"
209,SAUL,209,"No...seriously, why?"
210,DALE,210,"I left a roach of this weed in front of
Ted's house!"
211,SAUL,211,"So what? I leave roaches all over fucking
town."
212,DALE,212,"No, listen - they could find the roach
and say, ""This is pineapple weed, Saul's
the only guy in town who has pineapple
weed, therefore he must have witnessed
the murder or know who did - let's go
kill him."""
213,SAUL,213,Mother of fuck!
214,SAUL (CONT'D),214,Let's go!
215,DALE,215,Wait!
216,SAUL,216,"Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck
out of here!"
217,DALE,217,"Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need,
like your weed and money and stuff."
218,DALE (CONT'D),218,"Are you sure you're not forgetting
anything?"
219,SAUL,219,Yes! Come on!
220,SAUL,220,Fuck! I forgot something!
221,SAUL (CONT'D),221,"Dude, I was so scared going back, I
thought there was gonna be guys there,
and then you'd be gone, and there was
this music in my head-"
222,DALE,222,"We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster."
223,DALE (CONT'D),223,Go back! Go back!
224,DALE (CONT'D),224,"Okay, man. We gotta try to relax."
225,SAUL,225,Why?!?
226,DALE,226,We don't want to draw attention.
227,SAUL,227,"Whose attention!?! You think they could
be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?!"
228,DALE,228,"I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be
cool."
229,SAUL,229,What the fuck was that?
230,DALE,230,That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm!
231,DALE (CONT'D),231,Oh. Pardon.
232,MATHESON,232,Look.
233,BUDLOFSKY,233,"Ted? He's gone, but he was just here. I
think he knew we were coming."
234,DALE,234,"Okay, what do you know about Ted?"
235,SAUL,235,"What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's
tracking us with space satellites right
now! He's got grey hair, that's all I
knew."
236,SAUL (CONT'D),236,Let's go to your place.
237,DALE,237,"No way! What if they did see my license
plate!?!"
238,SAUL,238,"Okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a
motel, or a Holiday Inn."
239,DALE,239,"Well, how much money do we have?"
240,SAUL,240,"All I've got is the seventy-five you gave
me."
241,DALE,241,That's it!?!
242,SAUL,242,"Well, how much money do you have?"
243,DALE,243,Uh...nine bucks.
244,SAUL,244,"Well, shut up then! I've got more than
you!"
245,DALE,245,Fine. Forget the hotel.
246,SAUL,246,I wish we could just go nowhere.
247,DALE,247,Okay...where's nowhere?
248,DALE,248,"So what do we know? Nothing. We may or
may not be followed because we don't even
know if he found the roach or not. And,
we could just be completely crazy. But,
the question is this: even if he found
the roach, how could he know where you
were?"
249,SAUL,249,"He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's
impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on
the bottom of the car or some shit, but I
mean-"
250,DALE,250,"No, what I mean is, if Ted found the
roach and identified the weed, how could
he connect it to you?"
251,SAUL,251,"There's no way. He could only find out
from Red."
252,DALE,252,Who is this Red guy?
253,SAUL,253,"Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted
and guys like me. And we're mad fucking
tight. One time he convinced some girl he
knew to give me a hand-job within, like,
five minutes of me meeting her."
254,DALE,254,"But let's say someone calls asking who he
sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say
you, because...why wouldn't he?"
255,SAUL,255,"Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have
called me if that happened. A hand-job,
Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand
job by now!"
256,DALE,256,"Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug
dealer."
257,SAUL,257,"So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you
don't trust me then?"
258,DALE,258,"Um...I...call him. Yeah, sure, call him."
259,SAUL,259,Thank you!
260,DALE,260,"You're right. You are. I'm just being
paranoid. Sorry, dude."
261,RED (O.S.),261,Ow! Hello?
262,SAUL,262,"Yo, Red. You okay man?"
263,RED (O.S.),263,"Saul! Oh. I, uh...stubbed my toe."
264,SAUL,264,"Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the
house. But Red, I gotta get straight to
brass tacs, I need a favor."
265,RED (O.S.),265,"Sure man, anything. I'm Red."
266,SAUL,266,"You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know
how you gave me some of that pineapple
express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave
it to me."
267,RED (O.S.),267,"Sure man, no problem. Red swears it,
hombre."
268,SAUL,268,"So, can I come on over now?"
269,DALE,269,No! We should do it tomorrow!
270,SAUL,270,"I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's
just go and get this shit over with."
271,DALE,271,"Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared
shitless. I want to think things through
before I do anything. Let's go in the
morning. Please."
272,SAUL,272,"Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in
the day."
273,SAUL (CONT'D),273,Red?
274,RED (O.S.),274,"-I can hear him talking to someone, so-
Yo! Saul? So, you're gonna come by in the
morning?"
275,SAUL,275,"Yeah, right after I see my grandma."
276,RED (O.S.),276,"Sure, your Grandma's retirement home- Ow!
Fuckin' stupid god-damn toe. I, uh, is
that the one on Granville and 41st."
277,SAUL,277,"Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be
chillin' by noon."
278,RED (O.S.),278,"Well, cool brother. Noon it is."
279,SAUL,279,"We should definitely hit up the casino
again sometime."
280,RED (O.S.),280,"For sure. We should definitely hit up the
casino."
281,SAUL,281,"Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone
cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the
house."
282,"MATHESON
BUDLOFSKY",282,"Why isn't he coming now? What did you
say?"
283,RED,283,"I didn't say shit, man! There was another
guy there and he said tomorrow!"
284,MATHESON,284,"Why did he mention the casino? The Asians
run the casinos. Is Saul Asian?"
285,RED,285,"No, man!"
286,MATHESON,286,This might be more than we thought.
287,BUDLOFSKY,287,"Than you thought. I thought it would be
more than you did. I'll call Ted."
288,SAUL,288,"I always liked smoking weed in the
forest."
289,DALE,289,"I'm going to go call Angie. Make up some
bull shit."
290,SAUL,290,Dale...wait!
291,SAUL (CONT'D),291,"Yeah, the phone...I mean, I don't know
how this shit works, but...can cops...
you said they might be cops...could they
triangulate our phones or trace `em or
some shit like that? I don't know. I feel
like I've seen that."
292,SAUL (CONT'D),292,"I mean, shit Dale, maybe they can trace
them when we're not even on them!"
293,DALE,293,What the fuck is that?!
294,DALE (CONT'D),294,"Are we on fucking ""Lost""?! What the hell
is that?!"
295,SAUL,295,It's them!!!
296,SAUL (CONT'D),296,Holy fuck. That was close.
297,DALE,297,"You know what? You're right. We should
just get rid of them. We should just
smash `em."
298,DALE (CONT'D),298,"Fuck. I just bought this thing. Maybe I
can just take the batteries out?"
299,SAUL,299,No! Smash it!
300,SAUL (CONT'D),300,Shit!
301,DALE,301,What the fuck was that?!
302,SAUL,302,"Fuck! I was trying to throw it at that
tree!"
303,DALE,303,What tree?
304,SAUL,304,That one.
305,SAUL (CONT'D),305,"It was a cheap piece of shit. Came free
with the plan. It must've smashed when it
landed."
306,DALE,306,"Who the fuck knows?!? I don't know!! Why
couldn't you have just smashed it on a
rock like a normal person?"
307,SAUL,307,"I was trying to smash it! How often does
a guy smash things? I'm rusty. Fuck."
308,DALE,308,Did you at least see where it landed?
309,SAUL,309,"Over there, somewhere. Wait! We could
call it!"
310,DALE,310,With what? I just smashed my phone!
311,SAUL,311,"Man, it's not like they got McGuyver
workin' on the case. I bet they can't
even triangulate it."
312,DALE,312,"Well, then you shouldn't have said
anything, cause now you've convinced me
that they can!"
313,SAUL,313,"Fine! Fine. Let's just find the stupid
thing and get back to doing what we were
doin'."
314,DALE,314,Do you see it?
315,SAUL,315,"Dude, this is the scariest place I've
ever been in my life."
316,SAUL (CONT'D),316,"You ever see that movie where all the
people are in the woods and they slowly
get killed?"
317,DALE,317,"The ""Blair Witch Project."""
318,SAUL,318,"No...Shit. That one's way scarier than
the one I was thinking of. Mine had
Arnold Shwartzenegger in it. Now I'm
thinking of the fucking Blair Witch."
319,DALE,319,Stop!
320,SAUL,320,What-
321,DALE,321,Sshh!
322,SAUL,322,What is-
323,DALE,323,Sshh! Can you hear that?
324,SAUL,324,What?
325,DALE,325,Just listen.
326,SAUL,326,I literally hear nothing.
327,SAUL,327,Wait...
328,DALE,328,SAUL!!!
329,SAUL(O.S.),329,ARGHHH!!!
330,DALE,330,Shit.
331,DALE (CONT'D),331,AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
332,SAUL,332,Let me in! Let me in!
333,SAUL (CONT'D),333,Let's go! Go!
334,DALE,334,Is there anyone even out there?!?
335,SAUL,335,I don't know!
336,DALE,336,"If you don't know then why the hell did
you run like that?!?"
337,SAUL,337,"I don't know! I'm freaking out, man!
Let's just go!"
338,DALE,338,No! We're not going anywhere!
339,SAUL,339,But there could be something out there!
340,DALE,340,"There's nothing out there, that's why
we're here. God, man, you scared the
fucking shit out of me."
341,SAUL,341,"Well, I'm not getting out of the car. I'm
staying in the car."
342,RADIO DJ,342,"-white accent walls would go nice with a
dark colored room, say a burnt sienna,
but don't forget..."
343,SAUL,343,"Talk radio? You fuckin' joshin' me? Why
don't we just shoot ourselves in the
nuts?"
344,DALE,344,"Shut up, okay? It's my car."
345,SAUL,345,"Fine. Well, I'm going to smoke a joint
before I go to sleep, and don't worry
about it, even though you're being a
dick, it's on the house."
346,DALE,346,"Don't do me any fucking favors. I got my
own."
347,SAUL,347,Thanks to me!
348,DALE,348,Shut up.
349,DALE,349,Saul. Saul. Get up. Wake up.
350,SAUL,350,Fuck me.
351,DALE,351,What's the time?
352,SAUL,352,It's too early.
353,SAUL (CONT'D),353,It's...
354,SAUL (CONT'D),354,This can't be right.
355,DALE,355,What does it say?
356,SAUL,356,"It says, uh..."
357,SAUL (CONT'D),357,"It couldn't be three in the morning,
could it?"
358,DALE,358,"It's three o'clock!?! We were supposed to
be there at noon!"
359,SAUL,359,"Wait! My grandma's clocks! It's daylight
savings!"
360,SAUL,360,"Fuck! No! They go forwards an hour!
Dammit-"
361,DALE,361,It's four o'fucking clock?!
362,SAUL,362,"-I didn't go to my Grandma's! Fuck! And
we've gotta call Red."
363,DALE,363,How?
364,SAUL,364,"We'll find a pay pho...fuck! His number
was in my phone!"
365,DALE,365,"You remember where he lives, right?"
366,SAUL,366,"Yes, I remember. What the hell is that
supposed to mean? Are you insinuating I'm
forgetful? That's right, I know the word
insinuating."
367,DALE,367,Let's just get out of here.
368,DALE (CONT'D),368,What the fuck? Come on.
369,DALE (CONT'D),369,I think the battery's dead.
370,SAUL,370,Are you fucking serious?
371,DALE,371,It's dead.
372,SAUL,372,It's dead?
373,SAUL (CONT'D),373,"What the fuck happened? How did this
happen?"
374,DALE,374,How? We fell asleep!
375,SAUL,375,"Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No
surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put
people to sleep."
376,DALE,376,"We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll
walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's."
377,SAUL,377,For real?
378,DALE,378,"Yeah, ""for real"". We'll be late, but
we'll get there. Then we can fix this
insane situation."
379,DALE (CONT'D),379,"Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave
that thing alone."
380,SAUL,380,"It's like, my thumb is my cock!"
381,SAUL,381,"Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid."
382,DALE,382,"So, what's this guy like?"
383,SAUL,383,"I don't know. He's short...and stout. So
he's like a tea pot. Hehe."
384,DALE,384,"Well, do you think he'll be there?"
385,SAUL,385,"I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight
hours late."
386,SAUL,386,That's actually pretty late.
387,RED (O.S.),387,Who is it?
388,SAUL,388,Red! It's Saul. Open up.
389,RED,389,Who's this guy?
390,DALE,390,Dale. Nice to meet you.
391,RED,391,Dale who?
392,DALE,392,"I think it's    better if you don't know my
last-"
393,SAUL,393,Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries.
394,RED,394,"What happened to your clothes? Where'd
you call me from, man?"
395,SAUL,395,"We were in the forest laying low.
Thinking."
396,DALE,396,"Uh, Red...what...uh, is your lip okay?"
397,SAUL,397,"Whoa! Dude, have you been crying?"
398,RED,398,"What? Oh, I uh..."
399,RED,399,"...I got a cold sore, I've never got one
before. I started crying."
400,SAUL,400,A cold sore? Is that fucking herpes?
401,RED,401,"...uh, yeah, man."
402,SAUL,402,"Ewwww! That's sick, man. Do you know how
many joints we've shared? I told you,
man. This is from that time you ate the
lollypop straight from the strippers sna-"
403,SAUL,403,(to Dale)
404,SAUL,404,"Awesome! Look at that! Everything's fine.
We had a crazy night in the woods, which
I assume we can both put behind us like
grown ups, and now we can use Red's giant
bong to get super-duper high."
405,RED,405,"Alright, well, wicked. Make yourselves at
home. I'm just going to use the ol'
telephone-o."
406,RED (CONT'D),406,What the fuck!
407,DALE,407,I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
408,SAUL,408,Dale!   What the fuck are you doing?
409,DALE,409,"We can't let him call anyone! He's acting
weird!"
410,RED,410,Fuck you man - this is my house!
411,DALE,411,"I'm sorry. I just, I don't think I can-"
412,SAUL,412,"Dale! You fucking nut. You're stoned and
paranoid. Just chill the shit out, guy!"
413,SAUL,413,"I'm sorry, Red. I shouldn't have brought
this guy over here, he's a total lunatic."
414,DALE,414,AAAHHH!
415,SAUL,415,Holy cock!
416,SAUL (CONT'D),416,Dude! He's sorry! Wait!
417,SAUL (CONT'D),417,WHY!?!?!
418,SAUL (O.S.),418,"Dude, we're friends, what the fuck is
wrong with you? Ow! Dude! Are you fucked
off that shit again!?! Ow!"
419,RED (O.S.),419,"I have to! They'll kill me!!! Please
don't fight!"
420,SAUL,420,AAAHHHHHH!!!
421,SAUL,421,"Why, man!?! Why!"
422,RED,422,I'M SORRY!!!
423,DALE,423,He's going for the phone! Bathroom!
424,DALE,424,SAUL!!! Phone!!!
425,SAUL,425,"What the fuck Red!?! What the fuck is
going on!?!"
426,RED,426,"I don't know!!! They're going to kill
me!!!"
427,SAUL,427,"You didn't stub your toe, did you?"
428,DALE,428,Now tell us-
429,RED,429,They're gonna come back and kill me!!!
430,SAUL,430,DALE! HELP!
431,SAUL (CONT'D),431,"Red, you motherfucker."
432,DALE,432,"It's happening! It's actually happening!
He knows my name! Red knows my name!"
433,SAUL,433,"We should beat it out of his sellout
brains. You're a shitty friend, Red! Fuck
the Casino! Go alone!"
434,DALE,434,"This is fucked, what do we do now, he
knows my name!?!"
435,SAUL,435,He knows my name too!
436,DALE,436,Well what do we do? He's gonna tell them!
437,SAUL,437,"We're not gonna have to kill him, are we?
I don't think I could do that."
438,SAUL (CONT'D),438,"Maybe we could talk him into killing
himself, or, like, make him promise not
to tell."
439,DALE,439,"Well, we have to find out what he knows."
440,RED,440,"I don't know anything...you broke my
bong..."
441,DALE,441,Tell us everything. Now!
442,SAUL,442,"Don't look at me, you sellout bastard.
Now start talking!"
443,RED,443,I can't...I don't know anything.
444,SAUL,444,What do we do? He's not gonna talk.
445,DALE,445,I think we beat it out of him.
446,SAUL,446,For real?
447,DALE,447,"Okay. Red. Here's the deal: if you don't
tell us everything, we're going to beat
you up."
448,RED,448,"Don't beat me up! Saul, dude, I'm Red!"
449,SAUL,449,You were Red. Now you're no one to me.
450,DALE,450,"You've got five seconds, okay? Ready?
Five, four-"
451,RED,451,Please don't.
452,DALE,452,"Three, two...one!"
453,RED,453,That didn't hurt.
454,SAUL,454,"You didn't even hurt him! Hit him hard,
man. Like, fucking hit him!"
455,RED,455,Wait! I...I...
456,RED (CONT'D),456,No!
457,RED (CONT'D),457,"Ow! Fuck, man! Stop it.
Listen...two...two guys came here,
they...they were here when you called-"
458,SAUL,458,Seriously?
459,DALE,459,Who were they?
460,RED,460,"They work for Ted. Budlofsky and
Matheson. Fuckin' crazy weird guys. They
were here all day, but you guys didn't
show. They said they'd kill me if I
didn't bring you to them, they said I'd-"
461,DALE,461,"How many cops does he have in his...uh,
payroll, or whatever?"
462,RED,462,"I know there's this lady cop. He could
have more, I don't know. He's got pretty
crazy connections. He's also got a cool-
ass hideout. It's crazy man."
463,RED (CONT'D),463,"Listen, I-"
464,DALE,464,Who's his competition?
465,RED,465,The Asians!
466,DALE,466,"Asians? Which Asians? Indians are
technically Asian."
467,RED,467,"The...the Koreans, I think. Everyone just
calls them the Asians."
468,SAUL,468,What else?
469,RED,469,"I swear to god that's all I know...I
swear..."
470,DALE,470,"Alright. We should...tie him up and...and
get the fuck out of here."
471,SAUL,471,"I made a gravity bong here once. I know
where his duct tape is."
472,SAUL (CONT'D),472,"Come on, let's tape this piece of shit
up."
473,SAUL (CONT'D),473,I can't find the edge.
474,DALE,474,What?
475,SAUL,475,"I can't find the, oh...wait..."
476,SAUL (CONT'D),476,Shit. They're actually here to kill him.
477,DALE,477,What do we do?
478,SAUL,478,I don't know.
479,DALE,479,"Fuck. Oh, man."
480,RED,480,"Guys, guys...listen to me-"
481,RED (CONT'D),481,"I'm fuckin' sorry. Okay? I fucked up. I'm
a son-of-a-bitch. I forgot bros before
hoes, even though these guys aren't hoes.
You know what I mean. But I can fix this."
482,RED (CONT'D),482,"I know these guys, it's cool. Just head
out the back, I'll stall `em. Won't tell
`em nothing. You can count on me!"
483,SAUL,483,"Thanks, Red."
484,RED,484,"Dale Denton! It was Saul and some dude
named Dale Denton! They just ran out the
back!"
485,SAUL,485,In here!
486,DALE,486,No. I've got to get to a phone!
487,SAUL,487,We should hide!
488,DALE,488,"But, if Red tells Ted's guys my name,
then they'll go to my apartment and find
out about Angie!"
489,SAUL,489,I think we should stay!
490,DALE,490,Why?!
491,SAUL,491,"Because I'm in the dumpster already!
Shit! Fine!"
492,BUDLOFSKY,492,They're long gone.
493,TED (O.S.),493,Find out what he knows.
494,MATHESON,494,"Red, you gonna tell us anything helpful?"
495,RED,495,"I just did, Matheson. Fuckin' Dale
Denton's the other guys name. He was with
Saul, they kicked my ass. What more do
you want?"
496,MATHESON,496,You hear that?
497,TED,497,Ask if either of them were Asian.
498,MATHESON,498,Hey. What skin color were these guys?
499,RED,499,"What? Um...white, they're both white. I
think Denton might be a Jew, but I
couldn't really tell."
500,MATHESON,500,"You hear that, Ted?"
501,TED (O.S.),501,"Dale Denton. Not Asian. Alright. Kill
Red."
502,RED,502,"Oh fuck...you shot me, you motherfucker!
Fuckin' Matheson...fuck you! You've eaten
dinner here, man! Tacos! And now I'm
gonna fuckin' die from this, probably.
Get the fuck out of my house!"
503,TED,503,Fuck.
504,TED (CONT'D),504,"Carol, there's another name to run. Dale
Denton."
505,CAROL,505,"Does he have something to do with our
friend in there?"
506,TED,506,"If the Asians have the balls to send an
assassin right into my home, we can't be
too cautious. The boys say Denton and
Saul are Caucasian. Maybe after their
assassin failed, they hired this outside
guy Denton to finish the job."
507,TED,507,"Also, the boys said that Saul mentioned
""going to the casino."""
508,CAROL,508,"""Going to the casino""? I don't like that."
509,CAROL (O.S.),509,"I'll be back in an hour with everything
there is on Dale Denton. He'll be dead by
the time we make our pick-up tomorrow."
510,SAUL,510,"But my parents live   in Canada. You don't
think they're going   to go to Canada, do
you? How would they   get a Canadian phone
book even?"
511,DALE,511,"All I know is Angie's new number is on my
fridge and they could see that, so I have
to get to her."
512,SAUL,512,"My Grandma lives here. They wouldn't go
after her, would they? She's got a
different last name. Belogus."
513,ANSWERING MACHINE,513,""" cough  It's Dale. I'm probably at work,
maybe we'll talk later.  BEEP """
514,MATHESON,514,Budlofsky!
515,DALE,515,"Dude, stay here. I'll be back in a
minute."
516,SAUL,516,"Hells no! I don't want to be alone! I
want to go with you!"
517,DALE,517,"Saul, just watch my back. I'll literally
be five minutes. Please."
518,SAUL,518,Fine. But hurry.
519,DALE,519,Angie!
520,ANGIE,520,It's Dale! You came.
521,SHANNON,521,"Hi, Dale. Nice to meet you, sit down and
have some couscous. Can I get you a
drink?"
522,ROBERT,522,What the hell happened to you?
523,ANGIE,523,Dale?   What happened to you?
524,DALE,524,"Nothing, I was in the woods and..."
525,DALE,525,"...Hi, I'm Dale. Uh...it's nice to
finally meet you both...I apologize for
my appearance. Robert, Charlotte-"
526,SHANNON,526,Shannon.
527,DALE,527,"Yes! Shannon. I've heard a lot about both
of you."
528,DALE (CONT'D),528,Very nice things.
529,ANGIE,529,You were in the woods?
530,DALE,530,"Alright, now, here's what's happened -
I've been thrust into a kind of,
ah...situation. So, uh, if we could all
just start to evacuate..."
531,DALE (CONT'D),531,"...that'd be really, really good right
now. I'll answer all your-"
532,ANGIE,532,Is this a joke?
533,ROBERT,533,What is this Angie?
534,SHANNON,534,I think it is a joke.
535,DALE,535,"Listen. There are people after us and
they could come here. I'll tell you
anything you want, just please, let's go!"
536,ROBERT,536,He's serious?
537,DALE,537,"Yes, I'm serious. Super serious! We have
to get the ""F"" out of here!"
538,ROBERT,538,Get the hell out of my house.
539,DALE,539,"Okay, Mr. Anderson, look, here's the deal
- I saw a crooked cop kill a guy while I
was working...this morning. The cop shot
the guy then saw my car drive off, and I
think they might have seen my license
plate and, so, I ditched my car...in the
woods, so..."
540,SAUL,540,No fucking way.
541,ANGIE,541,Who are these people? Why are they-
542,DALE,542,I think their drug dealers.
543,ANGIE,543,Why?
544,DALE,544,"Well, it's complicated. See,
the...uh...it doesn't matter right now,
we just have to get out of here."
545,ANGIE,545,Let's go to the police!
546,DALE,546,"No, they are the police!"
547,ROBERT,547,I'm getting my gun.
548,SHANNON,548,Robert! No!
549,ROBERT,549,We bought it for a reason!
550,SAUL,550,"You... huff ...Angie? Dale! It's
happening!"
551,ANGIE,551,EEEHHHH!!!
552,SAUL,552,ARGGG!!!
553,ANGIE,553,"Dale, it's one of the drug dealers!!!"
554,SAUL,554,"No! I'm Dale's dealer, I'm S-"
555,DALE,555,Angie! Stop! It's Saul!
556,SHANNON,556,"What did you do, Angie?!"
557,SAUL,557,"Ow!! Fuck. Now I'm gonna need a tetanus
shot! They fuckin' kill. Fuck!"
558,ANGIE,558,"Saul? Dale, who is-"
559,SAUL,559,"Dale, they're coming!"
560,BUDLOFSKY,560,Fuck! What the hell?
561,MATHESON,561,Get out your fucking gun!
562,BUDLOFSKY,562,What the fuck is going on?
563,DALE,563,Stop! Stop! He's with me!
564,SAUL,564,"Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy
fuck!"
565,ANGIE,565,"Dad, put the gun down!"
566,SHANNON,566,"Robert, what's going on?"
567,ROBERT,567,"Just nobody move, okay? Except Shannon
and Angie. So, you two don't move!"
568,SHANNON,568,Oh my god.
569,DALE,569,"Sir, please, he's my friend, he's helping
me, he's-"
570,SAUL,570,"Stop shooting, man! I'm Dale's dealer"
571,DALE,571,"Guys! Please! We have to get out of here.
Robert, Angie...Mrs. Anderson-"
572,SAUL,572,It's Shannon.
573,DALE,573,"I know! Look, we have to get out of here.
I'm sure everything is going to be fine
but better safe than...not."
574,SHANNON,574,Is this...for real-
575,DALE,575,Yes. Terribly real.
576,MATHESON,576,Ready?
577,BUDLOFSKY,577,No. One sec.
578,MATHESON,578,Hurry the fuck up.
579,BUDLOFSKY,579,"Chill out, man. You're nagging isn't
helping."
580,MATHESON,580,"Ew! It's a bloody fork! What are these
people doing?"
581,SAUL,581,"Fuck. Look at that. Fuckin' mashed
potatoes in my wound."
582,ROBERT,582,"Baby! Get in the car quick. Angie, in the
car!"
583,ANGIE,583,Dale - get in the car!
584,ROBERT,584,You stay the fuck away from my family!
585,ANGIE,585,Shut up dad!
586,DALE,586,"I...I think it would be best if I didn't
go with you. I don't want to put you in
any more danger."
587,ANGIE,587,"What are you going to do? What should we
do?"
588,ROBERT,588,"Angie, get in the car!"
589,DALE,589,"Alright, baby. Here's the plan - go to
the Holiday Inn downtown and use a fake
name. Something like..."
590,DALE,590,Car...lyle.
591,ANGIE,591,Carlyle?
592,ANGIE,592,"I...I have so many questions. I
just...how can this be happening?
Where...where are you going?"
593,DALE,593,"I have to stop this. I don't know how,
but don't worry. I'll keep you safe."
594,DALE,594,"But still, watch your back. You never
know where they might be, whoever they
are."
595,DALE (CONT'D),595,I love you.
596,ANGIE,596,Uh...thanks.
597,DALE,597,"Um...you're welcome. And nice to meet you
guys."
598,SAUL,598,Why aren't we in that car?
599,DALE,599,"Let's run, man! Run!"
600,SAUL,600,Huff   Huff  Where are we running?
601,DALE,601,Somewhere we can think.
602,CAROL,602,A fork?
603,TED,603,"A bloody fork. In his girlfriends house.
And the blood was fresh."
604,CAROL,604,"Maybe he killed her, to protect himself."
605,TED,605,"Or maybe it's the Asians fucking with us.
What the fuck is going on!"
606,TED,606,Any luck with the cell phones?
607,CAROL,607,"They smashed one and left the other one
in the woods to distract us. Took us an
hour to find it. And we found Denton's
car, which was filled with all these
strange disguises. These guys are for
real."
608,TED,608,"I want to talk to the Asians. Get me
Cheung's number. Now."
609,CHEUNG,609,Hello?
610,TED,610,Cheung. It's Ted.
611,CHEUNG,611,Record this conversation.
612,CHEUNG (CONT'D),612,"Ted. This is surprising. What would you
like?"
613,TED,613,"Cheung, I want you to call off your man
Denton. I don't know what he is, a scout,
assassin, and frankly I don't care. I
just want him gone. I want him dead. If
you do this, I'll consider it a peace
offering, otherwise, you're asking for
war. And just in case you forgot, I'm
number one, and there's a reason for
that. You've got 24 hours to reply."
614,CHEUNG,614,"Ted Jones is slipping. Our assassin
failed to kill him, but it did rattle his
confidence. It's earlier than planned,
but we should strike now, while he is
confused. Let it be known-"
615,CHEUNG (CONT'D),615,-Li-Youngs death will not be in vain.
616,SAUL,616,Victory joint complete. Here ya go.
617,DALE,617,"""Tell us what you know!"" How fuckin'
balls was that?"
618,SAUL,618,"Like, really balls."
619,DALE,619,"And I think I fought pretty well, don't
you? You know, for my first time. We were
like Tango and Cash, man."
620,SAUL,620,Or Scarface!
621,DALE,621,"BOOM! Knocked the door right off it's
hinges!"
622,SAUL,622,"And you probably saved Angie, which is
fucking pimp."
623,DALE,623,"I probably couldn't have done it without
you. Thanks, man. It is fucking pimp."
624,SAUL,624,"We're in this together, right? So, ya
know."
625,DALE,625,"Thanks, man."
626,DALE,626,"You know, my last dealer was a total
dick. You're by far the coolest dealer
I've ever had."
627,SAUL,627,"Wow. Thanks, man. I seriously appreciate
that."
628,DALE,628,"Yeah...like, the time before last time, I
totally had weed. I just kind of wanted
to chill with you."
629,SAUL,629,"Really? That's awesome, man. That means a
lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes
come in to buy and pretend to be all
buddy-buddy with me, but in my head I'm
always, like, ""you don't like me, you
like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!"" You
know? And just so you know, I totally
could have lit that cross-joint on my
own. I'd just have to use candles, but,
like, I've never smoked one of those with
anyone before."
630,DALE,630,"So, do you think we should leave town? We
could just get on a bus and go, right?"
631,SAUL,631,"We only have, like, fifty bucks. I don't
think that could even pay for one ticket."
632,DALE,632,What about your sack?
633,SAUL,633,Oh man. It's still fucking killing me.
634,DALE,634,"No dude, your sack of weed. Can't we sell
some?"
635,SAUL,635,"Of course. That's my bread and butter. We
just have to go to a highschool. It's the
easiest market. Chester A. Arthur is
like, a block a way."
636,DALE,636,"No way, man. I'm not going to sell to
kids."
637,SAUL,637,"Why? They're gonna get it from somewhere.
I mean, we got it from guys like us."
638,DALE,638,"Well, then not kids at that school."
639,SAUL,639,"Well, there's a bunch of private ones
nearby, but they're into way crazier shit
than weed-"
640,DALE,640,"I can't do it, man. I'm not going to a
high school is there anywhere else we
could go?"
641,SAUL,641,We could go to Crackhead Park.
642,DALE,642,What's that?
643,SAUL,643,"It's a park. Really close, actually. Full
of crackheads. They smoke weed too,
though."
644,SAUL,644,"Hey, stop it. Stop it. You wanna buy some
weed, or, like, what?"
645,SAUL (CONT'D),645,"See, that's the problem around here.
Target demographic has a real, uh, fickle
attention span. You gotta wow `em."
646,SAUL (CONT'D),646,Hey! Who wants some weed!?!
647,DALE,647,Fuck this place.
648,SAUL,648,Yo. `sup. You guys want some chronic?
649,DALE,649,"Man, this is great."
650,DALE,650,ACK
651,DALE,651,WALT
652,DALE,652,ACK
653,DALE,653,BLAKE
654,DALE,654,DESMOND
655,DALE,655,ACK
656,DALE,656,WALT
657,DALE,657,ACK
658,DALE,658,WALT
659,DALE,659,DESMOND
660,DALE,660,Yeah. She's pretty sweet.
661,SAUL,661,"And we're all high, that's hilarious."
662,SAUL (CONT'D),662,"Alright gentlemen, it's time for me to
teach you some business. Brass tacs -
this is the best weed you've ever smoked,
agreed?"
663,SAUL (CONT'D),663,"So I'm gonna make this simple. How much
did you get between you?"
664,BLAKE,664,A hundred and seventy eight.
665,SAUL,665,"Alright. You gimme all your money, you
can each take two handfuls of weed. That
treat ya right?"
666,DESMOND,666,That's fucking awesome!
667,SAUL,667,I know. Keep it on the down low.
668,ACK,668,"Jason'll never believe this...until I
show him all this weed!"
669,SAUL,669,"And we, my good man, are officially scott
fuckin' free."
670,DALE,670,There are still people trying to kill us.
671,SAUL,671,"But at least now we can afford to run.
I'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks.
Let's have us a little mardi-gras
fiesta."
672,POLICE LIAISON,672,Don't move!
673,POLICE LIAISON (CONT'D),673,"Don't move! This stuff hurts. What's in
your hand?"
674,DALE.,674,"I'm sorry, Ma'am. It's weed. I'll get rid
of it right away, I was just smoking
this. I...I thought it was
decriminalized. Or something. For medical
purposes. I have epilepsy."
675,POLICE LIAISON,675,"Selling pot to my students isn't
""decriminalized."" I'm the liaison officer
for this school and I just caught four
students showing off handfuls of
marijuana to their friends. They told me
they got it back here. Put your hands up."
676,DALE,676,"Wait! I wasn't selling anything! All I
have is this little joint."
677,POLICE LIAISON,677,You call this little?
678,DALE,678,"I don't even have any money! How did I
sell weed if I don't have any money?!? I
was just smoking it. I swear. Please."
679,POLICE LIAISON,679,"It's possible you're telling the truth.
I'm going to run a check and if it turns
out you don't have any priors and all
you've got is this small amount of
marijuana, I'll let you go with a fine.
Take a seat."
680,SAUL,680,"They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh
fuck..."
681,CAROL,681,Denton.
682,DALE,682,"What is this for? What did that thing
tell you? What did I do?"
683,POLICE LIAISON,683,"Hit and run, Mr. Denton. A double,
actually. You hit two parked cars two
nights ago."
684,SAUL,684,The lady cop. She's gonna kill him.
685,DALE,685,"You don't understand! You have to let me
go! Dirty cops are gonna kill me! Please!"
686,DALE (CONT'D),686,"This...this lady cop, and these guys
Budlofsky and Matheson, they all work for
Ted Jones, and-"
687,POLICE LIAISON,687,Ted Jones?
688,DALE,688,"Yeah. With grey-hair. Tell me you know
what I'm talking about. He lives near
Evergreen Heights. He-"
689,POLICE LIAISON,689,"Are you telling me you saw Ted Jones and
a police office shoot someone?"
690,DALE,690,Yeah. An Asian someone.
691,POLICE LIAISON,691,"Stay calm, do as your told, I'll get you
down to the station."
692,DALE,692,Yes ma'am.
693,POLICE LIAISON,693,Oh my god! Is that blood? Oh my god!
694,DALE,694,NO! What are you doing!?!
695,SAUL,695,"Saving you. Hold on, amigo. Tango and
Cash!"
696,POLICE LIAISON,696,Freeze mister! Don't even...
697,DALE,697,No! She was going to help us!
698,SAUL,698,"Oh...my balls...I seriously think I
popped one..."
699,DALE,699,IT'S HER! The lady cop!
700,SAUL,700,Then who's that?
701,SAUL,701,The slurpee! I can't see!
702,DALE,702,Turn on the wipers!
703,SAUL,703,"Dude, I seriously can't see!"
704,DALE,704,"Kick out the window! Isn't that what they
do?"
705,SAUL,705,I don't know. Okay.
706,SAUL (CONT'D),706,Oh fuck! Shit!
707,DALE,707,Get it out of there!
708,SAUL,708,Ah! Ah! My leg!
709,DALE,709,She's following us! She's gaining on us!
710,SAUL,710,Her car's better!
711,SAUL (CONT'D),711,Ha! I can see! Through my leg hole!
712,DALE,712,Do something!
713,SAUL,713,Hold on. I've got an idea.
714,DALE,714,WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!?!?
715,SAUL,715,"Oh shit, man! I'm sorry! I thought she'd
keep going."
716,DALE,716,Turn on the sirens!
717,SAUL,717,Run!
718,DALE,718,Saul! Saul! I'm locked in!
719,DALE (CONT'D),719,You dumb fucking fuck!!! HELP ME!!!
720,SAUL,720,"So... huff ... huff ...fuckin'
sorry... huff ...forgot..."
721,DALE,721,"Don't touch me, you asshole!"
722,SAUL,722,"Okay, only one way to do this, hard and
fast. Bend over."
723,DALE,723,Ow! Ow! Hurry!
724,SAUL,724,I am!
725,DALE,725,Which saw do you like most?
726,SAUL,726,"The brown ones nice, but the metallic
ones seems more..."
727,DALE,727,"Okay, I'm going to go call Angie. Be
right back."
728,SAUL,728,A thank you would be nice!
729,DALE,729,"Could I have the, uh, Carlyle room,
please?"
730,ANGIE,730,Dale?
731,DALE,731,Angie! Thank god you're okay!
732,ANGIE,732,I'm fine. How are you? Are you okay?
733,DALE,733,"I'm great. I'm fine. I miss you. So,
here's the plan, babe. I'm going to leave
town and contact a government official or
something. From somewhere safe. I know
this shit is all fucked up and I just
can't apologize enough."
734,ANGIE,734,Dale. I've realized some problems and-
735,DALE,735,"I know there's a problem! That's the
thing, that's why I-"
736,ANGIE,736,"Dale, shut up and listen. People are
trying to kill you, and me! Dale, drug
dealers are trying to kill me, because of
you! It's fucking over, man. Are you
kidding me? For gods sake..."
737,DALE,737,"Angie, no! No! Don't you get it? I was
thrown into this situation, I had no
control, but I am dealing with it. This
kind of thing happens, you know-"
738,ANGIE,738,"NO! IT DOESN""T!"
739,ANGIE,739,"You're immature, Dale! I'm six years
younger and I'm saying this! And the fact
that you think you're some kind of
fucking genius just makes it a hundred
times more infuriating!"
740,DALE,740,"What? You're telling me you think I'm a
dumb guy?"
741,ANGIE,741,"You're not how you think you are Dale,
and it's pathetic. Call me when I can go
home."
742,SAUL,742,"Alrghit, I'll see you soon. And I'm sorry
again about the clocks."
743,SAUL,743,Ha! What a douche bag.
744,SAUL,744,"Yeah, love you too."
745,SAUL (CONT'D),745,"Yo, so before we go on the lamb I gotta
go see my grandma, okay? She was worried
`cause I didn't show up to help with the
locks. But before that I've got to smoke
another bowl."
746,DALE,746,"Are you joking? You're actually gonna
smoke marijuana?"
747,SAUL,747,Why not?
748,DALE,748,"How can you smoke marijuana after what we
just went through? That clearly happened
because we were smoking marijuana."
749,SAUL,749,"No. It happened because those fucking
kids didn't keep that shit on the down
low. Which is weird, `cause they really
seemed like cool kids."
750,DALE,750,"If you haven't noticed, we're not very
functional when we're stoned, Saul."
751,SAUL,751,"When I saved you with those Slurpees I
was stoned. What do you gotta say to
that? Maybe the pot is what gave me the
creative capacity to come up with such a
great plan! The Beatles were high!"
752,DALE,752,"You didn't save me! She was going to
protect us, and now we're wanted for all
sorts of crazy shit!"
753,DALE (CONT'D),753,"Fine. Smoke marijuana. But you know how
""Scarface"" ends. Face down, dead, in your
own fuckin' water fountain."
754,SAUL,754,"For one thing, I'm done dealing pot.
Mostly, because I don't know where I
would get it now, but still. And ""b"",
fuck you, man. You can't judge me. We're
exactly the same, and this whole thing's
your fucking fault. You're the one who
dropped the roach!"
755,DALE,755,It's not my fault!
756,DALE (CONT'D),756,It's marijuana's fault!
757,SAUL,757,Stop calling it marijuana!
758,DALE,758,"Grow up, you fucking two year old."
759,SAUL,759,"See! This is why you're a douche bag,
Denton. Because you think you're better
than others, but you're just a dumb
pothead burnout, same as me."
760,DALE,760,"Maybe I am a pothead burnout, but at
least I'm not the dumbest most annoying
guy in the world. The only reason I ever
bought weed from you was because you're
shit is so good, not because you're cool."
761,SAUL,761,"But you said you bought when you already
had a few times, just to hang out?"
762,DALE,762,"Bullshit! I just like...liked having lots
of different kinds of weed at once."
763,SAUL,763,Here. Buy yourself a good last meal.
764,SAUL (CONT'D),764,"Super size it, bitch."
765,DALE,765,"Saul! I'm sorry, man! I didn't mean all
that! Saul!"
766,CAROL,766,"Guy drove like a mother-fucker. It was
amazing."
767,TED,767,"This is not good. We should have this
under control. We haven't heard shit from
the Asians. Got these lunatics after us.
Shit."
768,CAROL,768,We should probably get to the farm.
769,ELDERLY WOMAN(O.S.),769,Solly?
770,SAUL,770,Hey! Mrs. Mendelson!
771,SAUL (CONT'D),771,HOLY SHIT!!!
772,MATHESON,772,Eat it!
773,INJURED PERSON,773,"OW! Shit...ow, ow, ow!"
774,MRS. CORBER,774,Solly Silver?!?
775,SAUL,775,Mrs. Corber! You gotta hide me!
776,MATHESON,776,AHH!!! FUCK!!!
777,SAUL,777,NOOO!!!
778,BUDLOFSKY,778,Yeah!
779,OLD WOMAN,779,"Oh, god this is terrible. Poor Faye.
Poor, poor Faye."
780,DALE,780,"Hey, uh, what's going on here?"
781,OLD MAN,781,It just happened.
782,DALE,782,What did?
783,OLD WOMAN,783,"Faye Belogus' grandson was kidnapped from
right inside the building. We all saw it.
They fought in the majong room and hurt
the new nurse, Stefan."
784,DALE,784,Uh...thanks.
785,OLD MAN,785,"If I was there, I would've kicked an ass."
786,DALE,786,"Mrs. Belogus. I wouldn't worry, Saul's
going to be fine."
787,SAUL,787,ARRGGGHHH!!!
788,SAUL (CONT'D),788,Fuck. I regret everything.
789,BUDLOFSKY,789,Get up.
790,SAUL,790,Oh fuck. That looks painful.
791,SAUL (CONT'D),791,EEEHH!!!
792,BUDLOFSKY,792,Don't. Ted wants him.
793,MATHESON,793,Fine.
794,SAUL,794,El Dorado.
795,SAUL (CONT'D),795,"Dude, look at all this weed."
796,MATHESON,796,Shut the fuck up and keep moving.
797,SAUL,797,What the hell is that?
798,SAUL (CONT'D),798,Ow.
799,DALE,799,Hello? Anyone here? Red?
800,DALE (CONT'D),800,Oh my god.
801,RED,801,What? Who the fuck!
802,RED (CONT'D),802,"Stay the fuck back, Denton! I didn't do
shit! I'll gut ya if I have to, tooled ya
once, tool ya again!"
803,DALE,803,"I...what? I'm not here to fight, man, I-"
804,RED,804,"Good, man. I'm fuckin' tired."
805,RED (CONT'D),805,"I'm dyin', Denton. Fuckin' shot. Right
here-"
806,RED (CONT'D),806,"I'm having a little going away party and
I don't remember inviting you,
cocksucker. So I'm gonna ask you to
leave. In my dying moments, I don't want
some asshole I barely know around."
807,DALE,807,"Go to the hospital, man! Are you crazy.
You don't have to die."
808,RED,808,"Yes I do! What? I go to the hospital, I'm
gonna end up in But that doesn't matter
`cause once Ted finds out, which he will,
I'm dead wherever I am. I'm fucked
through and through. Now if you'd be
willing to give a dying man his wish,
could ya run on into the other room and
pop in disc two of Tu Pacs ""All Eyez On
Me"". I want to listen to it while I die."
809,DALE,809,You don't have to die.
810,RED,810,"Will you stop saying that, I've excepted
it, man. I'm at peace.  cough"
811,DALE,811,"Red, I need you to tell me where Ted's
base is. He took Saul, and I can't bail
on him. I'm going to get him back."
812,RED,812,"Fuckin eh, amigo."
813,RED (CONT'D),813,"Blaze of glory, motherfucker."
814,RED,814,"This is awesome! We're so gonna show
those motherfuckers. Think they can kill
me? Fuck no, you can't! Not how I roll."
815,DALE,815,What are you doing?
816,RED,816,"So, this is the backside of the farm. If
you stay low in the grass you should be
fine. If someone is shooting at you with
an automatic weapon, zig zag. It makes
you harder to hit."
817,DALE,817,You're not coming to help?
818,RED,818,"Fuck no! I've been shot. By these guys. I
was in shock before, but the air on the
drive cleared my mind, I should get to
the hospital. You saw Reservoir Dogs,
right? I got shot in the best spot
possible. I could have a long and
fruitful life ahead of me. Full of
possibilities. Go get `em, slugger."
819,DALE,819,"But how do I get out of here if I rescue
Saul?"
820,RED,820,"I've no idea. I'm sure it won't be that
hard. Kill some dude and take his car, or
just take it or whatever. Good luck,
amigo!"
821,DALE,821,"I'll blow his fuckin' brains out if you
don't-"
822,DALE (CONT'D),822,Oh my god.
823,THUG 2,823,"What the fuck was that, Budlofsky?"
824,BUDLOFSKY,824,"Haven't you seen ""Speed""? ""Shoot the
hostage""."
825,THUG 2,825,"In the leg, you fucking moron!"
826,BUDLOFSKY,826,Still worked.
827,BUDLOFSKY (CONT'D),827,"Throw him in with the other guy, and
everyone stay alert. Jared, go watch
outside. This is fucked up. Somethings
going down."
828,THUG 3,828,I think he's got a gun.
829,BUDLOFSKY,829,What?
830,BUDLOFSKY (CONT'D),830,"You're kidding me, right? Die Hard?"
831,DALE,831,I had to try.
832,THUG 3 (O.S.),832,"Hey! He's got another one taped to his
stomach!"
833,THUG 4 (O.S.),833,And his leg!
834,SAUL,834,"Dale!?! What the fuck? Did you rat me
out, you shitty bastard? That what
happened?"
835,DALE,835,No! I came here to save you!
836,SAUL,836,"To save me? Ha! That's rich! You're
caught, too. And now I have to die with
some asshole."
837,DALE,837,"Saul, I deserved that, because I fucked
you. You're right, this whole things my
fault, and they only way I can make it up
to you is by rescuing you, and that's why
I'm here. To save my friend."
838,SAUL,838,"Tell ya what, Dale. You actually save me
and I'll consider forgiving you for this
mad shit."
839,DALE,839,Good. `Cause I will.
840,SAUL,840,"Oh really? What, you forget to tell me
you shoot lasers out of your eyes, or you
got some kind of secret blowtorch
strapped to your dick? We're not gonna
escape, Dale, we're losers, and sinners,
and after we die, we're gonna go to hell!"
841,DALE,841,"We're not losers! We did that car chase.
That was all you, man! You got away from
the cops. I've watched, like, nine
billion hours of worlds wildest police
chases and I've never seen a guy get
away. Not once! But you did it. You did
the impossible."
842,MATHESON,842,"We can hear you out there, and it's
annoying. Shut the fuck up."
843,DALE,843,"Perfect! Now rub your wrists against my
belt! My belt buckle'll cut the tape. Do
it! This is it!"
844,DALE (CONT'D),844,Hurry!
845,DALE (CONT'D),845,"Yes! Yes! You know what this is called,
Saul? This is called saving you."
846,TED,846,You have them?
847,BUDLOFSKY,847,Got them downstairs.
848,CAROL,848,Where did you find them?
849,BUDLOFSKY,849,"We found Saul at his grandmother's and
Dale Denton busted in here like a madman,
armed to the teeth, and-"
850,BUDLOFSKY (CONT'D),850,"Yeah, he just plugged Frank and then I
disarmed him. We got `em both holed up
downstairs."
851,TED,851,He shot Frank? Jesus. Fuckin' Frank.
852,CAROL,852,Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?
853,TED,853,"Well, we'll torture these two bastards
and find out everything they know. What
about the shipment? Ready to move out?"
854,BUDLOFSKY,854,We'll be good to in 10 minutes or so.
855,DALE,855,"This isn't working. Turn around. I'm
using my mouth."
856,SAUL,856,Someone's coming!
857,DALE,857,"Yo - if I cough, I'm going to make a
move, if I cough twice, you take the
lead. Got it?"
858,SAUL,858,What? No! What if you actually cough?
859,MATHESON,859,"Hey man, whatever you're doing, I get it,
okay? So just stop it, alright? Just cut
it-"
860,MATHESON (CONT'D),860,AAAHHHHH!!!
861,SAUL,861,"Holy shit, man! I'm sorry!"
862,MATHESON,862,"AAAHHHHH!!! ARGH!!! YOU SHOT ME! I'VE
NEVER BEEN SHOT! HELP! HELP!
AAAAAHHHHH!!!"
863,TED,863,Has anyone seen my bigger knife?
864,TED,864,Do you guys hear that?
865,BUDLOFSKY,865,Arg...
866,TED,866,BUDLOFSKY!!!
867,ASIAN ASSASSIN 1,867,WAR IS UPON YOU!!!
868,SAUL,868,Dale? You're alive!
869,DALE,869,What happened?
870,SAUL,870,They got your ear.
871,DALE,871,My what?
872,SAUL,872,Here. Get up.
873,DALE,873,AAHHHH!!! MY EAR!!!
874,DALE (CONT'D),874,YOU KILLED MY EAR!!!
875,MATHESON,875,You shot me..
876,SAUL,876,"Well, you kneed my balls!"
877,DALE,877,You shot him?
878,DALE (CONT'D),878,Whoa.
879,SAUL (CONT'D),879,What's that noise?
880,DALE,880,"I don't know! That guy just blew half my
fucking ear off!"
881,SAUL,881,"There's some dudes in here. I saw them
when I got dragged down. And there's some
kind of super-suit or something."
882,DALE,882,Were they armed?
883,SAUL,883,I don't think so.
884,DALE,884,I can't hear them.
885,SAUL,885,You could boost me up! We'll sneak out.
886,DALE,886,Shoot back!
887,SAUL,887,Really?
888,DALE,888,YES!
889,DALE (CONT'D),889,Now run!
890,DALE (CONT'D),890,SAUL                             DALE
891,DALE (CONT'D),891,Nice. You got him.
892,THUG 7,892,Lance? Holy fuck! You sons-of-
893,DALE,893,Holy shit. I killed him.
894,SAUL,894,"About time you killed somebody. You're
the one whose supposed to be saving me,
and I`ve killed two bad guys already."
895,DALE,895,"You'll never be able to pull me up, but
I'll boost you up there and you just
fucking run for it, man."
896,SAUL,896,"What? No fucking way, Dale. What about
you?"
897,DALE,897,Don't worry about me.
898,SAUL,898,Whoa. That was awesome.
899,SAUL (CONT'D),899,"You're a good man, Dale Denton."
900,DALE,900,Hold on!
901,SAUL,901,Wha-
902,TED,902,Denton!!!

904,SAUL (CONT'D),904,"Ew. Gross, man. A fuckin' dead guy."
905,SAUL,905,Fuck...
906,DALE,906,Oh god.
907,TED,907,"Where are you, you son-of-a-bitch?"
908,DALE,908,Ha!
909,SAUL,909,Fuck tha po-lice.
910,CAROL,910,"I'm a fucking cop, you moron."
911,SAUL,911,AAAAAAARRRRGGGGGHHH!!!
912,DALE,912,"You can't fucking take me. I'm young.
Virile. Prime of my life. You're old. Old
and dying."
913,TED,913,"I don't know who you are, Denton, or why
you're trying to ruin my life, but you're
fuckin' dead!"
914,SAUL,914,"Crazy  huff   huff , psycho bitch..."
915,MATHESON (O.S.),915,Hey Saul!
916,MATHESON (CONT'D),916,"I owe you one. In the gut. Then the
balls, and then the-"
917,RED,917,"You just got killed by a Ford Fiesta
motherfucker!!! How you like me now!?!"
918,SAUL,918,R...Red?
919,RED,919,"Saul! `sup! Dude, me and that Dale guy
are rescuing you. And getting revenge on
those whose shot us in the gut."
920,SAUL,920,RED!!!
921,SAUL (CONT'D),921,Oh no...
922,CAROL,922,Oh yeah!
923,CAROL,923,Now prepare to eat shit and die-
924,DALE,924,"Sorry, Ted..."

931,DALE,931,"We... Cough ...we did it. We beat them.
We won."
932,SAUL,932,No fucking way. Seriously?
933,SAUL,933,How did that happen?
934,DALE,934,I have absolutely no idea.
935,SAUL,935,"They were fighting Asian dudes, man."
936,DALE,936,"Asian dudes? So, okay...maybe this is
revenge for that Asian dude I saw Ted
kill."
937,SAUL,937,"So we're, like, in a drug war. That's
cool."
938,DALE,938,"What's cool is that you came back for me
man. You did, right? You weren't just
captured again, were you?"
939,SAUL,939,"Hell no! I was scott-free. But how the
hell was I going to leave you there after
you came to save me? Fuck that."
940,RED,940,"Motherfuckers. Motherfuckers. Light me on
fire? Kill my Fiesta? Fuckers."
941,DALE,941,Red? You okay?
942,RED,942,"Fuck yeah, I'm fine. I'm Red. You're
makin' me feel like a broken record. Now
can we get the fuck out of this shit
hole."
943,DALE,943,What? Why?
944,RED,944,"You're that dude whose always calling
KSTAR about havin' two garbage days. I
totally agree with you, man. I work out
of my house, and it's, like, one of my
main concerns, garbage pile up."
945,DALE,945,"Saul, what're you going to do?"
946,SAUL,946,Work at a bong shop.
947,RED,947,I'm still selling weed. Fuck you guys.
948,SAUL,948,Do you hear something?
949,DALE,949,All I hear is ringing.
950,SAUL,950,"Dude, I'm kind of freakin' out. Like...I
don't know...like, there might be someone
out there. I mean...how do we know we got
them all?"
951,RED,951,"What the fuck are you guys talkin' about?
I don't hear shit."
952,DALE,952,"Well...the barn did collapse in a ball of
fire, and we probably each inhaled about
ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just,
you know-"
953,DALE (CONT'D),953,...a little paranoia.
954,SAUL,954,Stop!
955,RED,955,Are you guys fuckin' with me?
956,DALE,956,What-
957,DALE (CONT'D),957,What is-
958,SAUL,958,Sshh! Can you hear that?
959,DALE,959,What?
960,RED,960,Oh fuck. I'm freakin' out.
961,SAUL,961,Just listen.
962,DALE,962,I literally only hear ringing.
963,RED,963,Fuck this noise!
964,DALE,964,I'm following him.
965,SAUL,965,Wait! Me too!
