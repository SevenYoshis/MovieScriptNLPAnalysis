0,GENERAL PUTKIN,0,Boone?
1,LIEUTENANT BOONE,1,Yes General?
2,GENERAL PUTKIN,2,I'm going into the next office.
3,LIEUTENANT BOONE,3,Yes sir.
4,GENERAL PUTKIN,4,Damn it!
5,GENERAL PUTKIN (O.S.),5,"I have been having ideas,
gentlemen. Challenging ideas. And
when I thought about these ideas I
thought about who in the U.S Army
would be most receptive to my
challenging ideas."
6,"GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D) (O.S.)
(CONT'D)",6,"Which section of the military is
always straining to reach the peak
of their physical and mental
capabilities?"
7,GENERAL PUTKIN,7,"You are, gentlemen. Special
Forces."
8,GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D),8,"I want to talk to you about Mind
Wars, gentlemen. War...With...
MINDS..."
9,GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D),9,"How'd you like to be able to do
this? What if you could teach
soldiers to do this? Would you be
interested?"
10,GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D),10,"Or, or let's say you have a unit
operating outside the protection
of mainline units. What happens if
someone gets hurt? How do you deal
with that?"
11,GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D),11,"Psychic healing! Protect the unit
with hands-off healing. Using the
mind to heal."
12,GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D),12,"Let's talk about time! What if
time is not a point but a space
and at any one instant we can be
anywhere in that space! (Laughing)
Physicists go nuts when I say
that!"
13,GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D),13,"Animals! Stopping the hearts of
animals! This is the idea I'm
coming to you with. You have
access to animals right?"
14,MAJOR HOLTZ,14,"No sir. We don't have access to
animals."
15,BOB (V.O.),15,"In 1983, when Special Forces told
General Putkin that they weren't
interested in his ideas...that was
a lie."
16,BOB (V.O.),16,"And when they told him they didn't
have access to animals...that was
also a lie."
17,BOB (V.O.),17,"The hundred goats in the disused
hospital building had been
secretly flown in from Central
America so as to avoid customs.
Special Forces weren't worried
about the General hearing the
goats because they'd been de-
bleated."
18,BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D),18,This is the story of those goats.
19,BOB (V.O.),19,"My name is Bob Wilton. Imagine me
back in Michigan, where I was born
and raised. I studied journalism
at Western in Kalamazoo and then I
got a job at the Ann Arbor Daily
Telegram. I wrote a lot of stories
about competitive food eating
contests."
20,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),20,"Look at me. So young. ""The past is
a different country. They...do
things there."""
21,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),21,This is Ron.
22,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),22,He's the man who died.
23,BOB (V.O.),23,"My wife, Debora, told me later
that Ron's death had been like a
wake-up call for her - what people
used to call a memento mori."
24,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),24,"That massive coronary had reminded
her that life was too short to
waste any chance of true
happiness."
25,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),25,"A week after the funeral she left
me for my editor."
26,BOB (V.O.),26,"It seemed like such a tragedy at
the time. We couldn't see beyond
our little lives to the great
events of history unfolding out
there in the world."
27,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),27,"I was like a child. Or a Hobbit,
safe in the Shire."
28,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),28,"Or a blonde farm boy on a distant,
desert planet, unaware that he was
already taking the first steps on
the path that will lead him
inexorably towards the heart of a
conflict between the forces of
Good and Evil."
29,PRESIDENT BUSH,29,"Americans are a resolute people,
who have risen to every test of
our time. Adversity has revealed
the character of our country, to
the world, and to ourselves..."
30,BOB (V.O.),30,"Had I known where that path would
lead, had a soft wind from my
future brought me the name of Bill
Django, I might never have gone.
But as it was, I did what so many
men have done throughout history
when a woman has broken their
heart... I went to war."
31,BOB,31,"Yeah, no it's been...well, I won't
lie to you Debora - it's been
pretty damn hairy."
32,DEBORA (O.S.),32,"Yeah. We've been watching it on
Fox."
33,BOB,33,"Yeah, it's not, uh... I've seen
things that you shouldn't, you
know..."
34,BOB (CONT'D),34,Pretty damn hairy.
35,DEBORA (O.S.),35,"Well I don't even know why you're
there. You're not exactly war
correspondent material are you?"
36,BOB,36,"Well, I think it's important
people get an accurate picture of
what's..."
37,DEBORA (O.S.),37,What? Yeah.
38,BOB,38,"...what's, uh, happening, so...is
that Dave?"
39,DEBORA (O.S.),39,Yeah. He says Hi.
40,BOB,40,"Oh, that's, that's..."
41,BOB (CONT'D),41,"Okay. Gotta go. We're moving out -
heading up north to cover the
fighting there..."
42,JOURNALIST (O.S.),42,You missed the war?
43,BOB,43,Yeah.
44,SECOND JOURNALIST,44,How?
45,BOB,45,"I've been stuck here. They've only
just given me the green-light. So
I'll probably head over there
soon. I'm just working on this
story about American contractors
coming over for the re-build."
46,BOB (CONT'D),46,"Yeah, I think they didn't want me
going over because I'm not
embedded."
47,SECOND JOURNALIST,47,"Yeah, they don't like the unilats.
The troops think the unilats'll
stab `em in the back. When you're
EMBEDDED
you form a bond with the soldiers.
You're like one of them."
48,FIRST JOURNALIST,48,You see action?
49,SECOND JOURNALIST,49,"Went into Baghdad with Charlie
Company, Second Brigade, Third
Infantry Division..."
50,FIRST JOURNALIST,50,"The thunder run? Heard you had it
pretty bad."
51,SECOND JOURNALIST,51,"Could say that. Technicals all the
way, RPG's, fuckers were firing
anti-aircraft guns at us..."
52,FIRST JOURNALIST,52,"You know a Private First Class
Zuchero?"
53,SECOND MAN,53,"Zook? I was standing next to him
when he took a hit..."
54,BOB,54,So what's a useful phrase?
55,KUWAIT WAITER,55,"La termi, ana sahafi."
56,BOB,56,What's that mean?
57,KUWAIT WAITER,57,"Don't shoot, I'm a reporter."
58,BOB,58,Hey.
59,MAN,59,Hey.
60,BOB,60,DeWitt Resources. Arkansas.
61,MAN,61,Right. We make trash cans.
62,BOB,62,"You over here for the conference?
Looking for a contract right?"
63,MAN,63,I guess.
64,BOB,64,What's your pitch?
65,MAN,65,Well...we're real cheap.
66,BOB,66,Bob Wilton.
67,LYN CASSADY,67,Skip.
68,BOB,68,"Could I bum a smoke, Skip?"
69,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),69,"I sat there watching those
reporters and realized I didn't
want to be me anymore. I wanted to
be them. I wanted to face peril
and stand witness to the fall and
rise of nations."
70,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),70,"Everyone gets everything he wants.
Like the man said. I wanted a
mission."
71,BOB (CONT'D),71,"Oh crap, can't find my..."
72,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),72,"And for my sins, Fate brought me
one."
73,BOB (CONT'D),73,Lyn Cassady...?
74,GUS LACEY (O.S.),74,"This is the home learning course
we're putting out, which is very
popular."
75,GUS LACEY,75,"Then there's the seminars. When
I'm not teaching I spend a lotta
time, right here, remote viewing."
76,BOB,76,Right here?
77,GUS LACEY,77,"The kitchen table. That is
correct. That's where my body is.
But my mind...that's, you know..."
78,BOB,78,Wandering?
79,GUS LACEY,79,Wandering. Roaming. Yeah.
80,BOB,80,So what have you seen lately?
81,GUS LACEY,81,"Lately I've been watching the Loch
Ness Monster in Scotland, England -
which it turns out is the ghost of
a dinosaur. That's an exclusive
for you."
82,BOB,82,Okay. Wow.
83,BOB (CONT'D),83,"So...when did this all start for
you Gus?"
84,GUS LACEY,84,"It started when I was a kid. I
used to lie on my bed and RV my
cousin, Irene, undressing at
night. Then, when I was in the
army I joined Bill Django's unit.
He trained me and the rest, as
they say..."
85,BOB,85,Right. I don't know who that is.
86,GUS LACEY,86,I can't really talk about Bill.
87,BOB,87,So what did you do in the army?
88,GUS LACEY,88,"We were Psychic Spies mainly. That
was our initial tasking but...once
they realized what they were
sitting on, the forces at work..."
89,GUS LACEY (CONT'D),89,We were trained to kill animals.
90,BOB,90,"You mean, what...with your...?"
91,GUS LACEY,91,"With our minds. That is correct.
Just by staring at them."
92,BOB,92,Huh. What kind of animals?
93,GUS LACEY,93,"One of our unit stopped the heart
of a goat."
94,BOB,94,"Wow.(Beat) I don't know what to
say."
95,GUS LACEY,95,"The power they unlocked in us...
(Beat, sorrowfully) Last week I
killed my hamster. (Beat) You
wanna see?"
96,GUS LACEY,96,"You ever seen a hamster do that
before?"
97,BOB,97,"Well, I've never owned a hamster
Gus, so I don't know what..."
98,GUS LACEY,98,"Look at the way it's glaring at
its wheel. Usually that hamster
loves its wheel."
99,BOB,99,"Maybe some of the readers have
hamsters so..."
100,GUS LACEY,100,"Good. Then they'll know how rare
that is."
101,BOB,101,"Yeah, I guess any hamster-owning
readers will know what's
aberrant behavior and, uh,
what's...Oh, shit, he's down!"
102,GUS LACEY,102,"Yeah, he's down. At this point I'd
been staring at him for about
three hours."
103,BOB,103,"Oh my God! You've dropped both
hamsters!"
104,GUS LACEY,104,"No, the other one's just fallen
over."
105,GUS LACEY (CONT'D),105,Bizarre. Right?
106,BOB,106,"Well...it didn't die. I thought
you said you killed it?"
107,GUS LACEY,107,"Yeah well...(He gestures to his
Mother) Mother said no. She said
you might be a bleeding-heart
liberal. She said ""Don't show him
the hamster dying. Show him the
tape where the hamster acts
bizarre instead."""
108,GUS LACEY (CONT'D),108,"This was nothing. You should have
seen the Skipper at work."
109,BOB,109,Who's the Skipper?
110,GUS LACEY,110,"Lyn Cassady. After Bill he was the
most psi-gifted guy I ever met. He
was like an Occultic force. (Beat)
I think he runs a dance studio
now."
111,BOB,111,Do you...do you know a Gus Lacey?
112,BOB (CONT'D),112,Lyn? (Beat) Skip? (Beat) Lyn?
113,BOB,113,Whoa!
114,LYN CASSADY,114,You working for Hooper?
115,BOB,115,"Hooper? No. I work for the Ann
Arbor Daily Telegram."
116,LYN CASSADY,116,How do you know about Lacey?
117,BOB,117,"I interviewed him a few years ago.
He'd been appearing on this radio
talk show."
118,LYN CASSADY,118,Little prick...what'd he tell you?
119,BOB,119,"He said he joined Bill Django's
unit in the army and was trained
to, to, uh remote view?"
120,BOB (CONT'D),120,"And he said the Loch Ness Monster
was the ghost of a dinosaur. Who's
Bill Django?"
121,LYN CASSADY,121,"Did he show you his ""Home Study
Course""?"
122,BOB,122,Yes.
123,LYN CASSADY,123,Yeah I bet he did.
124,BOB,124,"Are you...? Do you mean you
corroborate his, uh...? Because,
see, I thought he was just an
idiot?"
125,LYN CASSADY,125,"He is an idiot...or he was...he's
dead now. He was a paranormal
whore. Always trying to get into
the spotlight, yak, yak yaking. We
took an oath. We don't divulge..."
126,BOB,126,"But you're saying there was a
secret unit?"
127,LYN CASSADY,127,We...don't...divulge.
128,LYN CASSADY,128,"Okay. Let me ask you something.
What color were the chairs in the
hotel bar?"
129,BOB,129,Uh...?
130,LYN CASSADY,130,"You were in there for hours. What
color were the chairs?"
131,BOB,131,Um...brown?
132,LYN CASSADY,132,"They were green. How many lights
are there in this room?"
133,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),133,"A Super Soldier wouldn't need to
look. He would just know."
134,BOB,134,A Super Soldier?
135,LYN CASSADY,135,"A Jedi Warrior. He would know
where all the lights were. He
could walk through a room and tell
you how many power outlets there
were. People are walking around
with their eyes closed. At Level
One we were trained to instantly
absorb all details."
136,BOB,136,What's a Jedi Warrior?
137,LYN CASSADY,137,You're looking at one.
138,BOB,138,You're a Jedi Warrior?
139,LYN CASSADY,139,That's correct.
140,BOB,140,"What does that...? I don't think
I..."
141,LYN CASSADY,141,"I'm Sergeant First Class Lyn
Cassady, Special Forces, retired.
In the eighties I
was trained at Fort Bragg in a
secret initiative code-named
Project Jedi. The objective of the
project was to create Super
Soldiers."
142,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),142,"Soldiers with Super Powers. We
were the first
generation of the New Earth Army."
143,BOB,143,You've got super powers?
144,LYN CASSADY,144,That's correct.
145,BOB,145,"Hold on, let me...let me just..."
146,BOB (CONT'D),146,"Okay, so, so you're saying you
were a Psychic Spy, like Lacey?"
147,LYN CASSADY,147,We prefer the term Remote Viewer.
148,BOB,148,How does that work?
149,LYN CASSADY,149,"Different Jedi had different
techniques. Mel Landau used to
visualize packing all his cares
and worries in a little suitcase,
to clear his mind. Steve Cuttle
used to read Bible verse..."
150,BOB,150,What about you?
151,LYN CASSADY,151,"Well, I find drinking helps. Also
if I'm listening to classic rock
music."
152,BOB,152,Yeah? (Beat) Like who?
153,LYN CASSADY,153,"I like Boston. Boston usually
works."
154,BOB,154,"What other powers did you
practise?"
155,LYN CASSADY,155,Invisibility.
156,BOB,156,Invisibility?
157,LYN CASSADY,157,Yup. That was Level Three.
158,BOB,158,Actual invisibility?
159,LYN CASSADY,159,"Well...yeah, that was the goal.
But after a while we adapted it to
just finding a way of not being
seen. When you understand the, the
linkage between observation and
reality, you learn to dance with
invisibility."
160,BOB,160,Like camouflage?
161,LYN CASSADY,161,"It's not like camouflage. We also
practised Phasing. Crossing from
particle to wave, from the
physical realm to the plane of
energy. Solid objects seem to pass
right through you. It's starts
with a breathing exercise..."
162,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),162,"Then you think black. That's the
nothingness."
163,BOB,163,"I don't...can I be honest, Lyn? I
don't know what to make of this. I
don't know what to say. This is
amazing stuff. (Beat) How would
you...I wanna...could I write a
story about this?"
164,LYN CASSADY,164,Not going to happen.
165,BOB,165,"No, but see, I've been looking for
a story Lyn. I was going to
write about the re-build contracts
but this...this is even better and
I..."
166,LYN CASSADY,166,Not going to happen.
167,BOB,167,"All I'm saying is we could talk
some more tomorrow and..."
168,LYN CASSADY,168,I'm shipping out tomorrow.
169,BOB,169,You're going home?
170,LYN CASSADY,170,"Going to Iraq. There's this
factory we might be partnering
with in Al Qaim."
171,BOB,171,Oh.
172,BOB (CONT'D),172,I could come.
173,LYN CASSADY,173,What?
174,BOB,174,"I could come with you, maybe,
and..."
175,LYN CASSADY,175,"Bob, I don't want to be a story,
okay? I don't need the attention
and..."
176,BOB,176,"No, listen, we could change names,
stuff could stay off record and..."
177,LYN CASSADY,177,"It's a war over there Bob. Okay? A
war. I can't be looking out for
you."
178,BOB,178,"Well you know, you don't...
I look after myself. Okay? I look
after...And I've been
in some pretty hairy situations
before. I'm not, you know...I'm a
journalist, Lyn. You understand?"
179,BOB (CONT'D),179,"A journalist. I go where the story
is."
180,BOB (V.O.)(CONT'D),180,"I was an American. I was Resolute.
I wanted adversity to reveal my
character to the world. And to my
wife. And to that one-armed cunt
Dave."
181,LYN CASSADY,181,What's this?
182,BOB,182,"What? Nothing. I was just
doodling."
183,BOB (CONT'D),183,What's the matter?
184,LYN CASSADY,184,Nothing.
185,BOB (V.O.),185,"The U.S Army doesn't really have
any serious alternative than to be
Wonderful!"
186,BOB(V.O.) (CONT'D),186,"This does not represent the
official position of the United
States Army at this time."
187,LYN CASSADY,187,"You wanted to know who Bill Django
was? (Beat) He's the man who wrote
that book."
188,BOB,188,"The New Earth Army is a banner
under which the forces of good can
gather. The courage and nobility
of the Warrior, blended with the
spirituality of the Monk."
189,BOB,189,"The Jedi Warrior will follow in
the footsteps of the great
Imagineers of the past - Jesus
Christ, Lao Tse Tung, Walt
Disney..."
190,BOB,190,"The role of The New Earth Army is
to RESOLVE CONFLICT world-wide.
Jedis will parachute into war
zones, utilizing sparkly eyes
technique, carrying symbolic
flowers and animals, playing
indigenous music and words of
peace..."
191,BOB (CONT'D),191,What's the sparkly eyes technique?
192,BOB (CONT'D),192,Okay.
193,LYN CASSADY,193,You see it?
194,BOB,194,I think so. (Beat) Lyn?
195,LYN CASSADY,195,Yeah?
196,BOB,196,Who is this Bill Django?
197,LYN CASSADY,197,I don't know where to begin.
198,LYN CASSADY,198,"Bill always said it started for
him when he fell out of a
helicopter in Vietnam."
199,BILL DJANGO,199,"Oh, man..."
200,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),200,Knock-it off! Chris! Knock-it off!
201,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),201,"Will you knock it off? (Climbing
to his feet) Jesus. What do you
think...?"
202,SOLDIER,202,"VC in black pyjamas! One hundred
meters! It's a woman!"
203,BILL DJANGO,203,Okay!
204,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),204,Well!?
205,SOLDIER,205,What?
206,BILL DJANGO,206,"What the fu...! Why isn't anyone
firing?"
207,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),207,TAKE HER OUT!
208,BOB (V.O.),208,"Every single one of Bill's men
fired high. They instinctively
hadn't wanted to shoot another
person. Later Bill would come
across a study by General S.L.A
Marshall, which revealed that only
15-20 percent of fresh soldiers
shot to kill. The rest
aimed high, didn't fire at all, or
pretended to be busy doing
something else."
209,VC WOMAN,209,"Their gentleness is their
strength."
210,BOB (V.O.),210,"Recovering in hospital, Bill wrote
to General T.L Cornplow, Vice
Chief of Staff for the Army,
explaining that he wanted to go on
a fact-finding mission to explore
alternative combat tactics. The
Pentagon agreed to pay his salary
and expenses for the duration of
the journey."
211,BOB (V.O.),211,"What Bill hadn't told the Pentagon
was that he was really looking for
the answer to the riddle of his
vision. How could his men's
gentleness, their general lack of
interest in killing people, how
could this be turned into a
strength? How could love and peace
help win wars? Bill knew where to
go to find out."
212,BOB (V.O.),212,"Bill disappeared into the New Age
Movement for six years."
213,BOB (V.O.),213,"Like all Shamen before him, he had
traversed the wilderness. Now he
was returning to his people, a
changed man."
214,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),214,"He brought with him his
confidential report - The New
Earth Army Manual."
215,BOB,215,Does it direct your powers?
216,LYN CASSADY,216,What?
217,BOB,217,"The cone. Does it direct your
psychic powers or something?"
218,LYN CASSADY,218,No.
219,BOB,219,What does it do?
220,LYN CASSADY,220,It cooks supper.
221,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),221,"Solar. Utilizing the power of the
universe - no pollution, totally
renewable. This is like New Earth
Army technology."
222,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),222,"Pretty mind-blowing, isn't it?
First time I read it, I was
like...what the fuck?"
223,BOB,223,Yes. (Beat) But...
224,LYN CASSADY,224,What?
225,BOB,225,Nothing.
226,LYN CASSADY,226,Go on - what?
227,BOB,227,"Well it's just...it's hard to
believe the Pentagon paid for
this. I mean, it's very
interesting, but there's nothing
in here that's actually
about...fighting?"
228,LYN CASSADY,228,"The New Earth Army was tasked with
preventing conflict. We're a force
of peace, not war. Bill realized
if you want to change the world,
you've got to start by changing
the armies. He was the one that
started the research into non-
lethals."
229,BOB,229,Non-lethals?
230,LYN CASSADY,230,Check this out.
231,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),231,The Predator.
232,BOB,232,"The Predator? (Beat) That's a
plastic blob, Lyn. (Pointing at
the blob) That's a..."
233,BOB (CONT'D),233,OH! OH FUCK! OH...FUCK!
234,LYN CASSADY,234,"You see? You're mine now. The
Predator is completely
biodegradable. It's friendly to
the earth but it can hurt you in a
hundred ways."
235,BOB,235,OWWWWWW!
236,LYN CASSADY,236,"It has warrior functions.(Beat)
And it looks a bit funny. This is
New Earth Army technology."
237,BOB,237,Stop it! Stop hurting me!
238,LYN CASSADY,238,"I bought it on line. What's cool
about it is that you could see
this lying on the ground and you'd
never know it had such lethality."
239,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),239,Eyeballs.
240,BOB,240,No!!!!!
241,BOB,241,I think it's officially night now.
242,LYN CASSADY,242,Piece'a shit.
243,LYN CASSADY,243,"I've got Crohn's. The steroids
help."
244,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),244,"Sometimes there's a need,
Bob. Sometimes people are calling
out for something, even if they
don't know it themselves. And then
a man like Bill appears out of
nowhere, because he heard the
call...."
245,BILL DJANGO,245,"I'd like us to begin this with a
mantra. If we could all breathe in
and then out, holding a long
""eeeeee."""
246,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),246,"Breathe in...(they comply) and
out..."
247,OFFICERS,247,"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
ee."
248,BILL DJANGO,248,"We are a Hollow Army, gentlemen.
Vietnam has crushed our soul. We
are traumatized and melancholic.
We are ashamed. That is why I have
brought you to this place of
Sanctuary. Here we can mend our
wounds and dream our dreams. My
dream is of an America that
will lead the world to paradise,
an America that no longer has an
exploitative view of natural
resources, that no longer promotes
consumption at all costs. I
believe this is America's destiny."
249,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),249,"But to achieve it we must become
the first Superpower to develop
super powers. We must create
Warrior Monks - men and women who
can fall in love with everyone,
sense plant auras, pass through
walls, stop saying mindless
cliches and see into the future. I
want you to JOIN me in this
vision. (Beat) Be ALL you can BE."
250,BOB (V.O.),250,"Amongst Bill's audience that night
was Brigadier General Dean
Hopgood, from the Defense
Intelligence Agency. For some time
the General had been concerned
about information he had been
receiving about Soviet research
into psychic powers."
251,BOB (V.O.),251,"According to some stories the
Soviets were psychically
spying on American bases
and had designed ""psychotronic
generators"" - machines capable of
bombarding the President with
negative energy."
252,BOB (V.O.),252,"They were also conducting sadistic
experiments to see whether animals
had psychic powers."
253,BOB (V.O.),253,"Could they, for instance,
telepathically detect that their
babies were distressed?"
254,BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD,254,Sick bastards...
255,OFFICIAL,255,"But why did the Soviets begin this
type of research?"
256,BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD,256,"Well sir, it looks like they
heard about our attempt to
telepathically communicate with
one of our nuclear subs - the
Nautilus - while it was under the
Polar cap."
257,OFFICIAL,257,What attempt?
258,BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD,258,"There was no attempt, sir. It
seems the story was a French hoax.
But the Russians think the story
about the story being a French
hoax is just a story sir."
259,SECOND OFFICIAL,259,"So, they've started psi research
because they thought we were doing
psi research, when in fact we
weren't doing psi research?"
260,BOB,260,"I didn't...I thought...What are
you doing?"
261,LYN CASSADY,261,Salute to the Sun.
262,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),262,"Okay. We're Oscar Mike. (Getting
up) That's ""On the Move"" soldier."
263,BOB,263,What are you doing?
264,LYN CASSADY,264,Cloud bursting. Keeps me in shape.
265,BOB,265,Really? Which one?
266,LYN CASSADY,266,That one.
267,BOB,267,That one?
268,LYN CASSADY,268,No. That one. The big one.
269,BOB,269,Isn't that one too far away?
270,LYN CASSADY,270,They're all far away.
271,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),271,And it's gone.
272,BOB,272,"Jesus Lyn. You had like the whole
desert to drive in..."
273,LYN CASSADY,273,"Yeah. I'm sorry about that Bob.
Must have got a little bi-
locational there, you know? But
don't worry. Someone'll come along
soon."
274,LYN WHEATON,274,Heads.
275,BOB,275,Right.
276,LYN WHEATON,276,Heads.
277,BOB,277,Right.
278,BOB (CONT'D),278,What's your record at this?
279,LYN WHEATON,279,Two hundred and sixty four. Tails.
280,BOB,280,Right. That's pretty...
281,BOB (CONT'D),281,Oh thank Christ.
282,BOB (CONT'D),282,"Can you help us? We drove into a
rock. Could you take us to a town
or someplace?"
283,BOB (CONT'D),283,Thank you! Thanks so much!
284,BOB,284,"Hi! Hello there. Thanks so much
for this."
285,BOB (CONT'D),285,"Don't know if we would have lasted
much longer. Phew!"
286,BOB (CONT'D),286,"Yeah, it gets pretty hot out here,
huh?"
287,YOUNG IRAQI,287,Deep Purple.
288,BOB,288,"Oh, you speak English? Great. Deep
Purple. Right. You guys like Deep
Purple? You like rock or, or..."
289,BOB (CONT'D),289,Lyn? Is this...is this...?
290,LYN CASSADY,290,Yeah.
291,BOB,291,"We're going to die! I'm going to
be killed by Al Qaeda!"
292,LYN CASSADY,292,I don't think they're Al Qaeda.
293,BOB,293,"Oh what the hell do you know? You
don't know! You don't know
anything! And this is all your
fault!"
294,LYN CASSADY,294,"Bob, there's something I have to
tell you. When I said I was
retired from the unit, that was a
lie. I'm on a mission. DeWitts was
just my cover. I've been
reactivated. I couldn't tell
you because this is a Black Op,
but...I think you have a part to
play. I think that's why you're
with me."
295,BOB,295,"You're an idiot. You want to know
why I'm with you? Because I got
drunk. (Starting to cry a little)
I got drunk and I just wanted to
get into Iraq so I could prove to
my wife I wasn't...just once that
I...And now I'm going to die.
She's right. I'm such a..."
296,LYN CASSADY,296,"Have you heard of Optimum
Trajectory before? (No answer)
Your life is like a river, Bob. If
you're aiming for a goal
that isn't your destiny, you will
always be swimming against the
current. Young Ghandi wants to be
a stock-car racer? Not gonna
happen. Little Anne Frank wants to
be a High School teacher. Tough
titty Anne. That's not your
destiny. But you will go on to
move the hearts and minds of
millions. Find out what your
destiny is and the river will
carry you. Now sometimes events in
life give an individual clues as
to where their Destiny lies."
297,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),297,"Like those doodles you just
""happened"" to draw?"
298,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),298,"This is the Ajna chakra - the
third eye - the symbol of the
Jedi. When I saw you'd drawn
it...well, the Universe gives me a
sign like that, I don't ignore it.
You're meant to be here
with me, Bob. The Jedi inside you
sensed that."
299,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),299,"Now listen to me. I don't think
these guys are FRL's or Mehdi
Army... I think we're talking
standard criminals here, okay?
What they're gonna do is try and
sell us on to another group. We
can't let that happen."
300,BOB,300,"How are we gonna stop them?
There's three of them! And they've
got guns!"
301,LYN CASSADY,301,"We're Jedi, Bob. The Jedi don't
fight with guns. We fight with our
minds."
302,BOB,302,What do you mean?
303,LYN CASSADY,303,"Let's say we have no choice but to
fight with these men. Then
we use visual aesthetics to
instill psychically in the enemy a
disincentive to attack."
304,BOB,304,What do you mean?
305,LYN CASSADY,305,"Okay, you lock eyes with one of
them, you go into a monotone and
you say ""No, I'm not going to
attack you."" You totally relax
your body and your voice. And then
you rip out one of his eyeballs."
306,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),306,"Or you use a pen, stab him in the
neck, create a fountain of blood,
I mean really a fountain, get the
blood to squirt on his buddies.
That's a psychic disincentive,
right there."
307,BOB,307,We haven't got a pen.
308,LYN CASSADY,308,"You're missing the point.
(Standing up) Here let me show you
something. Stand up."
309,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),309,Choke me.
310,BOB,310,Oh...I don't want to Lyn.
311,LYN CASSADY,311,"Choke me. What am I gonna do?
(pointing at his throat) Just
here. Choke. Choke."
312,BOB,312,"I don't think I...there's sharp
edges around here..."
313,LYN CASSADY,313,"C'mon...(making quotation marks
with his fingers) ""Attack me."""
314,BOB,314,"What's with the quotation fingers?
That's like implying I'm you
know...only capable of ironic
attacking or..."
315,LYN CASSADY,315,"Quit jawing, Bob, and choke me."
316,BOB,316,"Well, if I choose to choke you,
what are you going to do?"
317,LYN CASSADY,317,"I'm going to interrupt your
thought pattern."
318,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),318,"See? I hardly moved. Physics wise
there's not much going on. It's
the psychic energy that's
important. (Beat) You okay?"
319,BOB,319,Sharp...edges...
320,LYN CASSADY,320,"You felt fear didn't you? Before
hand?"
321,BOB,321,Yes.
322,LYN CASSADY,322,"Would you say that level of fear
was abnormal for you?"
323,BOB,323,"I don't know. I was pretty
terrified anyway but the fear I
felt on the run-up to the choking
did seem, you know, unusual."
324,LYN CASSADY,324,"You know why? It wasn't you. It
was me. I was inside your head.
Fighting with the Mind."
325,YOUNGER IRAQI,325,Okay. We go.
326,BOB,326,"I'm sorry I freaked out, Lyn."
327,LYN CASSADY,327,"That's okay. You learnt a lesson.
""Whatever you fear most has no
power - it is your fear that has
power."""
328,BOB,328,Huh.
329,LYN CASSADY,329,Oprah.
330,BOB,330,"Uhuh. (Beat) You really don't work
for DeWitts?"
331,LYN CASSADY,331,Just my cover.
332,BOB,332,"Gus Lacey said you ran a dance
studio. That was just cover too,
right?"
333,LYN CASSADY,333,"No. I do run a dance school. I
love dance."
334,BOB,334,"Oh. Okay. (Beat) And you're really
on a mission out here?"
335,LYN CASSADY,335,"In time, Bob."
336,BOB,336,"Were you just kidding me back
there - about me having some Jedi
in me?"
337,LYN CASSADY,337,"We learn to recognize our own kind
after a while. You ever dream
about flying?"
338,BOB,338,Yes.
339,LYN CASSADY,339,That's one of the signs.
340,BOB,340,Do you really think so?
341,LYN CASSADY,341,"Don't you? Haven't you always
really felt you were different?"
342,BOB,342,Yes. Yes I have.
343,LYN CASSADY,343,"That's the way it is for us. We're
the ones who don't fit in as kids."
344,BOB,344,Have you always had powers?
345,LYN CASSADY,345,"Kind of. They used to call me the
Jinx."
346,BOB,346,Why?
347,TECHNICIAN,347,"Foxtrot-117 has launched. Tracking
now. Charlie-Oscar 31.8066667..."
348,VOICE,348,"We just lost contact! Request
status? Oh Crap!"
349,BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD,349,Did you crash those computers?
350,LYN CASSADY,350,Yes sir.
351,BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD,351,Far fucking out...
352,BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD,352,"How'd you feel about a transfer
son?"
353,BILL DJANGO,353,"I am Lieutenant Colonel Bill
Django. From now on, you
will speak only when spoken to,
and the first and last words out
of your mouth will be ""Sir, yes,
sir!"" Do you understand?"
354,RECRUITS,354,"Sir, yes, sir!"
355,BILL DJANGO,355,"If you complete this course you
will be a Psychic Weapon, an Angel
of Death, our enemies Worst
Nightmare! Until then you are
Nothing! Less than Nothing! Do you
understand?"
356,RECRUITS,356,"SIR, YES, SIR!"
357,BILL DJANGO,357,"Yeah, I'm only kidding with that
shit. Okay, what shall we do now?"
358,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),358,Hey! Lets dance!
359,BILL DJANGO,359,"Okay! Give it everything you've
got! That's it!"
360,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),360,What's your name son?
361,LYN CASSADY,361,Lyn Cassady sir.
362,BILL DJANGO,362,Where you from?
363,LYN CASSADY,363,"Opelousas, Louisiana, sir."
364,BILL DJANGO,364,Tough place to grow up?
365,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),365,"You've gotta free your feet before
you can free your mind, Lyn."
366,LYN CASSADY,366,Not much of a dancer sir.
367,BILL DJANGO,367,"But that isn't true is it Lyn? You
can dance. It's just someone told
you not to."
368,LYN'S FATHER,368,Stop acting so fucking QUEER!
369,BILL DJANGO,369,"Well, I'm your commanding officer
Lyn, and I'm ordering you to let
the dance out!"
370,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),370,"C'mon goddamit! DANCE! Let it go!
Let it all go!"
371,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),371,Welcome to the Heroes Journey Lyn.
372,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),372,"Okay remember everyone, we don't
officially exist as a unit so I'm
afraid there's no coffee budget.
Bring your own coffee. Oh, and no
solid food for the first week."
373,SPECIAL FORCES TROOPS,373,"""I don't know but I've been told
Eskimo Pussy is mighty cold..."""
374,JEDI WARRIORS,374,Ommmm...
375,BILL DJANGO,375,"Okay, you're doing very well. Now
feel the next bend..."
376,BILL DJANGO,376,"Okay, only when you're ready."
377,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),377,Think cold! Think real cold!
378,JEDIS,378,"Mother Earth, my life support
system as a soldier, I must drink
your blue water. I pray my boots
will always kiss your face and my
footsteps match your heartbeat. I
am yours and you are mine. I
salute you."
379,BOB (V.O.),379,"After years of feeling like an
oddball Lyn had finally found a
home. At last he was amongst men
who prided themselves on being
different."
380,BOB (V.O.),380,"These were Golden Days for Lyn.
There was something so noble and
pure in Bill's vision that the
Jedis felt themselves inspired to
be more than soldiers. In a world
torn apart by greed and hate they
would be a force for good, for
peace."
381,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),381,"For the first time in his life Lyn
felt truly happy."
382,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),382,"Then into the garden a serpent did
come."
383,BOB (V.O.),383,"Larry Hooper was a failed Sci-Fi
writer from Colorado, recruited to
the Jedis after Brigadier General
Hopgood met him at a spoon-bending
party."
384,BOB (V.O.),384,"Right from the start he had made
himself unpopular with the other
Jedis."
385,LARRY HOOPER,385,"Congratulations Scotty. I'm sorry
it doesn't work out for you two."
386,BOB (V.O.),386,"Larry made it quite clear that he
despised most of the other Jedis."
387,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),387,"But Lyn - Lyn was different.
(Beat) He really hated Lyn."
388,BILL DJANGO,388,A-9.
389,SCOTTY,389,"It's...it's something cylindrical?
I think it's a pencil?"
390,BILL DJANGO,390,Okay. Larry?
391,LARRY HOOPER,391,"This is Larry's Spirit Guide,
Maud. I'm looking into
the cupboard now and I'm
seeing...I'm seeing...a tin mug?"
392,BILL DJANGO,392,Lyn?
393,LYN CASSADY,393,It's a man on a chair.
394,LARRY HOOPER,394,"Oh, no, wait. See, I thought you
said K, not A!"
395,BILL DJANGO,395,"Bravo Zulu, Lyn. Outstanding."
396,BILL DJANGO,396,"Aikido is a vehicle for
harmonizing ourselves with the
Universe and the Way. Look upon
these sessions as an opportunity
to discover yourself and your
training partner in a loving
environment."
397,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),397,"Notice how Lyn's circular motions
turned Larry's
aggression back upon him. Good
work Lyn."
398,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),398,"Larry, go outside, calm down."
399,BOB (V.O.),399,"After a year's training, Lyn was
given his first tasking. A senior
Nato General had been kidnapped by
Red Brigade members in Italy. Bill
was unofficially
asked if his unit would be able to
help find him before it was too
late."
400,LYN CASSADY,400,"We're north of Verona. It's a
little town. There's a lake
nearby. I can see a Cinema. Across
from the Cinema is a shop or,
or...it's a cafe. He's in the
apartment above. The town is
called...it's something sweet.
(Beat) Dolce. It's called Dolce."
401,BOB (V.O.),401,"It's true that the unit never
found out whether any of their
remote viewings were accurate or
not. Nevertheless from that moment
on Lyn's reputation soared."
402,BILL DJANGO,402,"Rank, medals...these things mean
little to the Jedi. But growth in
spirit, in wisdom, in psychic
power, these things earn our
respect."
403,BILL DJANGO (CONT'D),403,"Native Americans believed that
when one received an Eagle
feather, it was the mark of love,
of gratitude and ultimate respect.
Only true Human Beings may carry
the Eagle feather."
404,BOB (V.O.),404,"The word soon got out in the
intelligence community that there
was a sergeant at Fort Bragg who
could find whatever you needed
found. It was as if Lyn could fly
anywhere in the world without
leaving his room."
405,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),405,"As Bill Django said - the Force
truly was strong with this one."
406,YOUNG IRAQI,406,Etaharrak!
407,BOB,407,Lyn?
408,LYN CASSADY,408,"It's okay, Bob. We're not getting
into that truck."
409,YOUNG IRAQI,409,Edkhol!
410,LYN CASSADY,410,Don't move Bob.
411,BOB,411,Are you going to use the Blob?
412,LYN CASSADY,412,"Let's hope it doesn't come to
that."
413,YOUNG IRAQI,413,EDKHOL!
414,LYN CASSADY,414,"You can put your weapon away.
You're not interested in us."
415,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),415,Stay where you are Bob.
416,BOB,416,Shit...shit...
417,LYN CASSADY,417,We can go about our business.
418,BOB,418,"La termi, ana sahafi!"
419,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),419,"Now at the time I thought Lyn was
having some kind of fit here.
Later I discovered what he was
actually doing was performing the
Echmeyer technique."
420,BOB (V.O.),420,"Ben Echmeyer was a Vietnam vet
with sixty-three confirmed kills.
He remains the only non-Korean to
achieve the rank of Master in Kwa
Ra Do. He was one of the Jedi
teachers at Fort Bragg."
421,BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D),421,"It was said he could have a tug of
war with a dozen men and not move
an inch."
422,BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D),422,"He was also able to lift bags of
sand on hooks hung through his
scrotum."
423,JEDI RECRUIT,423,"Sir, what's the practical
application of this?"
424,BOB (V.O.),424,"Another demonstration involved
letting a recruit drive a jeep
over him. This, in the end, was to
be his undoing."
425,BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D),425,"Before his untimely death Ben
caused quite a stir by advocating
his controversial ""shock and awe""
knife attack method."
426,BOB (V.O.),426,"The approach was hailed by some
knife aficionados as revolutionary
but criticized by others who
believed that the leaping and
spinning might lead you to
accidentally stab yourself."
427,BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D),427,"Lyn Cassady, however, became a
firm convert to the style."
428,LYN CASSADY,428,"Ben, you're not forgotten. The
knife you gave me lies next to my
beret. God bless Ben Echmeyer."
429,BOB (V.O.),429,"Of course, Lyn didn't actually
have a knife with him at this
particular time...so I still think
what he did was kinda...reckless."
430,BOB,430,"They're not coming! We're okay! Oh
God, we're gonna be okay!"
431,LYN CASSADY,431,There he is.
432,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),432,"Sir? You're okay! We're Americans.
We're here to help you!"
433,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),433,Oh crap!
434,BOB,434,What happened?
435,LYN CASSADY,435,I think I just ran him over.
436,LYN CASSADY,436,"Sir? Are you okay? (Beat) Bob,
give me a hand here will you?"
437,BOB,437,"Oh shit! Oh shit, they're coming!"
438,NIXON (O.S.),438,"Then I say ""There it is. The
Future!"""
439,NIXON (CONT'D),439,"We play this on these big screens
at the conferences, you know? This
trumpet music blasting out. Every
time I see it, it gets me."
440,NIXON (CONT'D),440,"You a businessman, sir?"
441,NIXON (CONT'D),441,"Yeah, Ali Babas have been
targeting locals lately.(Holding
out his hand) Todd Nixon, Army
Small Business Office."
442,IRAQI MAN,442,Mahmud Daash.
443,NIXON,443,"Ask me what business I'm in,
Muhammad."
444,MAHMUD DAASH,444,"Mahmud. What business are you in
sir?"
445,NIXON,445,"Right now, I'm in the Quality of
Life business."
446,NIXON (CONT'D),446,"We've got 25 million Iraqis out
here who wanna be independent,
wanna make something of their
lives. But more than anything else
they wanna buy stuff. Cell phones,
digital cameras, leisure suits -
you name it. If it sells in
Boston, then we can damn well sell
it in Baghdad! (To Mahmud) Am I
right Muhammad? (To Bob) He knows
what I'm talking about. We've got
Halliburton, Parsons,
Perini...just in the primes.
We're gonna have Macdonalds, we're
gonna have Starbucks...No
corporate tax. It's a gold-rush.
Oh, and by the way, fuck the
French! (Laughing) Did you hear
that shit? Chirac wants to bring
French contractors in? Can you
believe that? Hey, Phil? Raise one
hand if you like the French."
447,THE DRIVER,447,"Raise both your hands if you are
French!"
448,NIXON,448,"Yeah, okay...watch the wheel Phil.
(To Bob) Year Zero boys."
449,LYN CASSADY,449,What's Krom?
450,SECURITY MAN,450,God of War.
451,LYN CASSADY,451,Really? Is that Norse?
452,SECURITY MAN,452,"Conan the Barbarian. S'in the
movie."
453,LYN CASSADY,453,Right.
454,DRIVER,454,"Okay. We're in Indian Country.
Check six."
455,NIXON,455,"I was pretty down for a while
about not getting any trigger time
in this war Bob, but you know what
I've learnt? Our greatest weapon
against evil is commerce. When
these people have quality consumer
items they will no longer want to
kill Americans."
456,NIXON (CONT'D),456,"We're not gonna rest until there's
a satellite dish on every one of
THOSE
roofs."
457,FIRST DRIVER (O.S.),457,"We've got a line for the gas
station here. Are we waiting?"
458,NIXON'S DRIVER,458,"Negative. We'd be way too exposed.
We're taking the station. Go in
fangs out."
459,TEXAN SECURITY MAN,459,Secure the perimeter!
460,TEXAN SECURITY MAN (CONT'D),460,"Give her the go-juice, Eddy!"
461,CHILEAN SECURITY MAN,461,I filled her up last time.
462,TEXAN SECURITY MAN,462,Bullshit.
463,NIXON,463,He did fill her up last time Gary.
464,LYN CASSADY,464,"Not your fault sir. I mean we get
kidnappers in America too,
so...you know. There's always, uh,
bad apples, right?"
465,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),465,"Akhir il ahzan. (May this be the
last of your sorrows.)"
466,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),466,Did I say it wrong?
467,MAHMUD DAASH,467,No...that was right.
468,BOB,468,Lyn?
469,LYN CASSADY,469,What?
470,BOB,470,What are you thinking?
471,LYN CASSADY,471,"Just Mahmud. People try to build
something of their lives,
something lasting, something
good... but there's always someone
wants to smash it up..."
472,BOB (V.O.),472,"Lyn was thinking of Larry Hooper
and the part he had played in the
destruction of the New earth Army.
But, in fairness, the Jedis' own
eccentricities hadn't exactly won
them many allies in the Army."
473,BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D),473,"For example, there was Tim Kootz
who, on being asked to ascertain
the whereabouts of General Manuel
Noriega, had replied..."
474,TIM KOOTZ,474,Ask Angela Lansbury.
475,BILL DJANGO,475,What's that Tim?
476,TIM KOOTZ,476,Ask Angela Lansbury.
477,CIA AGENT,477,We asked Angela Lansbury.
478,BILL DJANGO,478,And?
479,CIA AGENT,479,"She said she didn't know where
General Noriega was."
480,BOB (V.O.),480,"After Bill left, Major Holtz of
Special Forces took command of the
Jedis."
481,BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D),481,"And nothing was ever the same
again."
482,LYN CASSADY,482,I really appreciate this sir.
483,BOB,483,"Jesus Christ. We could'a bought a
map if you'd said."
484,LYN CASSADY,484,"Bedouins have been navigating this
desert for centuries without maps.
You can use a wrist-watch in
conjunction with the sun."
485,BOB,485,Well?
486,LYN CASSADY,486,What?
487,BOB,487,Well...use your watch.
488,LYN CASSADY,488,I haven't got a watch.
489,BOB,489,Oh for the love of...Here...
490,BOB (CONT'D),490,What?
491,LYN CASSADY,491,"This is a digital watch, Bob."
492,BOB,492,So? That's...
493,LYN CASSADY,493,"So you need a watch with hands for
Christ's sake!"
494,BOB,494,"Well how the hell am I supposed to
know?"
495,BOB,495,"I can't breathe properly. I
can't...Oh boy..."
496,LYN CASSADY,496,You're okay.
497,BOB,497,I think I'm bleeding to death.
498,LYN CASSADY,498,"You're not bleeding to death, Bob.
It's shock, okay? It's just the
shock. It'll pass. You're gonna be
okay."
499,BOB,499,"If we'd stayed at the road we
would be safe now! Now we've got
no water, no food or, or...
(noticing Lyn's scanning) Will you
forget about the fucking tantric
currents?"
500,LYN CASSADY,500,You're going to be okay.
501,BOB,501,"Stop saying that! I just got blown
up! I'm in the middle of a desert!
I'M NOT GONNA BE OKAY!"
502,LYN CASSADY,502,"Bob, you're suffering from shock.
If you start panicking now your
heart's gonna stop."
503,BOB,503,"Is that...is that supposed to calm
me down?! (hurrying after him) You
know what color the seats were in
the frigging hotel but you
can't...you wanna observe
something Lyn? Observe the fucking
bomb in the middle of the road!"
504,BOB,504,"Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Lyn. There's no
mission? We're in the middle of
the desert because you heard
voices? There's no one here!
There's no-one fucking here."
505,BOB (CONT'D),505,Lyn!
506,BOB (CONT'D),506,Is it the Crohns?
507,LYN CASSADY,507,I don't have Crohns.
508,BOB,508,What's the matter with you?
509,LYN CASSADY,509,I'm dying.
510,LYN CASSADY (CONT'D),510,I've been murdered.
511,LYN CASSADY,511,"It's gone Bob. I can't find him.
I've lost my power. It's the
curse."
512,BOB,512,What curse?
513,LYN CASSADY,513,"They took this... beautiful thing
we'd been building and they
corrupted it. They destroyed the
New Earth Army."
514,BOB (V.O.),514,"...whereas the army had long felt
fine about doing stuff to goats -
even testing atomic weapons on
them."
515,MAJOR HOLTZ,515,Holy shit.
516,LYN CASSADY,516,"This was the real deal, Bob. I was
at the Gateway. Afterwards I
realized I'd got injured."
517,BOB,517,Huh?
518,LYN CASSADY,518,"Sympathetic injury I guess. I was
bruised all over."
519,BOB,519,"So, it's not that the goat fought
back?"
520,LYN CASSADY,520,Goat didn't have a chance.
521,BOB,521,But...that was it?
522,ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.),522,"In America if I do not like my
cell-phone company I change them.
I am in charge. This is consumer
power."
523,ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.),523,"This is democracy. Let us work
together for that. And please stop
shooting at those who are only
here to help."
524,ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.) (CONT'D),524,"This is an old one from Cat
Stevens. (Correcting himself)
Yusef Islam. That's Yusef Islam."
525,LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D),525,"They're far more open minded then
their predecessors, and they've
out-sourced experimental research
to my company."
526,BOB,526,"""Sick?"""
527,LARRY HOOPER,527,"It's pronounced psi-ike. Psychic
Systems International Corp. Turns
out certain people had heard about
the New Earth Army and were
interested in some of the work we
were doing back then. They got in
touch with me, I got in touch with
Bill."
528,LYN CASSADY,528,You're working for him?
529,LARRY HOOPER,529,"Bill's been looking into
subliminal messaging. (Selecting a
disc) This is one we've designed
to play to our own troops before
combat."
530,BOB,530,"There's a subliminal message in
this?"
531,LARRY HOOPER,531,"This is...""Don't get drunk before
firing heavy machine guns."" We've
got all sort of products in
development.(To Worker) Tell them
one of our new ideas."
532,PSIC WORKER,532,Air bag mine?
533,LARRY HOOPER,533,"Air bag mine. Non-lethal mine,
catapults the fucker up into air.
(To another) Gimme another one."
534,2ND PSIC WORKER,534,"Blast target with pheromones and
then release Attack Bees."
535,LARRY HOOPER,535,"Excellent. Attack Bees. The Forces
of Nature! Another."
536,1ST PSIC WORKER,536,"Project Achilles. We mutilate
enemy corpses and..."
537,LARRY HOOPER,537,"We're not doing that anymore!
(Throwing an eraser at the worker)
Idiot!"
538,LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D),538,"The point is we've got a budget,
we've got supporters. I'm
rebuilding the New Earth Army.
Only this time without the hippy
crap."
539,LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D),539,You okay Bill?
540,BILL DJANGO,540,Gonna get some ice-cream.
541,LARRY HOOPER,541,"You get the odd flash of what he
used to be but... he's pretty
burnt out with the booze."
542,LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D),542,"Ooo, Twizzlers."
543,LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D),543,You want one?
544,LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D),544,"God, I love these things..."
545,SONG (O.S.),545,(Lyrics from chosen song.)
546,BOB,546,What? What is it?
547,LYN CASSADY,547,It's the Dark Side.
548,BOB,548,What are you going to do?
549,BOB (CONT'D),549,Lyn? What are you going to do?
550,LYN CASSADY,550,"It's too late...I'm dying, Bob."
551,LARRY HOOPER,551,Oh. Didn't mean to wake you.
552,LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D),552,Heard you weren't feeling well?
553,LYN CASSADY,553,Just tired.
554,LARRY HOOPER,554,How'd you find us?
555,LYN CASSADY,555,I told you. I remote viewed you.
556,LARRY HOOPER,556,"Scotty Mercer told you, didn't he?"
557,LYN CASSADY,557,No.
558,LARRY HOOPER,558,"Yeah, he did. We told Scotty we
were coming over here, asked him
if he wanted some work."
559,LYN CASSADY,559,I haven't seen Scotty.
560,LARRY HOOPER,560,"That's funny, because he told me
he'd run into you and mentioned
that there might be some jobs
going with us over here. (Beat)
Isn't that why you came, really,
Lyn? You want back in, don't you?"
561,LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D),561,"It can happen. You've only got to
say the word. Could be the new
Golden Age for Psi research."
562,BOB,562,But...we've drunk the water.
563,BILL DJANGO,563,Yeah.
564,ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.),564,"The weather? The weather is going
to be HOT!"
565,ARMY BROADCASTER,565,"I'm guessing. I mean, I haven't
looked at the, the thing but I'd
say it's going to be fucking HOT!
Hot. Hot. Hot."
566,ARMY BROADCASTER (CONT'D),566,"That hurt Greg, you fucking dip-
shit. (Laughing too)You fuckity
fuck dip-shit fuck-hole.
(Remembering something) Hey!
Music!"
567,LYN CASSADY,567,Give me the gun Larry.
568,LARRY HOOPER,568,Wow. I'm hungry.
569,ARMY DJ (O.S.),569,"Hey! More music! (muffled) Get
off, will ya?"
570,LYN CASSADY,570,"Okay, let's go."
571,LYN CASSADY,571,We're very sorry. Ma'assalama.
572,BOB (V.O.),572,"Nobody knows exactly what
happened. The official
story is that their helicopter
must have crashed, either because
they were hit by an RPG or
because...well, that's what
happens when you fly a helicopter
while you're tripping on acid. All
I know is they've never been seen
since. Like all Shaman they
returned to the sky."
573,BOB (V.O.),573,"When I got back home I wrote the
story up. Everything."
574,BOB (V.O.),574,"I sent it to the newspapers, the
radio stations, the TV stations,
because that was what Lyn wanted
me to do. The people needed to
know."
575,BOB (V.O.),575,"I was ready for whatever they
would do to me. I was ready to
disappear. I was ready to go to
prison. I was a Jedi and I was
fighting for the New Earth Army."
