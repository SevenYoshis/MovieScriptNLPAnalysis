1,LITTLE GIRL,1,"Mommy, the men on the mountain...!"
2,MOM,2,"Shhhh. Gone, all gone now."
3,MOM,3,"I'm here. Mommy's always here and no
one can ever hurt you. Safe now...
safe and warm... snug as a bug in a
rug."
4,MOM,4,"I'll sit with you, think you can
sleep?"
5,LITTLE GIRL,5,Turn on the nightlight.
6,MOM,6,Close your eyes now. I love you.
7,SAMANTHA,7,How you holdin' up?
8,EARL,8,Freezing my nuts off.
9,SAMANTHA,9,*Put that away*.
10,BURNOUT,10,Ow! Mrs. Claus is HOT!
11,SAMANTHA,11,"I can't take it, Earl, this dumb
costume is giving me a wedgie. Driving
me crazy, but there's these *kids*
here --"
12,EARL,12,"Right, you don't wanna be rootin' --"
13,SAMANTHA,13,"In front of little Billy, age four,
yeah. ""Look, Mommy, Mrs. Claus chooses
to go butt-mining."""
14,EARL,14,This is little Billy talking?
15,SAMANTHA,15,"Age four, kid's unbelievable."
16,SAMANTHA,16,"I'm too old for this, Earl."
17,EARL,17,"Yeah, yeah. Spare me, I got a prostate
the size of a melon."
18,EARL,18,"Seriously, half my life's a doctor's
hand up my ass, I should marry the
fucker."
19,SAMANTHA,19,"Say that a little louder, there's a
kid in back didn't catch it."
20,EARL,20,"It's not that fucking little Billy
again, is it?"
21,SAMANTHA (V.O.),21,"Eight years. I keep hiring detectives,
but they never find anything."
22,SAMANTHA (V.O.),22,"I was born 3000 days ago on the beach
in New Jersey. I entered the world
fully grown, wearing clothes I don't
remember buying. Nothing in the
pockets but a single key, filed
smooth."
23,SAMANTHA (V.O.),23,"I'm married now. Nice guy, early
forties. I stand naked in the mirror
and try to guess my age. Thirty-five,
maybe. I have lots of scars."
24,SAMANTHA,24,"Hal, I gotta tell you, of all the
Christmas pageants I've seen, this
was by far the most recent."
25,HAL,25,"Aw, honey, I had teenage girls playing
the wise men, what'd you expect?"
26,SAMANTHA,26,Teenage boys?
27,HAL,27,"Well, I thought they did fine."
28,SAMANTHA,28,"Just fine? Come on, it was ground
breaking stuff. The first Nativity
where Joseph stares at the wise men's
tits all night."
29,SAMANTHA,29,"Hey, you!"
30,SAMANTHA (V.O.),30,"Her name is Caitlin. She's my daughter
and when I woke up on that long-ago
day, she was two months grown in my
belly. I don't know who put her there.
I may never. I just know she's mine,
and she's about to turn eight."
31,SAMANTHA (V.O.),31,"3000 days. I teach now, fifth grade.
I have the key, I wear it around my
neck for luck. Except for that, and
my name, all traces of my prior life
are lost."
32,SAMANTHA (V.O.),32,"Was I in love ever...? Did someone
look in my eyes, did I say, ""Darling,
I'll never forget you...?"""
33,SAMANTHA (V.O.),33,"Because fuck me, darling, I managed."
34,CAITLIN,34,"His name is Mr. Perkins, my Mom named
him for me."
35,GIRL #1,35,That's her?
36,GIRL #2,36,That's who?
37,GIRL #1,37,"Her Mom, she's got amnesia."
38,GIRL #2,38,Swear?
39,CAITLIN,39,Swear.
40,GIRL #2,40,Too weird.
41,SAMANTHA,41,Excuse me.
42,SAMANTHA,42,"Hello, girls. Caitlin, I'm going to
help Dad with the refreshments."
43,SAMANTHA,43,Which one's Dad? I forget.
44,SAMANTHA,44,*Kidding*.
45,YOUNG MAN,45,POLICE. DON'T MOVE.
46,MAN ON BED,46,What the hell is this...?!!
47,YOUNG MAN,47,"Don't give me an attitude, sir. You're
assuming I won't shoot your sorry
ass, and everyone knows when you
make an assumption, you make an ass
out of u and mption. I'm Sergeant
Madigan, Vice, and if you cop a 'tude,
jerkoff, I will see to it you spend
the next ten years in prison getting
ass-fucked, and if the case is thrown
out because my arrest is too violent,
then I will personally HIRE men to
ass-fuck you for ten years. So if
you're an ass-fucking fan, go ahead
and mouth off, but meanwhile you're
under arrest for the crime of
prostitution, now shut the fuck up
before I cut out your kneecaps and
use 'em as ashtrays."
48,YOUNG MAN,48,"Officer Donleavy, read him his rights."
49,MAN ON BED,49,"Please, this is my first, I... I've
never done this before, I'll do
anything...!"
50,YOUNG MAN,50,"Sir, listen to me. I understand you're
not a wealthy man, but in light of
the damage this arrest will cause
you, we might be able to make an
arrangement --"
51,MAN IN BED,51,Is he all right...?
52,GIRL,52,We gotta stop using bums.
53,MITCH,53,"Forget it. They looked like cops. We
pulled it off, didn't we?"
54,GIRL,54,It was embarrassing.
55,MITCH,55,"You want I should hire actors, for
Chrissake? These guys are cheap,
they work for food."
56,GIRL,56,"Uh-huh. So, when they puke all over
you is that, like, a refund?"
57,MITCH,57,"Trin, I'm pissin' myself over here,
you're so funny. What's this?"
58,TRIN,58,"New case, honest to God chick with
amnesia. You want the job?"
59,HENESSEY,59,"Yep. Yep, yep, yep."
60,TRIN,60,"Wasn't there a lady on TV named
Samantha? Had a magic nose or
something."
61,HENESSEY,61,"'Bewitched', yeah. Good show. Chick
lived with a faggy guy, then in the
last season it was a different faggy
guy. Okay. Here's what we do; get on
the horn to amnesia chick, tell her
yes. Then tell her in 1967 she
promised to give me a blow job. Worth
a try, right?"
62,HAL,62,"Christ, guy's all over you like a
cheap suit."
63,SAMANTHA,63,"That's funny, there's a cheap suit
all over him like a cheap suit."
64,HAL,64,"Oh, boy. Someone's gotta take my
father home. I'm plowed."
65,SAMANTHA,65,This is all I ever wanted.
66,CAITLIN,66,How would you know?
67,NEWS ANCHOR (ON T.V.),67,"...So much for the flame-swallowing
Santa of Boone County. Meanwhile,
KTVA news journeyed to Upper Sandusky,
where Santa's own *Mrs*. Kringle
turned out to celebrate her hubby's
worldwide tour. After one look at
her, I'm thinking Santa got what he
wanted this Christmas."
68,ONE-EYED JACK,68,"Gotta be fuckin' kidding. No. No
way. SHIIIT!!"
69,EARL,69,"You're married what now, five
years...?"
70,EARL,70,"You and Hal, how often you two...?"
71,SAMANTHA,71,"Stick our fingers in out hands and
pull them out again? Every chance we
get. Shut your piehole."
72,EARL,72,Don't get all snippy...
73,SAMANTHA,73,"Earl, do me a favor. Every few words
say ""hic"" and have bubbles come out
your mouth, okay?"
74,EARL,74,"Goddamnit, I'm not drunk. Would a
drunk man have this much raw talent?"
75,HENESSEY,75,"...and here's the jail here, see...?
Escape chute for the Borian, he's a
dinosaur guy, Moves quick, don't
take no shit neither. See, you can
make him shoot the guard -- ah, hell,
look, I played with it a little
myself, I'm sorry."
76,VOICE (O.S.),76,"TODD, TIME FOR DINNER. NOW."
77,HENESSEY,77,"Hey, you go ahead, um... hope you
like the present."
78,TODD,78,"It's awesome, Dad. Mom, though, she..."
79,TODD,79,"She gets weird. On my birthday, when
you gave me the Schwinn... she called
bicycle stores to see if there'd
been any robberies."
80,HENESSEY,80,Tell her I don't steal them locally.
81,HENESSEY (V.O.),81,"Dear Ma: Filled out the child support
stuff last week. Office got pissed,
under ex-spouse I put ""Spawn of Satan,
Dweller in Eternal Dark."" Just being
honest, Ma, lady wants me to die."
82,HENESSEY (V.O.),82,"I'd go without a ripple, that's the
truth. Ex-con. Ex-husband. Expired.
Thanks, Ma, for hiding the truth
from me for so long. Or maybe you
believed in me. I miss you. I hope
you believed, even for a day. No one
did, Ma. No one at all. It's cold
here. I'm sorry you're dead. Your
son, Mitch."
83,HENESSEY,83,Me. What's up?
84,TRIN (O.S.),84,"Mitch, we got a bite on amnesia
chick's photo. Found a guy remembers
seeing her, fall of '87. He wants
cash, should I grease him?"
85,HENESSEY,85,"Hell, no! Use your head, girl. Let
the fucker squeeze the Charmin."
86,TRIN,86,"You kidding? Guy's hideous. I'll do
it, but we're talking time and a
half. Plus a night on the town when
I get back, and *no cockfights this
time*."
87,SAMANTHA,87,"I want a cigarette, why do I want a
cigarette...?"
88,SAMANTHA,88,What... what do you want...?
89,REFLECTION,89,I want a cigarette.
90,SAMANTHA,90,I don't smoke.
91,REFLECTION,91,You used to.
92,REFLECTION,92,"Relax, you can drop the act. Nice
and smooth, take another hit. There
you go. See how easy it comes back?"
93,REFLECTION,93,"*I'm* coming back. You know that,
don't you? Name's Charly, by the
way. You're gonna love me."
94,HAL,94,"Honey, you can't cook, I'm not wrong
about this."
95,SAMANTHA,95,"I'm *remembering*, Hal. Things are
coming back. Trust me, I'm a chef, I
know it."
96,CAITLIN,96,"Daddy, make her stop!"
97,SAMANTHA,97,"Hush. Go to the garage and get me
something, anything. A veggie, go,
man, go! I'm hot to trot."
98,HAL,98,Tomato.
99,CAITLIN,99,Tomato.
100,HAL,100,"Onion, flying in."
101,SAMANTHA,101,More. Faster.
102,CAITLIN,102,Tomato. Tomato. Tomato.
103,SAMANTHA,103,Uh... chefs do that.
104,MAN,104,"Please, man... I don't know why you
gotta kill me... But use the gun,
not the knife. Please. As a fucking
favor, I'm begging you..."
105,TIMOTHY,105,It'll be over soon.
106,MAN,106,"Jesus, man... I... I'm scared of the
knife... Shit, I can't handle getting
shots at the doctors, man, PLEASE...!"
107,TIMOTHY,107,"Last chance. What do you know about
a town called Santa Claus?"
108,MAN,108,"What is this, *what the fuck is
this*?? I'm FBI, for Chrissake, you
can't do this to me. I don't know
ANYTHING."
109,TIMOTHY,109,No. You don't.
110,TIMOTHY,110,"I can always tell, you know... If
someone's lying to me. A little skill
of mine, something to trot out at
parties."
111,TIMOTHY,111,Timothy.
112,VOICE (O.S.),112,Message from Mr. Daedalus.
113,TIMOTHY,113,I'm listening.
114,VOICE (O.S.),114,"He says he's sorry, but he needs you
right away. Something's come up."
115,TIMOTHY,115,"Nix. I'm just finishing up here.
Then I'm going bunjee jumping."
116,VOICE (O.S.),116,"He's aware of your weekend plans,
and he apologizes."
117,TIMOTHY,117,"All right, what's so fucking
important?"
118,VOICE (O.S.),118,"Your old colleague, One-Eyed Jack...?
Recently escaped from a high-security
prison, as you're aware. But listen
to this: prior to his escape, seems
he saw something on TV that disturbed
him. So much he had to be sedated."
119,TIMOTHY,119,"I saw it, too. It's called ""Empty
Nest."" How the fuck is it my business?"
120,VOICE (O.S.),120,"The man was overheard talking to
himself under sedation."
121,VOICE (O.S.),121,"He said Charly Baltimore's alive,
sir."
122,SUIT,122,"I know it's incredible, sir, but...
if she were alive, I'm thinking she
might be in contact with the old man
in Pennsylvania. Should I --"
123,TIMOTHY,123,"Tap his phone, yes. And tell Daedalus
I'm on my way. Timothy out."
124,SAMANTHA,124,They were on sale.
125,CANADIAN #1,125,"Ooh, j'aimerais la baiser. (Subtitle:
I'd like to fuck her.)"
126,CHECKER,126,"Don't you love hearing people speak
French?"
127,CANADIAN #2,127,"Oui, j'veux etirer celle-la autour
d'une chaise. Comme je le vois, une
femme c'est comme Gumby avec des
seins. (Subtitle: I'll stretch her
over a chair, women are merely Gumbys
with tits.)"
128,HAL,128,Beautiful language.
129,SAMANTHA,129,"*Allez, Gumby etiriait le cou, fils
de pute*."
130,SAMANTHA,130,I speak French.
131,PSYCHIATRIST,131,You do.
132,SAMANTHA,132,"You bet your life, fluent French,
whatever the fuck that means."
133,SAMANTHA,133,"Quand j'étais a l'ecole, Jai eu un
professeur qui s'est fabriqué du
dentifrice!"
134,PSYCHIATRIST,134,"You just said when you were in school,
your teacher was made of toothpaste."
135,SAMANTHA,135,"Right, he was, you got a problem
with that? Pasty Joe, we called him.
Look, the accent's perfect, so piss
off. I'M A FRENCH CHEF, YA-HOO."
136,CAITLIN,136,Put Perkins in the basket. He's luck.
137,SAMANTHA,137,"Mr. Perkins, going in the basket."
138,CAITLIN,138,Are the training wheels off?
139,SAMANTHA,139,"Just pretend they're still there.
Piece of cake. You can do it."
140,CAITLIN,140,Wait...! I'm scared.
141,SAMANTHA,141,"Shhh. Nothing to be scared of. Pretend
you're one of the X-men, you're tough.
Let's go, now. Three, two, one..."
142,CAITLIN,142,"Mom, I can't do it, swear --"
143,CAITLIN,143,"Ouch--! I can't do it, it HURTS-!"
144,SAMANTHA,144,"Nonsense. You can do it. You don't
want to, but you can."
145,CAITLIN,145,"My arm hurts, please take me home...!"
146,SAMANTHA,146,"You can go home, Caitlin. You can
ride there."
147,CAITLIN,147,"Mom, no...!"
148,SAMANTHA,148,"Look, I know you're afraid, that's
the whole *point*, can you see that?
Now stop being a little baby and get
on the damn bike."
149,SAMANTHA,149,"You gonna be afraid of things all
your life? Huh? That what you want?"
150,CAITLIN,150,My wrist hurts...!
151,SAMANTHA,151,"Life is pain. Get used to it. See,
you *will* ride this bike home,
princess. You will ride it and you
will not fall again, *is that
understood*...?"
152,SAMANTHA,152,"Yes, I'm three blocks past the gas
station... Right. Thank you Mr.
Henessey, I'll see you shortly."
153,HAL,153,"She rode all the way home. She didn't
fall, not once. She didn't cry."
154,HAL,154,"You're good. You should work with
kids, you know that?"
155,SAMANTHA,155,"She said her wrist hurt. I didn't
know it was broken, God. I can't
even remember what I said to her...!"
156,HAL,156,"We can still make six o'clock mass,
you coming?"
157,SAMANTHA,157,"A private detective's coming by,
he... he's found something."
158,SAMANTHA,158,"I may have to go away. For a bit.
Now please leave me alone."
159,HAL,159,"Go away. With a detective. Jesus,
it's the holidays, Sam --"
160,SAMANTHA,160,"Are you deaf? I said leave me alone.
Go to church. Drink blood. Drink
some for me."
161,ONE-EYED JACK,161,Evening Charly. Long time.
162,CAITLIN,162,Mommy...!
163,SAMANTHA,163,GET OUUTTTTT!!!!
164,SAMANTHA,164,NO!!!!
165,ONE-EYED JACK,165,"I want my eye back, bitch."
166,ONE-EYED JACK,166,"Goddamn you. Fight me. What's wrong
with you, *fight* me!"
167,SAMANTHA,167,"It took me three seconds. That's...
that's good, huh...?"
168,SAMANTHA,168,Caitlin. We gotta find Caitlin.
169,HENESSEY,169,"Hey--! Slow down. The kid's okay,
she's in my car, what the hell is
going on?"
170,SAMANTHA,170,"That man who tried to hurt us...? If
I stay here... other people will
come. I have to leave. Just for a
little while."
171,SAMANTHA,171,"I want you to light a candle and
keep it in the kitchen window. And
never, *ever* let it go out, because
as long as it burns...? It means
you're thinking of me. And if I'm
alone... if it's dark and I'm lost...
It's how I'll find my way home."
172,SAMANTHA,172,"That's for a portable phone. I keep
it with me, you call me anytime, you
don't worry about the bill. And last
but not least --"
173,SAMANTHA,173,For luck.
174,HAL,174,"No matter what you find, I'm not
scared. Not of you. Not ever..."
175,SAMANTHA,175,"""Movin' in."""
176,HENESSEY,176,Hah?
177,SAMANTHA,177,"It's not linen. The song's not about
linen."
178,HENESSEY,178,Whatever. You cold?
179,SAMANTHA,179,I'm freezing.
180,HENESSEY,180,"Turn on the heater. It doesn't work,
but it makes a very annoying noise
which distracts from the cold."
181,SAMANTHA,181,I'll pass.
182,SAMANTHA,182,"So, you're a former cop. Atlanta,
was it...? Stop me if I'm out of
line, but I'm curious. How did you...
well, succeed? I mean, where six
other detectives failed?"
183,HENESSEY,183,"You kidding? Pure luck. Plus my
secretary used her feminine wiles.
She's got two, one wile per side.
Huge. No kidding, you can see 'em
coming around a corner, you got time
to comb your hair. Nice kid, you'd
dig her."
184,HENESSEY,184,Ah. Here we are.
185,HENESSEY,185,"Putting my glasses in my cooooat..."""
186,HENESSEY,186,"I sing what I do so I'll remember
it. ""Turning off the downstairs

189,ANGUS,189,"""Always after me Lucky Charms."""
190,HENESSEY,190,Thanks. Just needed to hear that.
191,HENESSEY,191,See anything you recognize?
192,SAMANTHA,192,"Yeah, this dirt used to be outside
my window, shut up and let me look."
193,SAMANTHA,193,"I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little
on edge."
194,SAMANTHA,194,I can feel her. Like a ghost.
195,SAMANTHA,195,"We could walk away, you know. There's
still time, we could just... leave
her dead."
196,SAMANTHA,196,Ay-i-yi!
197,SAMANTHA,197,"Size four, no way. You know how long
it's been since I could wear a size
four?"
198,SAMANTHA,198,Can't be mine. Can they...?
199,HENESSEY,199,"Unmailed envelope. Addressed to a
guy."
200,SAMANTHA,200,What's in it?
201,HENESSEY,201,"Another guy's address. Two addresses,
is basically what I'm saying."
202,HENESSEY,202,Anything else in there?
203,SAMANTHA,203,"Hmm...? Uh, no. Just... more clothes."
204,HENESSEY,204,"Yeah, well take a look at this."
205,NATHAN,205,"Alice, please...?"
206,NATHAN,206,"Your dog, Alice. It and my appetite
are mutually exclusive."
207,ALICE,207,What's wrong with the dog?
208,NATHAN,208,"It's simple. He's been licking his
asshole for three straight hours. I
submit to you that there's nothing
there worth more than an hour's
attention, and I should think whatever
he's attempting to dislodge is either
gone for good or there to stay.
*Wouldn't you agree*?"
209,NATHAN,209,Hello?
210,SAMANTHA (O.S.),210,"Hello, Mr. Windeman, I got this number
from a realtor in Pennsylvania. I'd
like to speak with you."
211,NATHAN,211,Who... who is this?
212,SAMANTHA,212,"You tell me, Mr. Windeman."

We don't have time for this, of all
the cocksucking bullshit --"
224,HENESSEY,224,"Whoa. Ms. Class, drive a little truck
on the side, do you?"
225,SAMANTHA,225,"What are you, a Mormon?"
226,HENESSEY,226,"No, ma'am, it's just that... well,
when we met you're all, ""Oh, fooey,
I burned the darn cupcakes."" Now,
you go into a bar, ten minutes later

237,SAMANTHA,237,"HK M-40 assault rifle. At three
hundred yards, vertical drop six
inches."
238,SAMANTHA,238,Shit. He's gonna do the girl.
239,HENESSEY,239,How the fuck can you tell?
240,SAMANTHA,240,I read lips.
241,SAMANTHA,241,See? Took care of it. Knew I could.
242,SAMANTHA,242,Pull over.
243,SAMANTHA,243,"Had to, he... he would've killed
her... Had to... Oh God I took him,
such a good shot... I felt proud of
it, such a shot, Jesus, *how could I
be proud*...?"
244,SAMANTHA,244,I'm scared... I want to go home...
245,PRESIDENT,245,*Mister Perkins*.
246,PRESIDENT,246,"Please, say it again, I'm a little
slow. Better yet, I'll try it. You
lost an operative, a trained
counterassassin, and you just saw
her on TV in a Christmas parade."
247,SILVER-HAIRED MAN,247,"On TV, that's correct. It's two weeks
old, intelligence just caught it."
248,PRESIDENT,248,"You recruited this woman in the late
seventies?"
249,SILVER-HAIRED MAN,249,"For Chapter, yes. I was a friend of
her father's, you see, and... I took
her in."
250,PRESIDENT,250,"Well, it looks like she returned the
favor, now doesn't it?"
251,PRESIDENT,251,"Unbelievable. You people, you dump
this on me, then next week you're
screaming, ""Where's our funding?""
Shit. I'll tell you where it is, can
you say health care?"
252,CIA DIRECTOR,252,"Mr. President, please calm down. The
CIA bears no responsibility for this
problem."
253,PRESIDENT,253,"Thanks for sharing, Kent. How many
double agents you got on the payroll,
last count...?"
254,CIA DIRECTOR,254,"Sir! That controversy has been
thoroughly dealt with, and if there
still exists a leak, perhaps this...
woman agent of his --"
255,SILVER-HAIRED MAN,255,"If I may, sir, Colonel Baltimore
hasn't had classified access since
1987."
256,SILVER-HAIRED MAN,256,"But thank you, Kent, for trying to
fuck me in the ass."
257,SILVER-HAIRED MAN,257,"I'm afraid rooting out double agents
may have to wait. The primary threat
is the woman. Her specialty is
counterassassination, a horseshit
turn of phrase which implies the
other fellow shot first, but in point
of fact she's a takeout artist of
the first order. Nearly disposed of
our friend the Beard down in Cuba a
few years back. Specializes in long
rifles, accurate to a mile and a
half. Presumed dead; now, after eight
years, back in the field, agenda
unknown. She knows enough to hurt
us. I'm frightened. Understand?"
258,PRESIDENT,258,"Yes, yes. I believe you. Just one
question:"
259,PRESIDENT,259,"*What in pluperfect hell is she doing
in a Christmas parade*???"
260,HENESSEY,260,"Aw, cut me a break, Fran. I been out
eight months, I'm back doing skip
traces, now you got me stealing
fuckin' bicycles?"
261,EX-WIFE (O.S.),261,"I don't want you around Todd, hear
me? Shrink told me what those men
did to you in prison. This is a
Christian household, my son's not
gonna develop any... tendencies.
Understand?"
262,SAMANTHA,262,"I still can't believe it. You're
saying my hands didn't even shake...?"
263,SAMANTHA,263,What's the matter with you?
264,HENESSEY,264,"You. You're the matter. Look, you
wanna keep going, good luck. I'm
driving back to Ohio. You're free to
come with me."
265,SAMANTHA,265,What... what are you telling me?
266,HENESSEY,266,"Goddammit, lady, I'm taking you
*home*."
267,SAMANTHA,267,"I'll spell it out for you, ready? I
have no future, *I can't go home*.
Until I know what's happening, I'm
in *prison*, you know how that
feels...?"
268,HENESSEY,268,"Yeah, matter of fact. Four years
inside. Marion, Illinois, real
shithole. Get in the car."
269,SAMANTHA,269,I'm sorry.
270,SAMANTHA,270,Um... what did you...?
271,HENESSEY,271,"Seven years ago, Atlanta PD. Me and
my partner, we handled a lot of
impounded shit. Fucker hated me,
boy. One weekend, when he was
conveniently gone...? Some bearer
bonds disappeared from his office.
And lo and behold, when the police
responded to an anonymous tip, you'll
never guess what just happened to be
sitting in my closet."
272,SAMANTHA,272,"The bonds. Your partner put them
there?"
273,HENESSEY,273,"Hell no, I did, I stole the fucking
things."
274,HENESSEY,274,"Now every dollar I hand my kid, he
asks his mother did I steal it."
275,HENESSEY,275,No more killing.
276,SAMANTHA,276,No more killing.
277,SAMANTHA,277,"It was a helluva shot, wasn't it..."""
278,SAMANTHA,278,Quarter til. Any time now.
279,HENESSEY,279,Nice crowd.
280,SAMANTHA,280,"You're just jealous of their
girlfriends."
281,HENESSEY,281,"Who wouldn't be? Corner booth, there's
a beaut. While you're doing her doggie-
style you can pop the zits on her
back."
282,CNN COMMENTATOR (V.O.),282,"Violence in Northern Ireland continues
today, despite a plea by British
prime minister John Major --"
283,SAMANTHA,283,"I just... got a flash of something,
I..."
284,SAMANTHA,284,I hurt my father.
285,HENESSEY,285,Whoa. You remember your father?
286,SAMANTHA,286,No... that's what's strange.
287,SAMANTHA,287,"If I saw him on the street, I... I
wouldn't... oh."
288,HENESSEY,288,"Ms. Caine, last week at a party I
ran into a girl I knew from college
and we chatted for a few minutes.
And it wasn't til I was driving home
on the freeway that I remembered
that I'd screwed her in the back of
a car once."
289,HENESSEY,289,Everyone forgets.
290,SAMANTHA,290,"That's it? That's your helpful story?
Jesus Christ!"
291,HENESSEY,291,"No, see, all's I'm saying is you're
not alone."
292,SAMANTHA,292,"Oh, shut up."
293,HENESSEY,293,Fine. I gotta use the head.
294,TIMOTHY,294,"For you. Another in a long line of
bad investments."
295,SAMANTHA,295,Excuse me?
296,TIMOTHY,296,Just saw the ring on your finger.
297,TIMOTHY,297,Do I know you from somewhere...?
298,TIMOTHY,298,"Whoa. Back up. Total pickup line,
let's forget I said that."
299,SAMANTHA,299,"Thanks for the drink. But no. I don't
know you."
300,TIMOTHY,300,"No, you don't, do you...? I'd know
if you did. I can tell if someone's
lying."
301,TIMOTHY,301,Sorry to bother you.
302,TIMOTHY,302,"Okay, people, I got what I needed.
Wait until she comes out. Then do
them both."
303,TIMOTHY,303,"Walk soft, we got local law."
304,SAMANTHA,304,What are you doing?
305,HENESSEY,305,Pork. On your nine.
306,SAMANTHA,306,So?
307,HENESSEY,307,"So you shot a guy in the head
yesterday. We wait outside."
308,SAMANTHA,308,It's freezing.
309,HENESSEY,309,"Too bad. People shouldn't shoot other
people in the head. Just themselves.
During that show with the little
girl who's a robot."
310,SAMANTHA,310,Bingo. That's an old guy's car.
311,HENESSEY,311,How do you know?
312,SAMANTHA,312,"Because there's an old guy in it.
Come on."
313,SAMANTHA,313,Gun bulge.
314,HENESSEY,314,"You think I'm gonna shove it down my
pants? Shoot my damn dick off."
315,SAMANTHA,315,So now you're a sharpshooter?
316,HENESSEY,316,"Ho, ho."
317,SAMANTHA,317,Mr. Windeman...?
318,SAMANTHA,318,"Oh, SHIT!"
319,HENESSEY,319,*Jesus wept*...!
320,NATHAN,320,"Get in! Both of you, NOW!"
321,TIMOTHY,321,"East, they're going east. *Head them
off*."
322,NATHAN,322,"Charly. Jesus Christ, I don't believe
what I'm seeing, you're so *fat*."
323,SAMANTHA,323,"I'm... um, I mean... what?"
324,NATHAN,324,"What in God's hell have you been
*eating*, you look positively bovine!
Hang on."
325,SAMANTHA,325,"Oh, God, no more--!"
326,NATHAN,326,Bulletproof. Put it in myself.
327,NATHAN,327,"Charlene, darling --"
328,SAMANTHA,328,My name is Caine. Samantha Caine.
329,NATHAN,329,"Yes, yes, you said that on the phone.
*Must* I point out to you that the
letters in the name SAM CAINE, when
rearranged, spell out AMNESIAC? Your
mind was missing a name, so it simple
invented one that was an anagram of
your current condition."
330,NATHAN,330,"Dammit, Charly. The schoolteacher,
that was your cover! Your memory was
gone, you got confused and you BOUGHT
YOUR OWN COVER. This ridiculous Ohio
housewife business, it's a fantasy,
you *wrote* the bloody thing!"
331,SAMANTHA,331,"It's not a fantasy, *I'm in the
fucking PTA*."
332,NATHAN,332,"Then quit. You're an assassin for
the United States government."
333,NATHAN,333,"I ought to know, I trained you."
334,HENESSEY,334,Beautiful. Fuckin' beautiful.
335,HENESSEY,335,*What happened to bulletproof*?
336,NATHAN,336,"*The side windows were next, I swear*."
337,NATHAN,337,"Here, you might as well have one
too."
338,SAMANTHA,338,My God. How many do you carry?
339,NATHAN,339,"Three. One shoulder, one hip, and
one right next to Mr. Wally --"
340,NATHAN,340,"Where most patdowns never reveal it,
as an agent is often reluctant to
feel up another man's groin."
341,HENESSEY,341,Got a tail.
342,NATHAN,342,"Lucky bastard found the only cool
car in the fucking midwest."
343,NATHAN,343,"Your father was in the British SIS,
assigned to the Irish situation.
After he was murdered in 1971, his
friend Perkins recruited you for
Chapter, a black bag operation working
out of the U.S. State Department."
344,NATHAN,344,"Fall, 1987: Presidential orders come
down. You're to flush out a terrorist
by the name of Daedalus. You never
complete the mission, electing instead
to die, of all things, despite clear
orders to the contrary. And dead you
remain until, without preamble, you
re-emerge, eight years later and
fifteen pounds heavier."
345,SAMANTHA,345,Would you lay off the weight?
346,NATHAN,346,"I think we can safely assume Daedalus
is aware of your resurrection and is
attempting to reverse it. *Damn*, I
can't drive around in this thing."
347,NATHAN,347,"Any idea where we can go to stash
this car?"
348,SAMANTHA,348,"This address...? I... I recognize it
now. I think it belongs to a friend."
349,NATHAN,349,Perhaps you'd best drive.
350,SAMANTHA,350,"Don't be afraid, we don't want to
hurt you."
351,SAMANTHA,351,I just want to know who you are.
352,MAN,352,"CHARLY, BABY!!"
353,LUKE,353,"Look, is this America's Funniest
Practical Videos or something?"
354,NATHAN,354,Let me do it.
355,LUKE,355,"I can't believe you don't remember
dating me. Charly, please, you pursued
me for months."
356,SAMANTHA,356,"Yeah, well. I caught you and forgot
you. Sorry."
357,LUKE,357,"It's December, you'll remember.
Right...?"
358,SAMANTHA,358,"This is ridiculous. What do we do
with this guy?"
359,HENESSEY,359,"Don't ask me, I just work here. Did
you bump pelvises with him or not?"
360,SAMANTHA,360,It's possible.
361,HENESSEY,361,"And you kid, Cathead --"
362,SAMANTHA,362,Caitlin.
363,HENESSEY,363,"Yeah, whatever. Um, could he be
the...?"
364,SAMANTHA,364,I don't know.
365,SAMANTHA,365,"It's coming back, though. All these...
little details about him."
366,SAMANTHA,366,"I know he's got a pin in his leg,
car accident. I know he cuts his own
hair... thinks Rush Limbaugh's an
ass. I know he sits down when he
pees. I know --"
367,HENESSEY,367,Enough. You're giving me a stiffy.
368,LUKE,368,"Goddammit, he's *dying*. Let me call
the poor bastard an ambulance!"
369,NATHAN,369,"*No ambulance*. The car I ordered
will be here soon."
370,SAMANTHA,370,"Mr. Windeman, please let him help
you. I know this man, I... I'm pretty
sure I slept with him."
371,NATHAN,371,"I'm about to faint... And if you
call an ambulance, I will fucking
kill you."
372,NATHAN,372,Where's Charly...?
373,HENESSEY,373,"Relax. She's with Luke. That's his
name, Luke."
374,NATHAN,374,"Goddammit, I told you --"
375,HENESSEY,375,"Yeah, yeah, we weren't real big on
what you told us. I had him call you
an ambulance, so shoot me. Should be
here within fifteen minutes."
376,HENESSEY,376,"The guy's story checks out. Sam knows
things about him. Stuff only a lover
would know."
377,NATHAN,377,Sod that... just watch them.
378,HENESSEY,378,"Don't worry about it. Chick signs my
checks, I'm gonna watch her get aced?
Lie back down."
379,NATHAN,379,"Checks. You're not fooling anyone,
dear boy."
380,NATHAN,380,"You'd wash her feet and drink the
water... wouldn't you?"
381,HENESSEY,381,"Cut me a break, nimrod. She's married
with a kid."
382,NATHAN,382,My star pupil...
383,NATHAN,383,"That man in Pennsylvania yesterday...
The one at the diner, that was hers,
wasn't it...?"
384,HENESSEY,384,How'd you know?
385,NATHAN,385,"I saw the news report, they found a
shell casing a thousand yards away,
helluva shot."
386,HENESSEY,386,"Tell me about Daedalus, what's his
story?"
387,NATHAN,387,"Arms broker, man without a face.
Veteran of Baader-Meinhoff and the
Red Brigades. He's rumored to be
based in the U.S. Doesn't travel
much, they say. Too afraid of metal
detectors, the poor sod's got a foot-
long piece of steel in his leg."
388,HENESSEY,388,Come again?
389,NATHAN,389,"A pin, Mr. Henessey. A surgical pin."
390,HENESSEY,390,"Where the hell...? I know I just
heard that somewhere, something about
a..."
391,HENESSEY,391,"Oh, fuck."
392,HENESSEY,392,"Nathan, that son of a bitch has one
in *his* leg."
393,NATHAN,393,"You blithering idiot, the son of a
bitch wasn't her lover, he was her
target, he's Daedalus!"
394,HENESSEY,394,"Oh, Jesus...! That's how she knew
all that shit, not from *dating* him --
she *studied* the fucker to take him
out!"
395,LUKE,395,"Sure don't look like an ambulance,
does it?"
396,BRIGADIER,396,"...the bombing has been linked to
the Ulster Volunteer Force, which,
as you know, is the counterpart of
the provisional IRA and the most
violent of the Protestant Paramilitary
groups."
397,ANNOUNCER,397,"Despite threats of reprisals,
Brigadier Baltimore repeats that he
will seek to cut UVF supply lines,
especially from Tripoli, Lybia. U.S.
President Nixon concurs that..."
398,GREGORY,398,"You've never made it with a boy,
then?"
399,GIRL,399,"There's nothing odd about it. I'm
only sixteen."
400,GREGORY,400,Rubbish.
401,GIRL,401,What?
402,GREGORY,402,"You're fourteen and not a day more.
Here now, I'm right, you're blushing."
403,GIRL,403,"Look, what if I'm ignorant? It's my
father, we never stay in one place,
I never meet bloody anyone."
404,GREGORY,404,"Saw him on the telly. Think he'd
kill me? I'm a nasty one, I am."
405,GREGORY,405,"You know what, I'll bet you've never
even kissed a boy... now, have you?"
406,GREGORY,406,"Aye, but you want to..."
407,GREGORY,407,"Thanks for shutting off the alarm,
you bloody Papist bitch."
408,GREGORY,408,"Tell the press the Ulster Force claims
full credit."
409,GIRL,409,*DA*!
410,BRIGADIER,410,How much...
411,BRIGADIER,411,...did they pay you...?
412,DAEDALUS,412,"Well, good afternoon. If it isn't
the forgetful spy. How you feeling?"
413,SAMANTHA,413,Not-so fresh.
414,SAMANTHA,414,"You... you're... the man from the
bar...?"
415,TIMOTHY,415,"Look at her. She's not faking it,
she doesn't know me from Adam."
416,DAEDALUS,416,"It's not that I don't trust my
compatriot, Colonel Baltimore. In
fact, I had every confidence that
your amnesia was genuine -- until
you showed up *here*. You follow?"
417,DAEDALUS,417,"Meanwhile, I just got around to
reading the papers, there's the small
matter of an incident upstate. Long
range rifle shot, blew a man out of
his socks."
418,DAEDALUS,418,"You can see where I'm coming from.
I'm trying to pull of the biggest
job of my career. I have to know.
How much you really remember... and
who you've told."
419,SAMANTHA,419,"I didn't tell a soul, I swear."
420,DAEDALUS,420,We'll soon know.
421,SAMANTHA,421,Is... is this a torture thing...?
422,DAEDALUS,422,"Torture, yes. The torturing of
beautiful women, albeit politically
incorrect, is an addiction with me."
423,DAEDALUS,423,"A woman never looks quite so beautiful
as when her face is distended in
pain. Witness the beauty of
childbirth."
424,SAMANTHA,424,"Please, I'm getting all misty. Look,
untie me, I'll make any face you
want."
425,DAEDALUS,425,"Let's not, and say we did. Do you
smoke?"
426,SAMANTHA,426,"Smoke...? Um, no. Not... not really."
427,DAEDALUS,427,"Good. You'll last longer. Now hush
yourself, and take a deep breath.
We're gonna do the torture thing."
428,TIMOTHY,428,"We're running on schedule, I just
secured the tanker. We're borrowing
it from Carbide in South Carolina.
Cargo listed as fire retardant."
429,DAEDALUS,429,"Juice up the bird, we head out soon
as I'm done here."
430,DAEDALUS,430,"Take all the air you can, that's
right. If you need to vomit, do it
now."
431,TIMOTHY,431,"You don't remember *at all*...? The
greatest night of your life, shit,
drown this ungrateful wench."
432,DAEDALUS,432,"Talk to me Colonel. Is my identity
safe...? The truth, and I'll shoot
you in the head. Nice and quick.
Otherwise, you're in for a long night.
*Who did you talk to*?"
433,SAMANTHA,433,...Nobody... fuck you...
434,DAEDALUS,434,"Hate to see you like this, Charly. I
heard you were a helluva spy once."
435,SAMANTHA,435,Watch your back. I'm not done yet.
436,DAEDALUS,436,"That's a very funny joke. You're an
entertaining woman. Good night."
437,TIMOTHY,437,"Okay, I'll signal Daedalus. Your
money will be waiting, and Jack...?
Do yourself a favor, do her and dump
her, I'm serious. Don't get cute,
try to play doctor first. I made
that mistake."
438,CHARLY,438,"Daedalus... Make you a deal... Let
me go now...? I'll leave you the use
of your legs... Bargain, trust me..."
439,DAEDALUS,439,"How did you find me? Who knows about
this place, WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?"
440,CHARLY,440,"I let you touch me, cowboy... I think
I need a bath."
441,DAEDALUS,441,Samantha... Please...!
442,CHARLY,442,Who's Samantha?
443,CHARLY,443,"You see in the movies, badguy says,
""Talk to me and I'll let you live.""
We're gonna run a variation, it goes
like this: Talk to me...? I'll let
you die."
444,CHARLY,444,Where's Henessey...?
445,PERKINS,445,"This can't happen, Harry. The
President's already up at night,
prowling his sock drawer for double
agents, and now we've got a fucking
rogue on our hands."
446,HARRY,446,"Sir, there's someone in the conference
room to see you."
447,PERKINS,447,"Oh, for the love of Christ, who can
be so fucking important?"
448,TIMOTHY,448,"It's me, your poor black cousin. The
one you can't be seen with."
449,PERKINS,449,"*You*...! Are you crazy, coming here??"
450,TIMOTHY,450,My boss is dead.
451,PERKINS,451,What...?
452,TIMOTHY,452,"Your rogue bitch just took him out.
Probably went shopping in his weapons
storage too."
453,TIMOTHY,453,"We're still on, Perkins. I've got
the tanker, the chemist, all ready
to go... but you gotta contain her,
man. We gotta step on her hard and
fast."
454,SWITCHBOARD,454,"You have a call on line three, sir."
455,PERKINS,455,Who is it?
456,SWITCHBOARD,456,"Charly Baltimore, sir."
457,PERKINS,457,Perkins.
458,CHARLY,458,"It's cold, I want to come in."
459,PERKINS,459,"Charly...? Oh, my God, what the hell
are you *doing*? Listen to me, I'm
going to direct you to a safe house,
get you on a plane --"
460,CHARLY,460,"Can the bullshit, I'm not telling
you where I am. I'll come in for a
full debriefing, but we do it my
way."
461,PERKINS,461,"Charly, you're being paranoid. It's
not like it used to be, you're eight
years out of date."
462,CHARLY,462,Do tell.
463,PERKINS,463,"Congress won't authorize a dime,
Charly. Chapter's on the way out,
we've been reduced to a records-
keeping agency, we *don't have enough
money to kill you*, understand...?"
464,CHARLY,464,"Fuck you, Perkins. If you want me
dead, you'll pass a hat in the typing
pool to buy bullets. We do things my
way."
465,PERKINS,465,"Your way, I see. And if I say go to
hell?"
466,CHARLY,466,"From where I stand, it ain't much of
a commute. You'll hear from me."
467,PERKINS,467,"She mustn't threaten our success.
Contain her, whatever it takes. But
be *careful*. If it gets out you're
working for me... we'll both be
grabbing our ankles on the White
House lawn."
468,CHARLY,468,"Hey, Mitch. Glad you're awake. Uh-
oh, you're seeping."
469,CHARLY,469,"Here, look at this."
470,HENESSEY,470,"Ah, that hurt like shit!!"
471,CHARLY,471,That's why I distracted you first.
472,CHARLY,472,Same principle as breaking in virgins.
473,HENESSEY,473,"Same as -- virgins, *what*...?"
474,CHARLY,474,"Saw it in a Harold Robbins book. Guy
bites her on the ear as he goes in.
Distracts from the pain. You ever
try that?"
475,HENESSEY,475,"No, I slug 'em in the jaw and yell
""pop goes the weasel,"" what the fuck
are you talking about? Who are you??"
476,CHARLY,476,"Name's Charly. The spy. Nice to
meet'cha. Drink?"
477,CHARLY,477,"See? Sit next to the dance floor,
every drink's free. People finish
dancing, they think the waiter lifted
'em."
478,HENESSEY,478,I'm confused. Gimme a minute.
479,CHARLY,479,"Take two, they're small."
480,HENESSEY,480,"Okay. Let's say I buy it. You're
actually a trained killer, Jesus, I
can't even say it with a straight
face."
481,HENESSEY,481,"So then... Samantha, she..."
482,CHARLY,482,"Never really existed. Like Nathan
said, she was a total fabrication, I
made her up."
483,HENESSEY,483,"Fabrication. And now she's just...
gone? Forever and ever?"
484,CHARLY,484,"Thank God. Look at my inordinately
large ass, look what she did to me."
485,HENESSEY,485,Pretty convincing act.
486,CHARLY,486,Guess so.
487,HENESSEY,487,"I mean, her personality, it had to
come from *somewhere* --"
488,CHARLY,488,"Change the subject. Better yet, steal
me another drink."
489,HENESSEY,489,Drink up. What's next?
490,CHARLY,490,"I called Chapter. I'm trying to bring
us in from the field alive..."
491,HENESSEY,491,Chapter. Can you trust them?
492,CHARLY,492,"Not sure. Until I know, you might
wanna stay away from curbs."
493,CHARLY,493,"They like to push people in front of
buses."
494,SANTA CLAUS,494,"Hey, lady, Santa want to dance the
lambada wit'choo. *Come this way,
everybody*!"
495,CHARLY,495,"If I could come that way I wouldn't
need to dance the lambada. Follow
me, I need you to do something."
496,HENESSEY,496,"...The lady's whacked, Trin, she's
lost it and I want fucking out, now
*call the Feds*. She's moving us
tonight, I'll sneak out to this phone,
call you back at midnight with the
details."
497,HENESSEY,497,"All right, Charly. What did that
accomplish?"
498,CHARLY,498,"I'm testing our boy Perkins. I figure
he's gotta be tapping your office.
Got a light...?"
499,HENESSEY,499,"Oh, no. He just traced that call?"
500,CHARLY,500,"Come midnight, you hang by the phone.
Nobody shows, we think about trusting
him. He tries to kidnap and torture
you, well, there it is."
501,HENESSEY,501,"Whoa, time out."
502,CHARLY,502,"Oh, don't be such a baby."
503,CHARLY,503,"Ten o'clock, we got two hours to
kill. I'm a woman, feed me."
504,CHARLY,504,"Ugh. God I'm full, I'm gonna have a
food baby."
505,HENESSEY,505,"""Charly."" fucking unbelievable."
506,HENESSEY,506,"Shame about the fat ass. I bet you
were really attractive once."
507,CHARLY,507,"Oh, I was. Check this out. One time?
A guy said he'd fuck me."
508,HENESSEY,508,No.
509,CHARLY,509,Swear to God.
510,HENESSEY,510,Did he make good?
511,CHARLY,511,"Absolutely. Oh, and afterwards? Oh
my God, afterwards I said the most
funny thing, you know what I said...?"
512,CHARLY,512,"I said, ""Go back to your room. Dad..."""
513,CHARLY,513,It's why he thought I had him killed.
514,HENESSEY,514,Your father was murdered.
515,CHARLY,515,"When Da died, I went to his funeral.
12 years old, today I wouldn't. And
I overheard a woman, she was
praying... She was thanking God --
sounded so happy -- thanking Him it
hadn't been *her* father who was
killed. See... she didn't really
care that God had let someone die...
just so long as it missed *her*."
516,CHARLY,516,"...and she bought her cross at the
same store as mine, see, that's what
we do, we all pray to the same cross
on a hundred different walls, and
sit back and wait to see who gets
hit and who gets missed."
517,CHARLY,517,"Fuck the waiting. Fuck being afraid.
I determine who gets hit, and how
hard. And I thank no one. It's
pathetic to thank someone who spares
you -- when they're just taking
someone else."
518,CHARLY,518,Walk me upstairs?
519,CHARLY,519,"This is my first date in eight years,
Mitch. Is this a fun date...?"
520,HENESSEY,520,"Okay, what's going on?"
521,CHARLY,521,"True love, shut the fuck up."
522,HENESSEY,522,"You kidding me? I'm an ex-con, lady.
I wear a shiny suit, my tie's crooked,
and the last time I got blown candy
bars cost a nickel. Plus I'm ugly,
so what's up?"
523,CHARLY,523,Chemistry. Be quiet.
524,HENESSEY,524,"Chemistry my ass. Know what I think?
I think this is why you'd fuck me."
525,HENESSEY,525,"To kill a schoolteacher. Bury any
trace of her."
526,HENESSEY,526,"Sorry, I liked the schoolteacher.
When she comes back, give me a call."
527,HENESSEY,527,"Oh, and call your fuckin' kid, will
ya'? It's two days to Christmas, and
she's under the mistaken impression
that Mommy gives a shit."
528,CHARLY,528,"I didn't ask for the kid, Mitch.
Samantha had the kid, not me, NOBODY
ASKED ME."
529,CHARLY,529,"Easy, baby. She ain't coming back,
no way. Bitch is dead."
530,BEARDED MAN,530,Good evening.
531,CHARLY,531,Fuck off.
532,BEARDED MAN,532,"I see me a good-looking lady, all
upset, I wonder if she doesn't need
some male company."
533,CHARLY,533,"Forget it. I'm saving myself 'til I
get raped."
534,BEARDED MAN,534,"Step into the alley, honey. I ain't
asking, I'm telling."
535,CHARLY,535,"Oh, don't tell me. You're early,
Goddammit, you're supposed to be at
the pay phone. Go away and come back
at midnight. I'm not ready yet. Got
a light?"
536,BEARDED MAN,536,"Lady, I have a gun!"
537,VOICE (V.O.),537,"This ain't no ham on rye, pal."
538,CHARLY,538,What the hell are you doing here?
539,HENESSEY,539,"Saving your life. Woulda got here
sooner but I was thinking up the
sandwich line."
540,CHARLY,540,"You think I couldn't take him?
*Idiot*, you probably scared the
other guy away --"
541,HENESSEY,541,What other guy -- ?
542,CHARLY,542,"Headhunters, nimrod, they go in pairs,
were you always this stupid or did
you take lessons?"
543,HENESSEY,543,I TOOK LESSONS.
544,BEARDED MAN,544,Hey!
545,CHARLY,545,*What*?
546,BEARDED MAN,546,I still got this fucking gun!
547,CHARLY,547,"No, you don't."
548,BEARDED MAN,548,SHIIIIT!!
549,CHARLY,549,Fuck you. Just fuck all of you.
550,CHARLY,550,"Dammit. I knew I couldn't trust that
prick."
551,CHARLY,551,"Easy, Spike. I got myself out of
Beirut once, I think I can get us
out of New Jersey."
552,HENESSEY,552,"Don't be so sure, others have tried.
The entire population, in fact."
553,HENESSEY,553,"Look, about me...? I mean, what's
up, you're this hot survival chick,
I'm getting the feeling you don't
need me anymore."
554,CHARLY,554,Good point.
555,HENESSEY (V.O.),555,"Dear Mom: I was tortured, now I'm in
Atlantic City. The girl of my dreams
just threw me out of a speeding car.
Now more people will come an shoot
me in the head. On the plus side, I
won two bucks at video poker."
556,CHARLY,556,Get in.
557,HENESSEY,557,Found a use for me.
558,CHARLY,558,Yep.
559,CHARLY,559,"I gotta vanish, Mitch. I need money,
a whole bunch."
560,HENESSEY,560,"Why didn't you say so? Gimme a second
while I pull it out of my ass."
561,CHARLY,561,"The key, Mitch. The one I keep around
my neck."
562,HENESSEY,562,What about it?
563,CHARLY,563,"What if I told you it's the key to
Box 406 at Pittsburgh International
Airport?"
564,HENESSEY,564,"How would you know? Someone filed
off the numbers."
565,CHARLY,565,Not someone. Me. I filed them off.
566,CHARLY,566,"There's a briefcase in Box 406, Mitch."
567,HENESSEY,567,What's in it?
568,CHARLY,568,"$200,000."
569,CHARLY,569,"Payment for my last assignment. I
need you to retrieve it for me."
570,HENESSEY,570,Why me?
571,CHARLY,571,"Don't be stupid, they might have the
place covered. I don't want to get
shot to pieces."
572,HENESSEY,572,Shoulda known.
573,HENESSEY,573,Gimme the key.
574,CHARLY,574,"I'd love to. I left it with Caitlin
back in Ohio."
575,HENESSEY,575,"Humor me: you're a paid assassin,
then you fall off a cliff. Sink under
the ocean, and when you come out
you're a fucking schoolmarm, wanna
tell me what happened?"
576,CHARLY,576,"I fell into a school of fish, they
elected me principal. Shut the fuck
up."
577,HENESSEY,577,"Mmmm. Personally...? I'm thinking
maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act.
Maybe you forgot to hate yourself
for eight years, ever think of
that...?"
578,CHARLY,578,"Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Hmmm... Nope,
seems clear enough to me. Hate myself,
Christ almighty. What are you, my
shrink?"
579,HENESSEY,579,"No, just some loser thought he could
maybe understand, fuck it. I been
there, you know. I'd kill for fucking
amnesia. I'm with my boy and all I
can think is I got reamed in the ass
by three guys. Merry Christmas, son,
here's a ball glove, did you know
Daddy screamed when they carved the
name in his back...? Mary, by the
way. I pushed for Cindy, but hell.
God, I'm tired."
580,HENESSEY,580,"I never did one thing right, you
know it, not one fucking thing. Not
even accidental, that takes skill."
581,CHARLY,581,"Drive past, don't slow down."
582,CHARLY,582,"Park under those trees, honk if
there's trouble."
583,HENESSEY,583,"Yas, massah, I be slowin' de caw
down fo' you."
584,CHARLY,584,"Good morning, Raymond."
585,RAYMOND,585,"Um... morning, Ms. Caine."
586,CHARLY,586,"What did we learn about the dangers
of smoking...? Give it here."
587,CHARLY,587,"Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me I'll
blow your fucking head off."
588,AGENT #1,588,"Man, I'd eat a mile of her shit just
to follow it back to the ass it came
from."
589,AGENT #2,589,"Christ, I'm trying to have breakfast."
590,VOICE (O.S.),590,"Unit 2 to Red Dog, give us one more
pass, let's make sure the house is
secure."
591,DRIVER,591,"He's dead. Goddammit, how did that
happen??"
592,BACKSEAT,592,"*Go bulletproof, now*!"
593,TIMOTHY,593,"Wanna be a statistic, lady? You're
about to have 2.4 children."
594,TIMOTHY,594,"I know where you live. Close your
mouth, you look like a fish. Merry
Christmas."
595,DRIVER,595,"Target two, acquired! Red Dog in
pursuit, backup requested."
596,DRIVER,596,You got him?
597,BACKSEAT,597,I got him.
598,HENESSEY,598,Jesus wept.
599,CHARLY,599,"This is gross, this is gonna be so
Goddamn gross..."
600,DRIVER,600,Shit... it really... *is* you...
601,CHARLY,601,"Phil...? Phil Krauss? I don't believe
it, they moved you from cyphers.
Long time, man, I figured you were
dead by now."
602,CHARLY,602,"So, Mitch. Still think I'm warm and
fuzzy?"
603,HENESSEY,603,"Sure. It's not your fault the gun
accidentally went off in mid-air as
you tripped and flew over the car."
604,CHARLY,604,Exactly. What's in the glove box?
605,HENESSEY,605,"Phone bill, Christmas card... Five
buck, swell. You didn't have to kill
him, you know."
606,CHARLY,606,"Back off, man. Do I tell you how to
snap photos of extramarital blowjobs?
No."
607,CHARLY,607,Hello?
608,TIMOTHY (O.S.),608,"It's me, I got your kid. Give your
location, we gotta lose the cellular."
609,CHARLY,609,"State Road 80, 15 minutes west of
Harrison."
610,TIMOTHY,610,"Okay, here's how we do it. Drive to
Harrison, find their main bus stop.
Pay phone, fifteen minutes. Better
drive fast, after five rings I hang
up."
611,HENESSEY,611,What the hell was that?
612,CHARLY,612,"He's got the kid. Doesn't want to
talk on the airwaves, he's routing
me to a land line. A pay phone."
613,HENESSEY,613,Which phone? Where?
614,HENESSEY,614,"Shit. Service centers...! They list
'em on the back of phone bills, right?"
615,CHARLY,615,Excuse me?
616,HENESSEY,616,"Shut up and find me a gun. HK, MP-5."
617,CHARLY,617,Verify you have her.
618,TIMOTHY (O.S.),618,"I got your cellular number off a
cast on her right wrist. Right below
Mommy loves you... Picture of a panda.
Dog, panda, it's got funky ears."
619,TIMOTHY (O.S.),619,"I want money, Charly. I know you've
got numbered accounts, we all do.
I'll let you know where and when.
Fuck with me...? I'll blind the kid
and shoot out her knees."
620,CHARLY,620,"You're dead, motherfucker. We don't
involve families. It's not the way
it's done, *we don't take families*."
621,TIMOTHY,621,I'll be in touch.
622,CHARLY,622,Give me an ANI trace. Do it.
623,TIMOTHY,623,"It's done, she hooked. All I gotta
do is set the ransom meet."
624,PERKINS,624,She mustn't suspect a trap.
625,TIMOTHY,625,"No way. She thinks I'm acting alone,
remember? Say the word, I'll hand
her to you on a plate."
626,PERKINS,626,"God. We're monsters, aren't we...?"
627,PERKINS,627,"Forget Charly. Talk to me about
tonight."
628,TIMOTHY,628,"The tanker's on its way from
Charleston, ETA 1:00 a.m. One
terrorist on ice, waiting to play
patsy."
629,TIMOTHY,629,What's in the sack?
630,PERKINS,630,"That...? Something to prove that I'm
not a complete ogre."
631,PERKINS,631,"See? The young one will have a doll
to play with on Christmas. Very
popular item. It... well, it pees.
You put water in it and... oh, fuck
you."
632,HENESSEY,632,Almost dark now.
633,CHARLY,633,"Another ten minutes. You want my
Crazy Meal action figure?"
634,HENESSEY,634,"Pass. Listen, you sure we're doing
the right thing? We've got money, we
could negotiate..."
635,CHARLY,635,"*I'll get the damn kid*, okay? God,
I hope he doesn't shoot her up. Kid's
dead weight if she's sedated."
636,HENESSEY,636,"Not so emotional, I'm getting
embarrassed with these outbursts
here."
637,CHARLY,637,"Oh, balls. Want me to cry on cue? I
can. This is an extraction, nimrod,
and she's the target, that's how to
play it, the only way to beat this
guy."
638,HENESSEY,638,"Yeah? How come you know so much about
this fucking guy?"
639,CHARLY,639,"Don't go there, Mitch, you don't
want to know."
640,HENESSEY,640,I'm here. Suppose you tell me.
641,CHARLY,641,"Fine, you asked. I bumped pelvises
with this guy. In Paris, back in
1987."
642,CHARLY,642,"I'd been assigned to kill his boss,
remember...? Needed him out of the
way. So I let him seduce me. Had a
steel needle under the pillow, figured
to stick him *en flagrante*, that
means while we were screwing. But he
was too slick. Bashed me in the head,
finished, then threw me in the trunk
of a car. Still think I'm a girl
scout, Mitch...?"
643,CHARLY,643,It's almost dark. Let's get it done.
644,HENESSEY,644,What's the matter?
645,CHARLY,645,They're here.
646,HENESSEY,646,Who?
647,CHARLY,647,"Fucking Chapter, that's who. Timothy
acting alone, Caitlin had a chance.
Now...? She's dead meat."
648,BLUE-SUIT,648,"1800 hours. We're still trying to
clean the tanker --"
649,TIMOTHY,649,"Fuck the cleaning, just drain it and
reload. Chop-chop, I'm going bunjee
jumping after this."
650,HENESSEY,650,Let me go in.
651,CHARLY,651,"Negative. You stomp around like a
forties drunk and you're a lousy
shot."
652,HENESSEY,652,I get by.
653,CHARLY,653,"You couldn't hit a lake if you were
standing on the bottom, now shut the
fuck up."
654,CHARLY,654,I saw a little girl.
655,HENESSEY,655,Come again?
656,CHARLY,656,"That's what happened under the water.
That night, eight years ago."
657,CHARLY,657,"At the end... there she was, this
pretty little girl at the bottom of
the ocean, smiling at me. Three years
old, didn't know Daddies hid in
closets, not yet. Stared up at me in
the strangest way... saying how'd it
come to this, we were so pretty and
perfect, now look at us, sinking
with our head all open... Said when
she grew up she was gonna teach
school. She couldn't wait."
658,CHARLY,658,"Guards are on 27-1 megahertz, meet
me at 26-9, you need to talk. As
soon as you spot me with the kid,
start blowing the charges."
659,CHARLY,659,"They're gonna blow my head off, you
know."
660,CHARLY,660,"This is the last time I'll ever be
pretty."
661,CHARLY,661,"Time now. What I do next, they tell
me it... looks like a machine or
something. You don't like it, don't
look."
662,CHARLY,662,Don't say it.
663,HENESSEY,663,"I was gonna say enjoy life, eat out
more often."
664,CHARLY,664,Gotta go.
665,CHARLY,665,"If she's alive, she's coming out of
there, Mitch. If she's not... they'll
know we stopped by."
666,SENTRY,666,All clear.
667,HENESSEY,667,"Christ, lady, what are you doing in
there, playing fucking mah-jongg?
*Move*."
668,TIMOTHY,668,Bogey.
669,TIMOTHY,669,"Take her alive, Perkins wants her!"
670,VOICE (O.S.),670,"I smell gasoline, you have a little
accident...? I got plenty of matches
up here. Bad way for a kid to go.
Thirty seconds, think it over."
671,TIMOTHY,671,"Good to have you back again, Chuck."
672,PERKINS,672,"You know, Colonel, you ought really
to have stayed dead. You don't know
the rules of the game anymore."
673,CHARLY,673,"No shit. Eight years ago, you send
me to kill Daedalus and this clown.
Now you're working *with* him."
674,PERKINS,674,"Budget cuts, remember? Congress
blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central
America. Across the board, an
intelligence blackout. We had to
recruit any eyes and ears we could
find, even if it meant going to former
targets."
675,CHARLY,675,"Budget cuts... oh, God. Is *that*
what this is about...? The foot
soldiers, the tanker truck... Fuck
me, you're running a fundraiser!!"
676,CHARLY,676,"You'll get all the money you want at
the next budget hearing, won't you...?
All you need is a major terrorist
incident."
677,PERKINS,677,Interesting theory.
678,CHARLY,678,"Theory, my ass. I think some
terrorists were planning a strike.
Bought supplies from Daedalus, that's
how you knew they were coming..."
679,CHARLY,679,"No way. Don't tell me you're gonna
sit there and let them go through
with it, *just to get a budget
increase*."
680,PERKINS,680,"It's not without precedent. 1993,
remember the World Trade Center
bombing...? The CIA had advance
knowledge, don't think they didn't.
Worse, the diplomat who issued the
terrorist's visa was CIA, they
*facilitated* the bombing. Purely to
justify a budget increase. Of course,
they'd no way of knowing the
terrorists would botch the job."
681,CHARLY,681,That's not gonna happen this time...?
682,PERKINS,682,"No. This time, the terrorist event
will come off precisely as planned.
This time the terrorists can't muck
it up... because we've killed them
and taken over."
683,POCK,683,"Found these buried around the
perimeter."
684,TIMOTHY,684,Make sure you get all of them.
685,TIMOTHY,685,"Chuck, you give me the fuck of my
life then try to stick me, come back
from the dead, whack my boss... No
sense lyin', I'm miffed."
686,CHARLY,686,"So what's the plan? What's going out
in the tanker?"
687,CHARLY,687,"What's the plan? I'm gonna die, I
wanna know."
688,TIMOTHY,688,You wanna know the plan?
689,TIMOTHY,689,"Santa Claus -- small town U.S.A.
personified. We drive the chemical
tanker in tonight, park it. Add a
catalyst, chain reaction, it goes
hot. We evacuate. The mix heats
overnight, goes critical at 312
degrees Celsius. 8:00 Christmas
morning... Main Street looks like a
meteor strike."
690,HENESSEY,690,"Are you fucking insane? You're talking
about 10,000 people!!"
691,CHARLY,691,"Easy, Mitch."
692,CHARLY,692,How you gonna blame it on terrorists?
693,TIMOTHY,693,"Those roads are treacherous this
time of year. When we dump a car to
the bottom of a ravine, with the
corpse of Imn Al Rahman in it... get
the picture?"
694,CHARLY,694,"Listen to me, Timothy. Please. Let
my kid go."
695,TIMOTHY,695,Why? For old times' sake...?
696,CHARLY,696,"Goddamn you, *look at her eyes*..."
697,TIMOTHY,697,And why exactly should I do that...?
698,CHARLY,698,"Because they're yours, motherfucker."
699,CHARLY,699,"That night in Paris, I got pregnant.
The little girl's your daughter."
700,TIMOTHY,700,Priceless. Can't believe it...
701,TIMOTHY,701,"Kid's down there. What it is, Charly,
they're gonna find you both frozen
to death in the woods. Suicide pact."
702,CHARLY,702,"She's no risk, Timothy, *let her
go*."
703,TIMOTHY,703,"The freezer's downstairs, Charly.
Let's get it done."
704,HENESSEY,704,I'll wait for you to rescue me.
705,CHARLY,705,Be just a minute.
706,TIMOTHY,706,"Shit, this place is loaded with fumes,
nobody light a fucking match. You
check her for flammables?"
707,GUN GUARD,707,Checked her for colon cancer.
708,CAITLIN,708,Mommy...
709,CHARLY,709,"Shhhhh. Mommy's here, it's okay.
Safe and snug... what comes next,
huh...? What's the next part?"
710,CAITLIN,710,"...bug in a rug... man with white
hair... says the same thing you say..."
711,CHARLY,711,"We're going to take a nap together,
Cate. You can have your dolly, and
Mommy will be next to you, how's
that? It'll be like bears in winter.
When they get cold, see, they fall
deep, deep asleep..."
712,TIMOTHY,712,"Bears, yeah, yeah. Enough."
713,CHARLY,713,"You're murdering us both, cocksucker,
let the kid have her fucking dolly."
714,TIMOTHY,714,"Chuck, I'm not a total creep. I'll
make you a deal, okay? There's a
knife in that box. Now, you and the
kid, you're going to freeze, *but* --
if you kill the kid *by your own
hand*...? I won't kill your husband.
Serious. We're gonna open that door
and you'll both be frozen solid, but
I wanna know that you've cut your
own child's throat."
715,CHARLY,715,"It ain't over, motherfucker. You're
gonna die screaming and I'm gonna
watch. Am I telling the truth...?"
716,CAITLIN,716,"Mom, it's cold in here-!"
717,CHARLY,717,"Shhh. Just for a little bit. Polar
bear, remember?"
718,TIMOTHY,718,"Tell me where Charly keeps her money.
She must have mentioned it."
719,HENESSEY,719,"Get fucked, you dumb bastard. Charly
called Washington, by morning this
whole place'll be crawling with Feds."
720,TIMOTHY,720,"We'll be gone by then, Mitch."
721,HENESSEY,721,"Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying,
there's a couple Feds, they couldn't
sleep, said they might come early.
Fuck you, someone'll screw up. Just
watch."
722,TIMOTHY,722,"Already did, Mitch, someone already
did. Perkins got stuck with a double
agent, someone trusted, highly placed."
723,HENESSEY,723,Who?
724,TIMOTHY,724,Me.
725,TIMOTHY,725,"Chinks are paying me to bring down
Chapter."
726,TIMOTHY,726,"Truck goes, hundreds dead -- rescue
teams within minutes, guess what
they find...?"
727,HENESSEY,727,The patsy.
728,TIMOTHY,728,"Uh-uh. They find Chapter, caught
with their pants down. See, Mitch, I
dumped in a much faster chemical
catalyst..."
729,TIMOTHY,729,"The tanker's gonna blow *tonight*.
In the center of town, thirty-five
minutes from now."
730,CHARLY,730,Open.
731,CHARLY,731,"Gimme a spark... show me, show me..."
732,CHARLY,732,"Come on, come on... do it...!"
733,CHARLY,733,"All this, just one fucking match,
*Goddamit*...!"
734,CAITLIN,734,Mommy...?
735,CAITLIN,735,Don't cry. I keep these here.
736,CAITLIN,736,For lighting your candle.
737,CHARLY,737,"I love you, Caitlin, oh God, do you
know how much I love you...?"
738,CAITLIN,738,Am I gonna die...?
739,CHARLY,739,"No, baby, you're not gonna die. They
are."
740,TIMOTHY,740,"Charly's stash. What's the number of
the locker, Mitch...?"
741,HENESSEY,741,Fuck you.
742,TIMOTHY,742,"Left nut, five bucks I make it."
743,CHARLY,743,"When I tell you, scream as loud as
you can, or else your ears'll get
hurt."
744,CHARLY,744,"Hey, should we buy a dog...?"
745,HENESSEY,745,You foxy bitch.
746,TIMOTHY,746,"Move it out of here, now!"
747,CHARLY,747,"*Run, Catey*."
748,CHARLY,748,"Where'd you go, baby... show Mommy..."
749,NOSY BLUE-SUIT,749,"Hey. Hey, you see that? A little kid --"
750,CHARLY,750,"Smart girl, honey. Stay still. Don't
make a sound. Snug as a bug in a
rug..."
751,HENESSEY (V.O.),751,"Charly, you there? Hello, Charly."
752,CHARLY,752,"Mitch! I don't believe it. Listen,
if you say, ""Are we having fun yet""
I'll rip your nuts off. Where are
you?"
753,HENESSEY,753,"Behind the big garage. Is Caitlin
with you?"
754,CHARLY,754,"No, but she's safe for the moment,
she stowed away on the tanker truck."
755,HENESSEY,755,"Charly, Timothy rigged the tanker to
go off early. We got fifteen minutes.
No more."
756,HENESSEY,756,Hello...! Charly...?
757,CHARLY,757,"Tires won't pop, Mitch. Bastard just
locked her in, she's stuck in there
and they're leaving, *Goddammit*!"
758,HENESSEY,758,"All right, I'll go in and get her,
you watch my back."
759,CHARLY,759,"No chance. I make it twelve, Mitch,
automatic weapons."
760,HENESSEY,760,"So kill 'em for me, bitch, Christ,
what are you good for?"
761,HENESSEY,761,"C'mon, buddy. Do one thing right,
just this once... please..."
762,HENESSEY,762,Piece of cake.
763,CHARLY (V.O.),763,"*Your nine, on your nine*!"
764,CHARLY (V.O.),764,"*30 degrees left, Mitch. Left*."
765,CHARLY (V.O.),765,*Your other left*.
766,CHARLY (V.O.),766,"*Nix, nix, I can't see in there,
don't do it, break right...*!"
767,CHARLY (V.O.),767,"*Fuck me, I was wrong, get outta
threre*!"
768,HENESSEY,768,Gracias.
769,CHARLY (V.O.),769,*De nada*.
770,CHARLY (V.O.),770,"*End run, Mitch, go wide*!"
771,CHARLY (V.O.),771,"*No, Goddamn you, they got you
flanked...*!"
772,HENESSEY (V.O.),772,"Dear Ma: I'm looking at the ants,
they're pretty great. Some really
funny ants here, Ma. All these funny
ants, think I'll stay and watch 'em
awhile..."
773,TIMOTHY (V.O.),773,"I tried to give you a pretty death,
baby. Did my best. Now you're fucked,
now it's ground beef time."
774,CHARLY,774,The truck. How long til it blows?
775,TIMOTHY,775,"Sweet Loretta, you're another animal
entirely. Let's see, 312 degrees...
Make it ten minutes, give or take."
776,CHARLY,776,Then I better hurry.
777,TIMOTHY,777,"Oh, spare me. You made a big noise
and bought five more minutes on the
planet. Give up. Die. I'll spit in
what's left of your face."
778,TIMOTHY,778,"All units converge. Divert local
law, this is a government matter.
Brook no interference, I want the
Baltimore woman eliminated. *Where's
the fucking chopper*?"
779,CHARLY,779,I'm the Missus. Drive.
780,VOICE (O.S.),780,"...yes, she's with Santa Claus,
correct, er, excuse me, the individual
*playing* Santa, er... they're
pursuing the tanker truck, sir."
781,CHARLY,781,"Sorry, man. Government agents, high
level conspiracy."
782,SANTA,782,Fuckin' government.
783,CHARLY,783,Veer left.
784,SANTA,784,Away from the truck?
785,CHARLY,785,"Do it. In five seconds I'm gonna own
that fucking truck."
786,CHARLY,786,"Hang on, Catey."
787,CHARLY,787,"*No, not fair, not fucking fair...*!"
788,CHARLY,788,"Can't stop, Catey, can't..."
789,CHARLY,789,"Suck my dick, every one of you
bastards..."
790,TIMOTHY,790,"Call it four minutes to detonation.
I got a chopper on the way, lots of
time."
791,CHARLY,791,"Oh, honey. Only four inches...?"
792,TIMOTHY,792,You'll feel me.
793,VOICE (O.S.),793,"Point team leader, reporting...
She's... incapacitated the truck...
I'm damaged, sir, I believe I'm
dying... Instructions...?"
794,PERKINS,794,Continue dying. Out.
795,PERKINS,795,"Anthony, get me the President..."
796,TIMOTHY,796,"You've lost a step, Chuck. Muscles
never recovered from C-section, I'll
bet. Am I right?"
797,CHARLY,797,"Please, man... She's only... eight...
she's a beautiful little girl..."
798,TIMOTHY,798,"She's a worthless bitch. I know it
'cause she came out of me."
799,TIMOTHY,799,"It's called shock, Charly... Your
body wants to go into shock..."
800,CHARLY,800,"Fuck you, your breathing's lousy..."
801,TIMOTHY,801,"Look at you. You're out of your
motherfucking league, dearie."
802,CHARLY,802,"...You want a piece...? Take my
shoulder."
803,PILOT,803,"Got her. Heading for the tanker,
thirty yards out. She's all over the
place, something's wrong with her."
804,CHARLY,804,*Cover your ears*.
805,CAITLIN,805,MOMMY...!
806,CHARLY,806,Run... get out...
807,CAITLIN,807,"Don't go away again, Please...!"
808,CHARLY,808,"The truck's a bomb... gonna blow up,
RUN... I'm right behind you, go..."
809,CHARLY,809,...*Go and don't look back*...
810,CAITLIN,810,"*Mommy, no...*!"
811,CAITLIN,811,"It's okay. I'm sorry I left, please
wake up, come on please..."
812,PILOT,812,"Sir, your shoulder --"
813,TIMOTHY,813,"Fuck the shoulder, knee's worse.
Just bring me around and hold her
steady. I'm not leaving until I know
the bitch is dead."
814,CAITLIN,814,"Mommy, get up now. You just stop it,
Mommy, you stop being a little baby.
Stop it, you're not dead, I know
you're not dead so you get up now."
815,CAITLIN,815,"*Don't you die*, you get up now,
Goddammit...! Life is pain, you just
get used to it, and stand up *right
this minute*, Mommy. Life is pain,
do it, you bitch. *Do it*."
816,CHARLY,816,...mommy... here...
817,CHARLY,817,...You're grounded...
818,CHARLY,818,"I'm gonna get the gun, you run for
that car. We go on three, okay? One...
Two... *Three*."
819,CHARLY,819,"Somebody get that motherfucker off
me! I got a kid here, I got my eight
year-old daughter, *Jesus Christ*...!
It's Christmas Eve, who are you
*people*, fucking pull him off! Do
you hear me...?"
820,CHARLY,820,"Distract him, for God's sake give me
ten seconds, please, I'm begging
somebody, anybody, *she's my
daughter*...!"
821,CHAPTER BEAUROCRAT,821,"Negative, ma'am, we understand your
request, but we've decided to go
ahead and let this play out..."
822,TIMOTHY,822,Where are *you* going??
823,CHARLY,823,Suck on it.
824,CHARLY,824,"Die screaming, motherfucker."
825,CAITLIN,825,Hurry! The truck is a bomb!
826,HENESSEY,826,"Yeah, yeah. What else, we got a
fucking lightning rod on the roof...?
No, Caitlin, *don't check*."
827,CHARLY,827,Hey... you're bleeding...
828,HENESSEY,828,I think that's yours...
829,CHARLY,829,"Right, sorry..."
830,CAITLIN,830,"*You're a bad driver! Who said you
could drive*?"
831,TIMOTHY,831,"*Somebody do her, somebody kill that
fucking whore, kill her*!"
832,CAITLIN,832,Don't hit the cars!
833,HENESSEY,833,"Sorry, can't drive... Are you okay...?"
834,CHARLY,834,...Are you... stupid...?
835,HENESSEY,835,"...funny thing...? You aren't going
to die... I am..."
836,CHARLY,836,I know.
837,HENESSEY,837,"Hey, gorgeous... know something...
you got your mother's eyes... don't
let... nobody tell you different..."
838,HENESSEY,838,"Scared... to be nobody... without a
ripple... please... remember me..."
839,HENESSEY,839,...Love you...
840,DOCTOR,840,"Um, Ma'am...? Ambulance is here.
They'll be right in."
841,AIDE,841,"...They'll push for dismantlement of
our apparatus in Chile, but we've
got a degree of plausible
deniability..."
842,VOICE (O.S.),842,Stay very still.
843,CHARLY,843,"Good morning, I'm Charly. The slab
you're standing on is actually a
land mine. Keep your foot on the
pressure plate, nothing happens.
Step off the stone, we'll all be
wearing you."
844,PERKINS,844,"Charly, I know we've treated you
poorly, please, it was just business --"
845,CHARLY,845,"My terms are these. Call State and
order full disclosure on your personal
correspondence. Then disband Chapter,
effective immediately. In exchange...?
I won't shoot you, and I won't make
you stand on that mine. I won't touch
you. I won't touch you. I promise."
846,PERKINS,846,You... you promise.
847,PERKINS,847,"It's done. Now, you promise... you
won't shoot me... won't make me get
on the mine...?"
848,CHARLY,848,I promise.
849,PERKINS,849,"Goddamn you, I can't hold him... You
bitch... YOU FUCKING BITCH...!"
850,CHARLY,850,"Yes, Mr. President, you have my
assurance that Perkins' latest
operation has been rendered beyond
salvage."
851,CHARLY,851,He's not in the greatest shape either.
852,PRESIDENT,852,"I owe you an astounding debt of
thanks, Colonel. Would it be
impertinent to ask if you'd consider
working for State again? The moneys
involved would be substantial."
853,CHARLY,853,"Out of the question. I've got a stack
of papers to grade. Listen, before I
go, I need a small favor..."
854,UNIFORM COP #1,854,"...As I say, we can only apologize
for the system, Ma'am, but it's
confirmed that your husband is
innocent of the crime for which he
was imprisoned. This is a photograph
of the actual criminal..."
855,UNIFORM COP #1,855,"A petty thief, now deceased. I'll
respect your wishes should you choose
to file charges against the State
Attorney..."
856,HAL,856,"Just talked to Dr. Sullivan, she's
gonna need the full braces. Even
with your teaching, insurance won't
cover it... I don't know what to do."
