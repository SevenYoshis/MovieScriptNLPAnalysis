raped?"
78,COP B,78,"Where the fuck have you been? It
happened this morning, up at St.
Dominiek's in Spanish Harlem. A coupla
punks tore up the place and then
gave it to the nuns but good."
79,LT,79,What's going on?
80,FIRST COP,80,"They raped a nun and tore up the
church -- they even took a crap on
the altar. Up in Spanish Harlem."
81,SECOND COP,81,She was only seventeen...
82,FIRST COP,82,Who the fuck could do this?!
83,OLD IRISH COP,83,"The young nun's just a kid from
Ireland. Imagine having to come here
to have that happen!"
84,SECOND COP,84,"Jesus... What's she gonna tell her
mother?"
85,OLD IRISH COP,85,I'm gonna kill those motherfuckers.
86,THIRD COP,86,"The Church already put up a $50,000
reward!"

89,SECOND COP,89,"Anyone got any leads, at all?"
90,FIRST COP,90,"We got shit to go on. Only that list
of inventory -- what they stole from
the church."
91,THIRD COP,91,"Y'know they actually stole those
wacky purple robes? And they took
the chalice -- with the Host still
inside!"
92,SECOND COP,92,What did they want with the Host?
93,THIRD COP,93,"They were hungry. I dunno. They didn't
want to hock the Host, they wanted
to hock that golden chalice."
94,LT,94,"Leave it to the Catholic Church,
man. Girls get raped everyday, and
now they're gonna pay 50 G just
because these chicks wore penguin
suits!"
95,OLD IRISH COP,95,What's your fucking problem?!
96,LT,96,The Church is a racket.
97,OLD IRISH COP,97,So what. Are you a Catholic?
98,LT,98,Sure!
99,OLD IRISH COP,99,Do you believe in God?
100,BET COP,100,"To Hell with this God stuff. How's
that Strawberry? He does what ever
you want him to, huh Lieutenant?
Even strike out!"
101,BET COP,101,"I bet you won a shitload on Oakland.
How much, huh?"
102,LT,102,More than you did.
103,GAMBLER COP TWO,103,"Well, let's see some green!"
104,LT,104,"If you know what's good for you,
you'll keep staying on Oakland!"
105,BET COP,105,Oakland? Is that how you're going?
106,LT,106,"Yeah. Sure. Don't you get it? The
series has gotta last seven games.
The last two did, didn't they? It's
a racket. Do you have any idea how
much money they make selling
television-time for commercials during
the series? Especially if it's a New
York team? They won't close the gold
mine after only four games. It'll
last a full seven. Too many people
wanna milk it for what it's worth.
You'll see!"
107,BET COP,107,"All right... I'm in. After all, you're
the expert. Ain't that right, LT?"
108,LT,108,"You'll be sorry, man. But if you
wanna be a sissy, here's your bread."
109,COP ONE,109,"Strawberry? I thought we were going
with Oakland."
110,LT,110,"We are, man! That's the point! If
the Mets win, it's thanks to
Strawberry. If Oakland wins, it's
thanks to Strawberry. Nothing can
happen out there on the field that
don't gotta do with Strawberry. So
here's to Strawberry!"
111,NURSE,111,Can I help you?
112,LT,112,"I'm in charge of the investigation.
Just checking security."
113,NURSE,113,Security?
114,LT,114,"Do you want those guys coming back?
For the nun? Or for you?"
115,DOCTOR,115,"They inserted a crucifix eleven
centimeters into her vaginal aperture,
breaking the hymen membrane. Then
they pursued the same course with
their natural organs of sexual
penetration. They used a sharp object,
probably a hunting knife with a curved
blade, to carve a cross between her
shoulder blades, entering the flesh
an average of nearly one centimeter
throughout the area of the wound.
They --"
116,LT,116,"Have you ever seen a naked nun? I
tell you, man, I went to school with
the nuns, I've seen hundreds since
then and I've never even seen a nun's
belly button, you understand? But
this nun, let me tell you. What a
beautiful lady..."
117,LT,117,"And where'd the Church get the 50 G
in the first place? The fucking Church
is the biggest scam going. You know
what's the real killer? It costs
$8,000 per kid for them to go to
parochial school. I've got three
kids in there already, with two on
the way! Christ. That fucking reward
is my money, man! But that's Church
policy. The Pope is the world's
biggest bookie. Makes people bet on
their own salvation! Double or nothing
on Heaven. You go to Hell -- then go
to Hell. In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was bullshit."
118,ARIANE,118,"I can't get over what those guys did
to her. I just can't."
119,LT,119,"They're alive, aren't they? Come on,
man! Everyone's making such a fucking
fuss, just because she's a nun. Just
because she wears a penguin suit,
the church puts up 50 G for the guys
who dared to rape her. Do you think
they'd put up a dime if you got raped?
Of course not. Or even for your little
sister? The virgin? Like shit they
would."
120,ARIANE,120,Susie's not a virgin anymore.
121,LT,121,"She's fucking nine years old! Jesus
Christ."
122,ARIANE,122,"And the nun's not a virgin anymore,
either. Will they make her leave the
convent?"
123,LT,123,"Who knows? Who knows what their policy
is."
124,LT,124,"But I'll tell you, man, that nun...
She was beautiful. Just beautiful...
Tall... Real tall... I've never seen
anything like it..."
125,LT,125,"Lite, man... Where the fuck are you?"
126,ARIANE,126,"It's horrible. They burned her breasts
with cigarettes. Christ."
127,LT,127,"Yeah? At least she's alive! I see
people get killed every day! Worse
yet, tortured first and then killed!
The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette
burns. Everyone's all upset about
fucking cigarette burns. I'll show
you cigarette burns!"
128,ARIANE,128,"Do you believe in God? Do you believe
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?."
129,LT,129,"Yeah, I know, I know all about it.
Enough already about the fucking
nuns. Yeah. Yeah. So just take the
bet. Don't give me any hassles, man.
Just put in my bet. 30 G's. Yeah.
And I got $900 from the cops on
Oakland. Yeah. Right. Strawberry's
gonna knock em dead. Of course he
is! You know that! Yeah. Yeah. Have
faith, man! OK. Right."
130,ARIANE,130,Do you believe in God?
131,LT,131,"The Church is a fucking racket. I
know how they operate. I've been
part of the racket since the first
time some faggot priest spilt water
on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was
crying all the way through. Yeah, I
know their game inside out. Now I'm
free of it and I'm gonna stay that
way."
132,ARIANE,132,"I'm not talking about the fucking
Church. Fuck the Church. But tell
me. Do you believe in God?"
133,LT,133,What's to believe?
134,ARIANE,134,"That Jesus Christ was the Son of God
and he came to die for your sins."
135,ARIANE,135,"Your sins, Lieutenant!"
136,ARIANE,136,"And look around you! Where do you
think all this shit came from?"
137,LT,137,People.
138,ARIANE,138,"You believe that man is the be-all
and end-all?"
139,LT,139,Yeah.
140,ARIANE,140,"OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe
in God?"
141,LT,141,"I believe in God the Father Almighty,
Creator of Heaven and Earth..."
142,LT,142,"You wouldn't put some religious trip
on me, would you?"
143,JERSEY GIRL,143,Uh-uh... What?
144,LT,144,Good. Show me your papers.
145,LT,145,"Who's this person? It ain't you, and
it ain't you, so who is it?"
146,GIRL,146,My Aunt.
147,LT,147,"So you took the car from you Aunt.
Stole it. Am I right?"
148,GIRL,148,"We were gonna give it back! We're on
our way home, now!"
149,LT,149,"Yeah, yeah."
150,LT,150,"Now why don't I just call up your
Aunt right now and tell her what's
gone down. How about that?"
151,LT,151,"Well, I'm sure we could arrange
something... Unless you fancy a few
days in jail..."
152,COP 1,152,"Can't you tell us anything? Sisters?
Anything at all?"
153,ELDERLY NUN,153,"They broke my glasses. I didn't see
anything, but I did hear them. They
were young. And there were two of
them. They spoke Spanish. One of
them was named Julio."
154,LT,154,"Julio. Great. There are 20,000 spics
named ""Julio""."
155,ELDERLY NUN,155,"I would tell you more if I could. I
am so sorry, Officers."
156,COP 2,156,"What about you, Sister? Won't you
tell us anything?"
157,MONSIGNOR,157,"Listen. One nun is nearly 80 years
old. I'm not from this Church, of
course, but I assume they'll be
getting her a new pair of glasses.
Apparently she's legally blind without
them. The Sister who suffered a rape
is just 17. She arrived from Ireland
only a couple of months ago. This --
event -- is just too much for them
to take!"
158,MONSIGNOR,158,"Listen. The Church would like to
know who did it just as much as the
NYPD. These arrant criminals broke
the laws of man, and the laws of
God. The Church wants nothing more
than to see them behind bars. That's
why we're offering the $50,000 reward
to whomever brings them in. I'm sure
our hero will be one of New York's
Finest."
159,LITE,159,"OK asshole. You owe thirty grand.
Now what are you gonna do?"
160,LT,160,"I wanna go double or nothing on the
next game."
161,LITE,161,"Double or nothing? Are you fucking
out of your mind?"
162,LT,162,"I'm not gonna let that bastard take
my money"
163,LITE,163,"Take your money? This guy will blow
up your house and everyone in it!"
164,LT,164,"There's just no way the Mets will
lose this game. Gooden is pitching
and Strawberry is ready to break
out."
165,LITE,165,"Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up
owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!"
166,LT,166,"That's my problem. Just put in my
bet."
167,NUN,167,"Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
It has been two days since my last
confession. Father, my sin is a
terrible sin. A sin of omission.
There was another sin that happened
at the same time, and in the same
place, but my sin I think was graver
stil."
168,PRIEST,168,"Sister, we all know what happened to
you yesterday morning. I expected
that you would want to speak to me
about it. But you could have come to
my office. Your being here, in the
confessional, implies that you,
Sister, have done something wrong.
You haven't. I assure you. I feared
you might have misplaced feelings of
guilt. If you condemn yourself because
you experienced feelings of...
curiosity or even... pleasure, you
mustn't --"
169,NUN,169,"Father, if it was so trivial, so
natural, so -- No. I have sinned.
And you must listen if you are to
prescribe an appropriate act of
contrition, and to absolve me. Father,
what would you do if you had but one
day in which to use your arms to
serve God?"
170,PRIEST,170,"It's funny, you knew. But the first
thing I think of is kneading the
bread that I help bake for the soup
kitchen. Maybe that's because my the
muscles in my arms still hurt."
171,NUN,171,"I also thought of that bread, Father.
And of that night six days ago when
the Mother Superior died, and I kept
the cool, damp cloth on her forehead
freshly moist. Father, what would
you do if you had but one day in
which to use your legs to serve God?"
172,PRIEST,172,"I think of running for help, and
falling to my knees in prayer."
173,NUN,173,"As I have prayed day and night since
the desecration of this church
yesterday morning -- and my sin. You
see, Father --"
174,PRIEST,174,"Yes, Sister?"
175,NUN,175,"Yesterday morning, God gave me but
one chance to use something else to
serve Him. Not my arms or my legs,
but something I used for the first
time, for the last time, and will
never use again. My vagina."
176,NUN,176,"Those boys, those sad, raging boys...
They came to me as the needy do. And
like many of the needy, they were
rude. Like all the needy, they took.
And like all the needy, they needed."
177,NUN,177,"Father. I knew them; They learn in
our school. And play in our
schoolyard. And they are good boys."
178,PRIEST,178,You knew them?
179,PRIEST,179,"Who were they, Sister? Who are these
boys? What are the names of these --
good boys you knew?"
180,NUN,180,"I could tell you their names now,
and I know you'd be bound by a sacred
vow to keep my secret. But I cannot
tell you their names. For I, too, am
bound. As I am bound now to confess
my sins. So listen, Father Listen."
181,NUN,181,"I am a nun. What did I give those
boys that they could not have found
elsewhere? Nothing. Nothing at all.
There were always two of us in the
act. The act was half my own. It
does not seem to me the act was half
the act of a once of Christ."
182,NUN,182,"It is the lost chance that will remain
on the ledger of my sins. Not the
loss of my virginity. The rape forced
upon me a choice. As a vessel of the
spirit. I could have imbued my vagina
with God. Or, I could have turned
away from God and voided my body of
spirit, so that all that was left
for those boys was a lump of flesh.
I chose the second path. The easier,
path. The path of the material world.
The path no nun has the right to
take. And so, I sinned."
183,NUN,183,"My vagina spread, but spread no word.
It opened, on nothingness. It gave
nothing at all and left nothing
behind. No trace of my act, yes my
act. For I was there, too, remains
in the landscape of God."
184,NUN,184,"Jesus turned water to wine. I ought
to have turned bitter semen to fertile
sperm -- hatred to love. And maybe
to have saved their souls. They did
not love me. I ought to have loved
them. As Jesus loved those who reviled
him. I ought to have surprised those
boys. Instead, they surprised me,
and got no surprise at all. No, they
did not rape a nun. But a nun has
been raped. And the nun must now
atone for her sin. For a God-given
part of her was wasted. A part which
other women use for procreation, for
conjugal fulfillment, for expressions
of love. I had but one chance. And I
did nothing but react in pain."
185,NUN,185,"When those boys placed their hands
upon my breasts, they had nothing
but an assortment of skin cells in
their grasp. They ought to have felt,
through me. The bosom of their
Redeemer. When they lay on top of me
and looked down into my eyes, they
saw fear. They should have met the
eyes of a lover, And felt the presence
of the Prince of Peace..."
186,NUN,186,"My vagina. I shall never have again.
And never again shall I encounter
two boys whose prayer was more
legible, more poignant, more
anguished. Two young men who threw
themselves upon the altar and took
me with them. And I did nothing for
them. I can only hope that someone
will."
187,LITE,187,Do you have the money?
188,LT,188,What money?
189,LITE,189,Don't bullshit me.
190,LT,190,"I don't got it. Not tonight. You
can't get blood from a stone."
191,LITE,191,This psycho can.
192,LT,192,"Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just
put $120,000 on tomorrow's game."
193,LITE,193,"You're a fucking joke, you know that?"
194,LITE,194,"He's been waiting for the money since
the fucking game ended. And I've
been waiting here since -- forget
it. Listen up. You're gonna get us
both fucking killed. You know that!"
195,LT,195,"Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure
the bet gets in."
196,LITE,196,"You do know that he's gonna blow up
your house, kill your wife and kids --"
197,LT,197,"Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand
for his trouble. I hate that
motherfucking house and --"
198,LITE,198,"He's gonna kill you, man. Do you
hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead.
Get it?"
199,LT,199,"I've been dodging bullets since I
was fourteen. No one can kill me.
I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking
Catholic."
200,LITE,200,How's the case going?
201,LT,201,What case?
202,LITE,202,"The fucking rapists, man. The punks
who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward
from the Church! Remember?"
203,LT,203,"Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime.
Lots of leads. You bet."
204,LITE,204,That 50 G could help you --
205,LT,205,"The Mets are gonna win the Series.
They're a lock."
206,LT,206,"Get this, man. I was at the game
today. Face to fucking face with
Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him
strikeout. And you know what? He
looked at me, and I looked at him,
and he laughed and I laughed and it
was like we were all alone in that
whole stadium and only we understood
that it was all a racket, that he
struck out on purpose, and that he's
saving it up for the Big One.
Tomorrow. Today I understood for the
very first time that --"
207,LITE,207,You've really got a problem.
208,LT,208,"-- that there was never any other
way it could have gone."
209,LT,209,"Never any other way. So you had better
just put in my fucking bet. $120,000
on the last game. The Big One. Come
on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking
what?"
210,LITE,210,"Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's
number You call him yourself and
tell him wnat you want."
211,LITE,211,"You couldn't pay 60. You lose, you'll
be in for 180. To a guy who kills
people for nothing."
212,LITE,212,"I was supposed to meet him at midnight
with the 60. It's already 1:00 AM.
Be careful. I mean it."
213,JC,213,"How are you doing, man?"
214,LT,214,"Very good. Very good. The Mets are
gonna win tomorrow."
215,JC,215,I know. Here. Just a moment.
216,JC,216,"This should be it. Oh, wait."
217,JC,217,Mamacita?
218,JC,218,"There. Now you've got your profit
and more. You'll have more product
day after tomorrow, right?"
219,LT,219,"Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna
win tomorrow."
220,JC,220,I know.
221,JC,221,"Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be
cool."
222,BRASH FEMALE VOICE,222,"Hey motherfucker! Take that backfire
up the ass!"
223,BRASH FEMALE VOICE,223,Fuck you.
224,LT,224,Someone just took a shot at me...
225,ARIANE,225,"Sure, baby Sure And you don't do
cocaine, either."
226,LT,226,"It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's --
it's someone who wants to kill me."
227,LT,227,You gotta believe me!
228,ARIANE,228,Why?
229,LT,229,"Just kick back, baby. Make yourself
at home."
230,LT,230,"But of course it won't be nobody's
home, if you don't come through with
the fucking rent!"
231,LT,231,Hello? Is LARGE there?
232,MOB VOICE,232,No.
233,LT,233,"Look, man. Lite gave ne this number.
OK? Just take a message. Tell Large
to fucking call me right away at 123-
1234. Got it?"
234,MOB VOICE,234,"Sure, I get it..."
235,LT,235,"I'm a good friend of Lite's, man.
It's urgent that --"
236,LT,236,"Christ! Shit! I could kill them all
with my bare hands."
237,ARIANE,237,Who?
238,LT,238,Those fucking Mob assholes.
239,ARIANE,239,"C'mere. You got some good blow, right?"
240,LT,240,Yeah.
241,ARIANE,241,"Then c'mere. I got something for
you."
242,ARIANE,242,"First I'll put your Uptown in the
spoon, then, to make it more exciting,
I'm gonna add some Downtown. They
call this thing a speedball, honey,
but then you must know that..."
243,ARIANE,243,First time shooting up?
244,LT,244,Nah...
245,ARIANE,245,"Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just
like that nun. And I'm gonna rape
you."
246,LT,246,Large?
247,LARGE,247,"All right, cop. I want my money."
248,LT,248,"It's still my money. If you want to
have a chance at any part of it,
shithead, you will take my $120,000
and bet on tomorrow's game."
249,LARGE,249,"What about the money you owe me on
yesterday's game?"
250,LT,250,"Fuck yesterday's game. The World
Series is seven games not six. Put
in my bet."
251,LARGE,251,Let me think about it.
252,LT,252,"There's nothing to think about. Either
you put in my bet or you ain't getting
nothing."
253,LARGE,253,"Oh, really?"
254,LT,254,"Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole,
man. I'm a fucking cop!"
255,LARGE,255,"OK, cop. I want you to give yourself
and your friends on the force a
message. Tell them I've got my own
reasons to be very interested in
whomever did the job on the nuns.
I'll double the Church reward if you
bring those punks direct to me. 100
G cash. Get it?"
256,LT,256,"Fuck the nuns, man! I'm talking about
Strawberry! Is the bet down?"
257,LARGE,257,"Here's the deal: You meet me tonight
across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th.
At the beginning of the Ninth Inning.
We'll listen to the end of the game
together. You bring your cash, I'll
bring mine."
258,LT,258,"Yeah, sucker. You better be there!"
259,LT,259,"Can you believe the nerve of this
fucking guy? He kills people for
fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to
bring in some guys who raped a nun.
What a sick fuck. Man..."
260,ARIANE,260,Who?
261,LT,261,"A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the
rapists if I turn then over direct
to him."
262,ARIANE,262,"But you could do it, baby. We could
use the bread..."
263,LT,263,You mean you could use it.
264,LT,264,"I got it, man! I will find those
kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the
Church! Then the kids'll go to jail.
I'll be in charge, of course. After
a little while, I'll break the fuckers
out -- and I'll turn them in to
shithead I was just talking to. And
pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him
up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it --
'cause I've got the kids. Then, of
course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna
pick up on the Game tonight -- when
the Strawberries win!"
265,ARIANE,265,"""The Strawberries""?"
266,LT,266,"The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another
180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ!
That's almost half a million dollars.
Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough,
I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for
the kids. Then it'll be a perfect
500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G
for the kids. Yeah, it's good I
prepared, or I wouldn't have thought
to --"
267,ARIANE,267,"How come all those guys who're looking
to get 50 from the Church haven't
come up with shit? You got some kinda
inside track?"
268,LT,268,I'm a Catholic.
269,LT,269,"Listen to me, Sister, listen to me
good. The other cops'll just put the
guys through the system. They're
juveniles. They'll walk! Get it? But
I'll beat the system and do justice.
Real justice. For you."
270,NUN,270,I have already forgiven them.
271,LT,271,"Come on lady! They put out cigarettes
on your tits, man! Get with the
program! Don't you want them behind
bars? Or away from the world for
good? How could you forgive these
motherfu -- excuse me. These guys.
How could you? Deep down, don't you
want them to pay for what they did
to you? Don't you want the crime
avenged?"
272,NUN,272,I have forgiven them.
273,LT,273,"Nun! These boys still have their
weapons, Sister. Your forgiveness
will leave blood in its wake. What
if they do it to other nuns? Other
virgins? Old women who die from the
shock? Do you have the rights let
these boys go free? Can you bear the
burden. Sister?"
274,NUN,274,"I have prayed for days, Lieutenant.
I have prayed for the souls of the
boys who raped me. And I have prayed
for my own soul, too. I know what I
must do. And I know what I must not
do."
275,NUN,275,"But you -- you -- it is you who needs
to pray. Now, why do you want to
kill these boys? Why -- really?"
276,LT,276,"Look. Sister. No one has to get
killed. We can solve this together.
You and me -- as one. These boys are
lost sheep. Both Catholic -- did you
know that? And they're sick, Sister.
With a stress of the mind and of the
soul. They need help. Not just jail.
Not just psychiatry. They need the
help that only the Church can give.
Please help me to help them. Help me
find them before the others do. The
night is full of evil men, chasing
these boys with guns and clubs. We
have charity and love on our side. I
know that together, we could find
them first, even in the dark..."
277,NUN,277,"The good reasons are not always the
real reasons. Talk to Jesus,
Lieutenant. Pray."
278,NUN,278,"You do you believe in God -- don't
you? That Jesus Christ died for your
sins?"
279,JESUS,279,I forgive you.
280,LT,280,Me?
281,JESUS,281,I forgive you.
282,LT,282,"You can't forgive me. After what
I've done."
283,LT,283,"I've fucked up bigtime. I've been
bad. Real bad."
284,JESUS,284,I forgive you.
285,LT,285,"Please. Please don't forgive me.
I've always hated you for that."
286,JESUS,286,I forgive you.
287,LT,287,"Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me!
Please! Help me!"
288,LT,288,Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
289,JESUS,289,I forgive you.
290,LT,290,"Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash
the ashes from my forehead, year
after year after year? And why am I
still drunk on your blood, the taste
of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of
all, why can't I feel the nails in
my palms, the spear in my side, the
crown of thorns round my head? Why
do I have to know, over and over,
that it was you. You who died; died
for my sins! And that I will die for
nothing. Why?"
291,JESUS,291,I forgive you.
292,LT,292,"Why do I dream every night of the
whore who brought you water on your
road to death? And why have I never
forgotten that if she, then I --"
293,LT,293,"Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to
be good. Forgive me. Father, for I
have sinned. It's still goddamn good
to be good."
294,JESUS,294,I forgive you.
295,LT,295,"The chalice. Tell me! Who gave it to
you! Tell me where the fuck you got
it! Take me there! Now!"
296,ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN,296,I can't tell you.
297,LT,297,"In the name of God, you must."
298,ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN,298,"My husband will give me Hell, Mister."
299,LT,299,"We've already got Hell, Sister."
300,ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN,300,"It's very hard. He's a -- you're not
a cop, are you?"
301,LT,301,No. Not a cop.
302,ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN,302,"My husband is a fence. He got this
chalice from a couple of kids. Just
yesterday, I think. I stole it out
of his shop so as to return it to
where it ought to be. It's a holy
thing, you know. A holy thing."
303,LT,303,A holy thing.
304,LT,304,Let's go.
305,FENCE,305,You took the chalice.
306,ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN,306,Yes.
307,FENCE,307,"You brought it back to the Church.
And then it made it's way back to
me, again."
308,ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN,308,Yes.
309,ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN,309,"Are you all right, honey?"
310,FENCE,310,I was gonna bring it back myself.
311,FENCE,311,"Jesus, woman! What did you think?
You thought I'd get mad like I did
that time you took that set of pots
and pans? That was twenty years ago.
And how do you compare pots and pans
and a chalice?"
312,LT,312,They both hold stuff you eat.
313,FENCE,313,So what are you doing here?
314,ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN,314,"He wants to know who brought in the
chalice."
315,FENCE,315,"That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo
brought it in,"
316,FENCE,316,"You don't want to hurt those boys,
do you? I mean, they sure as Hell
have got something coming, but it
ain't what the Law wants to give
them. You understand?"
317,FENCE,317,No. How could you understand.
318,FENCE,318,"Well -- maybe you do. But I don't
know where those boys are at right
now. You'll have to ask around. Those
boys on the corner'll know. You'll
have to get it out of them. But they
know."
319,LT,319,"Thank you. And I'll make sure the
chalice gets back where it belongs."
320,LT,320,"Hey -- Have you seen Paolo or Julio
around?"
321,STREET DEALER,321,What the fuck you want.
322,LT,322,"You know, my Uncle used to wear a
walkman all the time. The walkman
looked just like yours. And you look
something like my Uncle. But one day
he was standing in a puddle -- the
puddle locked just like that one --"
323,STREET DEALER,323,And what?
324,LT,324,And he got electrocuted.
325,LT,325,"Look -- I don't know you, and you
don't know me, but I'm really in the
mood to kill someone today and you
are at the end of my gun."
326,LT,326,"Have you ever had days like that?
Yeah, you have, so now you understand
where I'm coming from."
327,LT,327,Tell me! Where is Julio and Paolo ?
328,STREET DEALER,328,"They were at that abandoned building
last night. Second floor. They're
probably still there now. It's next
to the old Convent. Downtown a ways.
You know the place..."
329,JULIO,329,Who the fu--
330,LT,330,Shut up. Let's watch the game.
331,LT,331,Strawberry...
332,PAOLO,332,Yeah...
333,LT,333,Give me the robes.
334,JULIO,334,You're not a cop are you?
335,LT,335,No.
336,LT,336,"Jesus died for your sins, you
motherfuckers! Not me. No. I didn't
die for your sins. No, not me. Jesus
went and did it."
337,LT,337,"So why did you do what you did? If
you want to live, tell me now,
motherfuckers! Tell me now!"
338,LT,338,I forgive you.
339,LT,339,Get out.
340,LT,340,"If you think you're not getting on
this bus, you're dead wrong. No
fucking way are you gonna miss this
bus, man! You were probably the kind
of kids who had your father drive
you to school cause you couldn't
catch the fucking bus. But no more,
man. You're getting on this bus and
you're taking it to the last fucking
stop. So get on the fucking bus,
man, 'cause you're life ain't worth
shit in this town."
