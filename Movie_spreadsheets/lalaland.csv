It was pure insanity."
1,4555,MIA (CONT'D),1,"Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know..."
2,4556,CUSTOMER #1,2,This doesn't taste like almond milk.
3,4557,MIA,3,"Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --"
4,4558,CUSTOMER #1,4,Can I see the carton?
5,4559,CUSTOMER #1 (CONT'D),5,I'll have a black coffee.
6,4560,WOMAN,6,"Cappuccino, please."
7,4561,MANAGER,7,On us.
8,4562,WOMAN,8,"No, I insist."
9,4563,MIA,9,Shit.
10,4564,MANAGER,10,Where do you think you're going?
11,4565,MIA,11,It's -- five past...
12,4566,MANAGER,12,You'd better be here early tomorrow.
13,4567,MIA,13,Ok.
14,4568,MIA (CONT'D),14,"And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It
was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know..."
15,4569,MIA (CONT'D),15,"No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you
waiting `til Denver to tell her...?"
16,4570,MIA (CONT'D),16,Oh. I see...
17,4571,MIA (CONT'D),17,"No, you're right. I understand."
18,4572,MIA (CONT'D),18,Ok... I just... Oh...
19,4573,MIA (CONT'D),19,"No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --"
20,4574,CASTING DIRECTOR,20,One second.
21,4575,CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D),21,"...I'll call her back. Tell her I'm almost
done in here."
22,4576,CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D),22,"You know what? I think we're good. Thanks
for coming in."
23,4577,TRACY,23,Holy Mother of God.
24,4578,TRACY (CONT'D),24,Ever heard of a vent?
25,4579,MIA,25,I wanted to give you an entrance.
26,4580,ALEXIS,26,Mia! How'd it go?
27,4581,MIA,27,Eh...
28,4582,ALEXIS,28,Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?
29,4583,MIA,29,I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.
30,4584,ALEXIS,30,They're the worst.
31,4585,MIA,31,I don't know if they were there.
32,4586,ALEXIS,32,I bet they were.
33,4587,CAITLIN,33,Why is there a convention in the bathroom?
34,4588,TRACY,34,"Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming,
right?"
35,4589,MIA,35,Can't. Working.
36,4590,MIA,36,What?
37,4591,MIA,37,"Did she say ""working""?"
38,4592,MIA,38,Yes?
39,4593,TRACY,39,"Look, I know things didn't go well today.
There are four things in my inbox that
you're perfect for and I will submit you.
But right now -- you're coming."
40,4594,TRACY (CONT'D),40,It'll be fun.
41,4595,MIA,41,"It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed
into one of those glass houses."
42,4596,TRACY,42,Exactly. Fun.
43,4597,TRACY (CONT'D)                        MIA,43,back!
44,4598,ALEXIS,44,"Come on, Mia. When else do you get to
see every Hollywood clich√© crammed
into a single home?"
45,4599,TRACY,45,"Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's
nothing to make fun of. This party will
be humanity at its finest."
46,4600,TRACY,46,No...
47,4601,MIA (CONT'D),47,No...
48,4602,MIA (CONT'D),48,You gotta stop breaking into my home.
49,4603,MIA (CONT'D),49,"You think Mom or Dad would call this a
home?"
50,4604,MIA (CONT'D),50,Please don't sit on that.
51,4605,MIA (CONT'D),51,Are you serious?
52,4606,MIA (CONT'D),52,"Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool.
The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away."
53,4607,MIA (CONT'D),53,I wonder why.
54,4608,MIA (CONT'D),54,I brought you this. It's a throw rug.
55,4609,MIA (CONT'D),55,Don't need it.
56,4610,MIA (CONT'D),56,"Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis
pissed on it?"
57,4611,MIA (CONT'D),57,That's almost insulting...
58,4612,MIA (CONT'D),58,Did he?
59,4613,MIA (CONT'D),59,When are you going to unpack these boxes?
60,4614,MIA (CONT'D),60,When I unpack them in my club.
61,4615,MIA (CONT'D),61,"Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with
you and you're stalking her."
62,4616,MIA (CONT'D),62,"You're not still going by there, are you?"
63,4617,MIA (CONT'D),63,No.
64,4618,MIA (CONT'D),64,"They've turned it into a tapas-samba
place. You believe that?"
65,4619,MIA (CONT'D),65,Seb --
66,4620,MIA (CONT'D),66,Who wants to tapas while they samba?
67,4621,MIA (CONT'D),67,I have someone I want you to meet.
68,4622,MIA (CONT'D),68,I don't want to meet anyone.
69,4623,MIA (CONT'D),69,You'll like her.
70,4624,MIA (CONT'D),70,Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?
71,4625,MIA (CONT'D),71,Probably not.
72,4626,MIA (CONT'D),72,Then what are we gonna talk about?
73,4627,MIA (CONT'D),73,You'll talk about the weather.
74,4628,MIA (CONT'D),74,"Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to
meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart
of gold."
75,4629,Revision                      12.,75,Sebastian --
76,4630,Revision                      12.,76,How long's it been?
77,4631,Revision                      12.,77,"You need to get serious. You live like a
hermit. You're driving without insurance."
78,4632,Revision                      12.,78,"I am serious. I had a very serious plan
for my future. It's not my fault I got
Shanghai'ed."
79,4633,Revision                      12.,79,"You did not get ""Shanghai'ed"", you got
ripped off."
80,4634,Revision                      12.,80,What's the difference?
81,4635,Revision                      12.,81,It's not as romantic as that.
82,4636,Revision                      12.,82,"And everyone knew that guy was shady
except for you."
83,4637,Revision                      12.,83,"Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty
word?"
84,4638,Revision                      12.,84,Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.
85,4639,Revision                      12.,85,"You're acting like life's got me on the
ropes -- what you don't understand is, I
want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life
hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna
make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope."
86,4640,Revision                      12.,86,I love you. Unpack your boxes.
87,4641,Revision                      12.,87,I'm changing the locks.
88,4642,Revision                      12.,88,You can't afford it.
89,4643,Revision                      12.,89,I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes!
90,4644,Revision                      12.,90,Seb.
91,4645,Revision                      12.,91,Bill. Thanks for having me back.
92,4646,Revision                      12.,92,Your welcome. Stick to the set list.
93,4647,SEBASTIAN,93,Of course.
94,4648,SEBASTIAN,94,"Though I don't think they care what I
play."
95,4649,BOSS,95,"I do, and I don't want to hear the free
jazz."
96,4650,SEBASTIAN,96,"How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two
for you, one for me?"
97,4651,SEBASTIAN,97,"Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that
works. Good deal."
98,4652,WAITRESS,98,Well... Welcome back.
99,4653,SEBASTIAN,99,There's a nice way to say that.
100,4654,BOSS,100,...every goddamned night.
101,4655,SEBASTIAN,101,"I'll stick to the set list, I promise --"
102,4656,BOSS,102,Too late. You're done.
103,4657,SEBASTIAN,103,"You're not gonna find a better player. You
know that."
104,4658,BOSS,104,Do you think anyone here gives a shit?
105,4659,MIA,105,"I just wanted to say -- I saw your
playing, and I --"
106,4660,MIA (CONT'D),106,"I don't like the fissure on the GT scan.
Did you test for achromatopsia?"
107,4661,MIA (CONT'D),107,"D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off
at P.D. Damn Miranda Rights."
108,4662,MIA (CONT'D),108,"This is my classroom. You don't like it,
the door's to my left."
109,4663,READER (O.S.),109,Lady why you be trippin' like that?
110,4664,MIA,110,"No, Jamal. You be trippin'."
111,4665,TRACY,111,"There you are! You need to meet someone!
Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer.
CARLO                           TRACY"
112,4666,TRACY,112,town.
113,4667,CARLO,113,They say I have a knack for world-building.
114,4668,MIA,114,Congratulations. I have to grab a drink...
115,4669,SINGER,115,"Alright, one more for y'all before we
break. Do I hear any requests?"
116,4670,MIA,116,"""I Ran""."
117,4671,SINGER,117,"""I Ran"" it is."
118,4672,SINGER,118,"Wanna start us off, piano-man?"
119,4673,SINGER (CONT'D),119,I walked along the avenue...
120,4674,SEBASTIAN,120,Ok. I remember you.
121,4675,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),121,And I'm sorry if I was curt that night.
122,4676,MIA,122,"""Curt""?"
123,4677,SEBASTIAN,123,Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that.
124,4678,MIA,124,Ok.
125,4679,SEBASTIAN,125,"But requesting ""I Ran"" from a serious
musician -- it's too far."
126,4680,MIA,126,"My God. Did you just call yourself ""a
serious musician""?"
127,4681,SEBASTIAN,127,I don't think so.
128,4682,MIA,128,Can I borrow what you're wearing?
129,4683,SEBASTIAN,129,Why?
130,4684,MIA,130,"Because I have an audition next week. I'm
playing a serious fire-fighter."
131,4685,SEBASTIAN,131,"So you're an actress. That makes sense.
Have I seen you in anything?"
132,4686,MIA,132,"Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner
Brothers lot. That's a classic."
133,4687,SEBASTIAN,133,"Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how
you can look down on me from all the way
up there."
134,4688,SINGER,134,Sebastian. Second set.
135,4689,SEBASTIAN,135,He doesn't tell me what to do.
136,4690,MIA,136,He just told you what to do.
137,4691,SEBASTIAN,137,I let him.
138,4692,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),138,What's your name?
139,4693,MIA,139,Mia.
140,4694,SEBASTIAN,140,Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies.
141,4695,SINGER,141,"Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you
did tonight..."
142,4696,CARLO,142,"...Goldilocks from the point of view of
the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox
and Warners are going crazy for it."
143,4697,CARLO (CONT'D),143,"...We're going after Charlize. For the
bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a
franchise. But the thing is it's grounded."
144,4698,MIA,144,George Michael!
145,4699,SEBASTIAN,145,You again.
146,4700,MIA,146,Did you just get your keys?
147,4701,SEBASTIAN,147,...Yeah.
148,4702,MIA,148,Can you grab mine?
149,4703,SEBASTIAN,149,...Which one is it?
150,4704,MIA,150,The Prius.
151,4705,MIA (CONT'D),151,The one with the green ribbon.
152,4706,MIA (CONT'D),152,Shit...
153,4707,SEBASTIAN,153,Those look comfortable.
154,4708,MIA,154,They are...n't.
155,4709,MIA (CONT'D),155,Thank you for saving the day back there.
156,4710,SEBASTIAN,156,You didn't give me much of a choice.
157,4711,MIA,157,"Strange that we keep running into each
other."
158,4712,SEBASTIAN,158,It is strange. Maybe it means something.
159,4713,MIA,159,I doubt it.
160,4714,SEBASTIAN,160,Yeah I don't think so either.
161,4715,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),161,Put the clicker under your chin.
162,4716,MIA,162,What?
163,4717,SEBASTIAN,163,"It turns your head into an antenna.
Probably gives you cancer, but you find
your car more quickly."
164,4718,MIA,164,Uh-huh.
165,4719,SEBASTIAN,165,"You don't live as long, but you get
things done faster, so it all evens out."
166,4720,MIA,166,Oh my God.
167,4721,MIA (CONT'D),167,Eh.
168,4722,SEBASTIAN,168,Not much to look at.
169,4723,MIA,169,Agreed. I've seen better.
170,4724,MIA (CONT'D),170,"Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah,
I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon..."
171,4725,MIA (CONT'D),171,"Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride
to your car?"
172,4726,SEBASTIAN,172,"No, that's fine... Thanks..."
173,4727,MIA,173,...Ok...
174,4728,MIA (CONT'D),174,Night.
175,4729,MIA (CONT'D),175,Are these pastries gluten-free?
176,4730,MIA,176,No...
177,4731,MIA,177,What?? I want a refund.
178,4732,MANAGER,178,You're closing up Friday.
179,4733,MIA,179,I have an audition. Remember?
180,4734,MANAGER,180,Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.
181,4735,MIA,181,But you said --
182,4736,MANAGER,182,And fix your apron.
183,4737,MIA,183,...Hi.
184,4738,MIA,184,What are you doing here?
185,4739,SEBASTIAN,185,Meetings. Studio heads.
186,4740,MIA,186,Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?
187,4741,SEBASTIAN,187,Piece of cake.
188,4742,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),188,"Actually it took me four hours and I
ended up running. We probably have twenty
minutes before the guy finds me. You got
a break coming up?"
189,4743,MIA,189,I'm off in ten.
190,4744,SEBASTIAN,190,Great. I'll hide in the bathroom.
191,4745,MIA,191,"That's the window Ingrid Bergman and
Humphrey Bogart looked out of in
Casablanca."
192,4746,SEBASTIAN,192,What's your Bogart's name...?
193,4747,SEBASTIAN,193,Is it Greg?
194,4748,MIA,194,Yeah. Greg.
195,4749,SEBASTIAN,195,How long have...?
196,4750,MIA,196,"We've been seeing each other for a few
months."
197,4751,MIA (CONT'D),197,"I love this stuff. Makes coming to work
easier."
198,4752,SEBASTIAN,198,"I know what you mean. I get breakfast
five miles out of the way just to sit
outside a jazz club."
199,4753,MIA,199,Oh yeah?
200,4754,SEBASTIAN,200,"It was called Van Beek. The swing bands
played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb."
201,4755,SEBASTIAN,201,It's a samba-tapas place now.
202,4756,MIA,202,A what?
203,4757,SEBASTIAN,203,"Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on
history."
204,4758,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),204,"Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything
and they value nothing."
205,4759,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),205,Clear the frame!
206,4760,MIA,206,We need to wait here.
207,4761,SEBASTIAN,207,"I know. They shoot movies on my street.
""C-stands."" ""Apple box."" ""Don't forget to
sign out."""
208,4762,SEBASTIAN,208,Quiet on set!
209,4763,SEBASTIAN,209,How'd you get into all this?
210,4764,MIA,210,"Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an
actress. She was in this traveling
theater company... And there was this
little library across the street from my
house when I was growing up. This was
Boulder City, Nevada -- every house
looked exactly the same. I was ten and
already I needed to get out. And one day,
my aunt flew into town, and she showed me
the library's old-movie section. We spent
a whole day watching one after the other.
Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca."
211,4765,MIA,211,I never knew the world was so big.
212,4766,MIA,212,Cut!
213,4767,MIA,213,"I started putting on plays in my garage.
I'd write the scripts and print up
programs, and she'd give me props to use
from wherever she'd just been -- New
York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet
off again and I wouldn't hear from her
for another year."
214,4768,SEBASTIAN,214,"Who would you invite to watch? Your
parents?"
215,4769,MIA,215,"God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That
would have been terrifying."
216,4770,MIA (CONT'D),216,"Honestly, I wish I loved something else.
I've tried so hard to want other things."
217,4771,MIA (CONT'D),217,"I left school after two years to come here,
my fourth manager just dropped me, and my
last audition was for a teen soap pitched
as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C."
218,4772,MIA (CONT'D),218,Should've been a lawyer.
219,4773,SEBASTIAN,219,...`Cause the world needs more lawyers.
220,4774,MIA,220,Well it doesn't need more actresses.
221,4775,SEBASTIAN,221,You're not just an actress.
222,4776,MIA,222,"What do you mean, ""just an actress""?"
223,4777,SEBASTIAN,223,"You said it yourself, you're a child-
prodigy playwright."
224,4778,MIA,224,That is not what I said.
225,4779,SEBASTIAN,225,"You're too modest to say it but it's
true. So you could write your own roles.
Write something that's as interesting as
you are."
226,4780,MIA,226,"Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine
for an open-mic night. It was horrible."
227,4781,SEBASTIAN,227,"All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong
could have played the marching-band
charts he was given. What did he do
instead? He made history."
228,4782,MIA,228,"Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make
history instead."
229,4783,MIA (CONT'D),229,"Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's
something I should tell you..."
230,4784,SEBASTIAN,230,Yeah?
231,4785,MIA,231,I hate jazz.
232,4786,SEBASTIAN,232,"What does that mean? ""I hate jazz""?"
233,4787,MIA,233,"It means when I listen to it I don't like
it."
234,4788,SEBASTIAN,234,"But it's such a blanket statement. It's
like saying ""I hate animals""."
235,4789,MIA,235,I do hate some animals.
236,4790,SEBASTIAN,236,Do you need to be anywhere right now?
237,4791,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),237,"Most people say they hate jazz because
they don't have context. They don't get
where it came from. All these people
packed into flophouses in New Orleans,
speaking five different languages, and
jazz was how they talked to each other."
238,4792,MIA,238,I thought it was just Kenny G.
239,4793,SEBASTIAN,239,...What?
240,4794,MIA,240,"I associate it with facials. It's
relaxing."
241,4795,SEBASTIAN,241,"It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a
gunfight `cause somebody told him he
played a wrong note!"
242,4796,MIA,242,"Right, but it's good to talk over. Where
I grew up there's this jazz station
they'd play at cocktail parties whenever
they served the salami and cheese."
243,4797,SEBASTIAN,243,Mia. These are things you can't unsay.
244,4798,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),244,"It's not cocktail music -- it's a high-
wire act. These guys are performing and
composing and rearranging all at once."
245,4799,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),245,"That's why you need to be in the space
and see what's at stake. This whole thing
-- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll
head off to cut commercial sessions or do
pit at the Pantages `cause they have to --
but when I have my own place -- my club --
they'll play whatever they want."
246,4800,MIA,246,Your club?
247,4801,SEBASTIAN,247,"...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm
getting the lease back. It'll be perfect."
248,4802,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),248,"The world tells everyone to move on. Says
the music's had its moment. But I love it
too much. I'm not moving on."
249,4803,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),249,So?
250,4804,MIA,250,"Hi, I just missed a call..."
251,4805,MIA (CONT'D),251,I got a call-back!
252,4806,SEBASTIAN,252,Really? For what?
253,4807,MIA,253,That show I told you about.
254,4808,SEBASTIAN,254,Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?
255,4809,MIA,255,"Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel
Without a Cause."
256,4810,SEBASTIAN,256,"That's amazing! ""I got the bulletsssss!"""
257,4811,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),257,"You've seen it, right?"
258,4812,MIA,258,Obviously.
259,4813,MIA,259,No.
260,4814,SEBASTIAN,260,What? You're the movie person.
261,4815,MIA,261,It's the one I lie about.
262,4816,SEBASTIAN,262,"Come on. You can't do this audition and
never see Rebel. The theater near me's
playing it. If you want -- I can take
you. For research."
263,4817,MIA,263,...Ok.
264,4818,SEBASTIAN,264,10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?
265,4819,MIA,265,Ok.
266,4820,MIA,266,For research.
267,4821,MIA (CONT'D),267,"Hi, Mom!"
268,4822,MIA'S MOM (O.S.),268,"Hi, sweetie. How are you?"
269,4823,MIA,269,"Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot."
270,4824,MIA'S MOM (O.S.),270,Oh my God! You're going to be on TV??
271,4825,MIA,271,Well -- it's not picked up yet.
272,4826,MIA'S MOM (O.S.),272,Not picked up?
273,4827,MIA,273,"First they make the pilot, then if they
like the pilot it goes on TV."
274,4828,MIA'S MOM (O.S.),274,And you're in the pilot?
275,4829,MIA,275,"Well, no, I have a call-back."
276,4830,MIA'S MOM (O.S.),276,"I see... Didn't you audition for a TV
thing last week?"
277,4831,MIA,277,It's another audition.
278,4832,MIA'S MOM (O.S.),278,"I see... So you might get a role in a
thing that might one day be put on TV..."
279,4833,MIA,279,"...Well when you put it like that it
sounds like a huge accomplishment."
280,4834,MIA'S MOM (O.S.),280,"No, I don't mean that, it's so exciting.
What channel? ABC? HBO?"
281,4835,MIA,281,Oxygen.
282,4836,MIA'S MOM (O.S.),282,Oxygen?
283,4837,MIA,283,"You know what, I have to go. I love you."
284,4838,DIRECTOR (O.S.),284,...We'll be seeing you very soon.
285,4839,ASSISTANT,285,Mia Dolan?
286,4840,DIRECTOR,286,Whenever you're ready.
287,4841,MIA,287,"Two options. Follow my rules, or follow
my rules. Kapish? You want to bully,
you'd best be ready to get bullied --"
288,4842,DIRECTOR,288,Thanks.
289,4843,MIA,289,I can do it another way --
290,4844,DIRECTOR,290,"No, thanks, that was great."
291,4845,MIA'S MOM (O.S.),291,"Dad just helped me find Oxygen on the
guide! So exciting! So will you be
getting health insurance now?"
292,4846,ALEXIS,292,Mia?
293,4847,ALEXIS (CONT'D),293,Greg's here...
294,4848,GREG,294,"Hey... I'm parked out front. But we
should hurry, my brother just landed."
295,4849,GREG (CONT'D),295,Did you forget?
296,4850,MIA,296,Shit. No. Yes. I'll change...
297,4851,GREG,297,It's ok.
298,4852,GREG (O.S.) (CONT'D),298,"Josh! Yep, just picking Mia up now. Will
be there in twenty."
299,4853,JOSH,299,"That's right -- but now we've got a
surround-sound set-up, so it's like --"
300,4854,FIANCEE,300,It's like being in a movie theater.
301,4855,JOSH,301,"It's better than going to a theater,
really. You know theaters these days --"
302,4856,GREG,302,"Oh, sure --"
303,4857,JOSH,303,"-- they're so dirty, and they're either
too hot or too cold, and there's always
people talking, which is just --"
304,4858,JOSH,304,"-- just so annoying, I mean you're trying
to watch a movie -- one second --"
305,4859,JOSH,305,Hello?...
306,4860,FIANCEE,306,Probably work.
307,4861,JOSH,307,"Yeah, I'll have to call you back."
308,4862,JOSH,308,"So, yeah, we love it."
309,4863,JOSH (CONT'D),309,One word for you. Nicaragua.
310,4864,GREG,310,"I've never heard anyone say that. Was it
amazing?"
311,4865,JOSH,311,"Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort.
It was unbelievable."
312,4866,GREG,312,Mia?
313,4867,MIA,313,I'm sorry.
314,4868,MIA (CONT'D),314,I have an idea.
315,4869,MIA (CONT'D),315,What's that?
316,4870,TRACY (CONT'D),316,Is that a script?
317,4871,MIA,317,It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself.
318,4872,MIA,318,A play? You better give us roles!
319,4873,MIA,319,"Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman
show..."
320,4874,TRACY,320,...Is that gonna happen every time?
321,4875,MIA,321,I think so.
322,4876,MIA,322,It's one-way!!
323,4877,MIA,323,Sebastian?
324,4878,SEBASTIAN,324,Keith?
325,4879,MIA,325,Nice meeting you.
326,4880,SEBASTIAN,326,It's beautiful.
327,4881,MIA,327,...You're just saying that.
328,4882,SEBASTIAN,328,No... I'm not.
329,4883,MIA,329,"I don't know... Is the whole thing too
nostalgic?"
330,4884,SEBASTIAN,330,That's the point.
331,4885,MIA,331,But do you think people will like it?
332,4886,SEBASTIAN,332,Fuck `em.
333,4887,MIA,333,You always say that.
334,4888,SEBASTIAN,334,I truly believe it.
335,4889,MIA,335,"Fine -- as long as you sit front-row
`cause I'll probably throw up on the
middle of the stage otherwise."
336,4890,SEBASTIAN,336,I'll be front-row.
337,4891,"Revision                       43.
MIA",337,I made something for you.
338,4892,SEBASTIAN,338,What's that?
339,4893,MIA,339,It could be the name design. On the door.
340,4894,SEBASTIAN,340,"Why does it say ""Seb's""?"
341,4895,MIA,341,That's what you should name it.
342,4896,SEBASTIAN,342,Never.
343,4897,MIA,343,"Sebastian, no one's going to a club called
""Chicken on a Stick""."
344,4898,SEBASTIAN,344,"You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name
""Bird"" because he loved chicken. So my club's
gonna be old-school jazz and beer and
chicken. ""Chicken on a Stick""."
345,4899,MIA,345,No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz.
346,4900,MIA,346,"And it's time to start looking for other
places."
347,4901,SEBASTIAN,347,"It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them
samba all over its history."
348,4902,MIA,348,Make your own history.
349,4903,SEBASTIAN,349,Your play's incredible.
350,4904,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),350,"The whole world from your bedroom? Who's
doing that?"
351,4905,MIA,351,I'm doing that.
352,4906,MIA (CONT'D),352,So who was that guy at the Lighthouse?
353,4907,SEBASTIAN,353,...Which guy?
354,4908,MIA,354,The one who offered you a gig.
355,4909,SEBASTIAN,355,You mean Keith? He's the worst.
356,4910,MIA,356,Why was it weird between you two?
357,4911,SEBASTIAN,357,It's always weird with him.
358,4912,MIA,358,He did offer you a job.
359,4913,SEBASTIAN,359,Right...
360,4914,MIA,360,Are you going to call him?
361,4915,SEBASTIAN,361,No.
362,4916,MIA,362,Ok...
363,4917,SEBASTIAN,363,"Here's what we know. It's definitely
Chicken on a Stick --"
364,4918,SEBASTIAN,364,"-- and your play is going to be a
triumph."
365,4919,MIA (O.S.),365,"...No, Mom, it's a one-woman show... No,
I'm acting in it as well... No, I'm not
getting paid, I'm paying to do it..."
366,4920,MIA (O.S.),366,"He's great... He's going to open his own
jazz club. It's going to be incredible..."
367,4921,MIA (O.S.),367,"Well he has to get the money together
first, and... He's figuring it out...
Yeah, it's just been a little tricky
lately..."
368,4922,MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D),368,"Look -- he's going to find a way to open
it and you're going to love it. Ok? How's
Dad?"
369,4923,MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D),369,Sebastian.
370,4924,KEITH (CONT'D),370,Didn't know if I'd see you today.
371,4925,SEBASTIAN,371,Well... Here I am.
372,4926,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),372,Where's the piano?
373,4927,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),373,"Here's the deal. We've got distribution
with Universal, got our own imprint.
We're about to go on the road. We can cut
you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus
an equal share of any merchandise or
ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good?"
374,4928,KEITH (CONT'D),374,Sebastian?
375,4929,SEBASTIAN,375,"Yeah, that...that..."
376,4930,SEBASTIAN,376,...sounds good.
377,4931,SEBASTIAN,377,"Let's play, see how it feels."
378,4932,KEITH (CONT'D),378,I know. It's different.
379,4933,KEITH (CONT'D),379,"But you say you want to save jazz. How
are you going to save jazz if no one's
listening? Jazz wouldn't exist if people
hadn't gotten tired of what they were
listening to before."
380,4934,KEITH (CONT'D),380,"I mean, do you really think a bunch of
ninety-year-olds in a basement is the
future of the form? Traditionalists whined
when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs.
If traditionalists had their way, we'd
still be playing Dixieland."
381,4935,SEBASTIAN,381,"You're holding onto the past. But jazz is
about the future."
382,4936,KEITH,382,"I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't
as good as you. But you're a pain in the
ass, man."
383,4937,KEITH (CONT'D),383,"If it's not your thing, just let me know.
I don't want you uncomfortable and trying
to change this into something it's not.
But if you want it -- the job's yours."
384,4938,KEITH (CONT'D),384,SEBASTIAN                        MIA
385,4939,KEITH (CONT'D),385,Look at him -- watch --
386,4940,KEITH (CONT'D),386,"Now he's going to check the other window.
Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check
again. Yep, still closed."
387,4941,KEITH (CONT'D),387,"Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two
want anything?"
388,4942,MIA,388,"Thanks Harry, I'm good."
389,4943,Revision                       52.,389,"Same here but I think someone's trying to
break into your car."
390,4944,Revision                       52.,390,Don't stress about the play. Where's Seb now?
391,4945,MIA,391,I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure...
392,4946,MIA,392,"You should come over tonight. Harry's
cooking, but don't let that stop you."
393,4947,MIA,393,What's the matter?
394,4948,MIA,394,Nothing...
395,4949,MIA,395,You miss him.
396,4950,MIA,396,I guess. I'm adapting.
397,4951,MIA,397,"I got used to being alone. Growing up it
was just me and Seb. We only had each other."
398,4952,MIA,398,He told me.
399,4953,MIA,399,"I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met
Harry and -- we just fit..."
400,4954,MIA,400,You've changed Seb. You know that?
401,4955,MIA,401,Do you think he's happy?
402,4956,MIA,402,Is he happy?
403,4957,MIA,403,"I mean with the band, the travel, all of it."
404,4958,LAURA,404,"Our dad never got to do what he wanted.
We were always treading water, he took a
job running a washer-dryer store. But
every night at home he'd play his
clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record."
405,4959,LAURA,405,"So I look at Sebastian... Playing music,
getting paid for it. I'm happy for him."
406,4960,LAURA (CONT'D),406,Dreams change.
407,4961,LAURA (CONT'D),407,Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon.
408,4962,LAURA (CONT'D),408,I told you not to get me anything!
409,4963,HARRY,409,"Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess."
410,4964,LAURA,410,No -- I changed my mind.
411,4965,MIA,411,"Hey it's me... Not sure where you are --
maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I
haven't heard from you in a while... I
miss you..."
412,4966,MIA,412,Ok... Bye...
413,4967,SEBASTIAN,413,Surprise.
414,4968,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),414,And...
415,4969,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),415,"There's twenty-five pounds of apples in
it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem
but it tastes good."
416,4970,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),416,"I have to head back in the morning but I
needed to see you."
417,4971,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),417,Feels so good to be home.
418,4972,MIA,418,Stay.
419,4973,SEBASTIAN,419,How's the play going?
420,4974,MIA,420,I'm nervous.
421,4975,SEBASTIAN,421,Why?
422,4976,MIA,422,Because...
423,4977,MIA,423,What if people show up?
424,4978,SEBASTIAN,424,Fuck `em!
425,4979,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),425,You're nervous about what they think?
426,4980,MIA,426,"I'm nervous to be up on a stage and
perform in front of people. I'm
terrified."
427,4981,SEBASTIAN,427,They should be so lucky to see it.
428,4982,SEBASTIAN,428,"It's going to be incredible. I can't
wait."
429,4983,MIA,429,I can.
430,4984,MIA (CONT'D),430,What time do you leave in the morning?
431,4985,SEBASTIAN,431,6:45.
432,4986,MIA,432,Ugh.
433,4987,SEBASTIAN,433,Yep. Boise.
434,4988,MIA,434,Boise?
435,4989,SEBASTIAN,435,You should come.
436,4990,MIA,436,To Boise?
437,4991,SEBASTIAN,437,"Yeah, you could knock that off your
bucket list."
438,4992,MIA,438,Wish I could.
439,4993,SEBASTIAN,439,Why can't you?
440,4994,MIA,440,Come to Boise?
441,4995,SEBASTIAN,441,Yeah.
442,4996,MIA,442,Because I have to rehearse.
443,4997,SEBASTIAN,443,Can't you rehearse anywhere?
444,4998,MIA,444,You mean anywhere you are?
445,4999,SEBASTIAN,445,...I -- I guess...
446,5000,MIA,446,"Well, all my stuff is here and my show's
in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it
doesn't seem practical..."
447,5001,SEBASTIAN,447,"Right... I just -- we're going to have to
do things so we can see each other. We
never see each other."
448,5002,MIA,448,"I know, but when are you done?"
449,5003,SEBASTIAN,449,...What do you mean?
450,5004,MIA,450,When are you done with the tour?
451,5005,"Revision                   57.
SEBASTIAN",451,"But -- as soon as we're done with the
tour we go back and record, and then we
go back on tour."
452,5006,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),452,"We tour so we can make the record, and
then we go back on tour to sell the
record."
453,5007,MIA,453,So it's...the long haul?
454,5008,SEBASTIAN,454,...What does that mean?
455,5009,MIA,455,"I mean the long haul -- like, you're
going to be in this band for a long time."
456,5010,SEBASTIAN,456,What did you think I was going to do?
457,5011,MIA,457,"I don't know, I didn't think the band
would --"
458,5012,SEBASTIAN,458,You didn't think we'd be successful.
459,5013,MIA,459,"No, that's not what I meant. What I meant
was -- this band -- you're going to be on
the road for -- what, years now?"
460,5014,SEBASTIAN,460,"Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road
for years with just this record."
461,5015,MIA,461,Do you like the music you're playing?
462,5016,SEBASTIAN,462,I don't know how that matters.
463,5017,MIA,463,"It matters if you're going to give up
your dream to be on the road for years.
Revision                    58."
464,5018,MIA,464,"I do like jazz now, because of you."
465,5019,SEBASTIAN,465,"What am I supposed to do? Go back to
playing ""Jingle Bells"" so I can save
money for some Shangri-La club no one
wants to go to?"
466,5020,MIA,466,"People will want to go to it! People love
what other people are passionate about."
467,5021,SEBASTIAN,467,Not in my experience.
468,5022,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),468,"Anyway -- it's time to grow up. You know?
This is what I'm doing. If you had a
problem, I wish you would've said
something earlier, before I signed on the
dotted line."
469,5023,MIA,469,"You had a dream that you were sticking
to, that --"
470,5024,SEBASTIAN,470,This is the dream!
471,5025,MIA,471,This is not your dream.
472,5026,SEBASTIAN,472,"Guys like me go their whole lives and
never do anything that's liked. I'm
finally doing something that people
enjoy. What is wrong with that?"
473,5027,MIA,473,Why do you care so much about being liked
474,5028,SEBASTIAN,474,"You're an actress, who are you to talk??"
475,5029,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),475,"Maybe you liked me more when I was a
failure because it made you feel better
about yourself."
476,5030,MIA,476,Are you kidding?
477,5031,SEBASTIAN,477,No.
478,5032,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),478,Wait --
479,5033,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),479,SEBASTIAN                          COLE
480,5034,KEITH (CONT'D),480,"Put a light on the drums... I need more
fill in this corner..."
481,5035,KEITH (CONT'D),481,"Bass, head up. Piano, look down at the
keys."
482,5036,KEITH (CONT'D),482,"Cut the music. Turn the keyboard live.
Piano look up, play."
483,5037,KEITH (CONT'D),483,No -- piano -- actually play something.
484,5038,KEITH (CONT'D),484,"Good, now bite your lip like you're
concentrating on a solo."
485,5039,KEITH (CONT'D),485,That was good. Don't stop.
486,5040,KEITH (CONT'D),486,"I swear to God, if I have to hear one
more hipster waxing nostalgic I'm gonna
slit my wrists."
487,5041,KEITH (CONT'D),487,Seriously.
488,5042,KEITH (CONT'D),488,"She's not even good. That window
thing...?"
489,5043,KEITH (CONT'D),489,Christ... Don't quit your day job...
490,5044,SEBASTIAN,490,Mia!
491,5045,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),491,I'm sorry --
492,5046,MIA,492,Stop --
493,5047,SEBASTIAN,493,"I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm
sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise
I'll make it up to you --"
494,5048,MIA,494,It's over.
495,5049,SEBASTIAN,495,...What do you mean?
496,5050,MIA,496,I'm done embarrassing myself.
497,5051,SEBASTIAN,497,You didn't embarrass yourself...
498,5052,LAURA,498,You remember the McKenzies?
499,5053,SEBASTIAN,499,"Oh God, I didn't see them."
500,5054,LAURA,500,"Yeah. They kept going, ""oh Sebastian's so
handsome""."
501,5055,SEBASTIAN,501,You look beautiful.
502,5056,SEBASTIAN,502,I hope it was ok. I haven't played in a while.
503,5057,LAURA,503,You were great
504,5058,LAURA,504,You're always great when you play.
505,5059,LAURA (CONT'D),505,"Now -- listen to me. I want you to save
for a down payment. You understand? You
need a home."
506,5060,SEBASTIAN,506,Yes ma'am.
507,5061,LAURA,507,I'm not gonna be hovering anymore.
508,5062,SEBASTIAN,508,...You still think New York?
509,5063,LAURA,509,"I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know,
it's exciting..."
510,5064,LAURA (CONT'D),510,Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws...
511,5065,LAURA (CONT'D),511,Is my...my hair...?
512,5066,SEBASTIAN,512,What...?
513,5067,SEBASTIAN,513,"Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan."
514,5068,SEBASTIAN,514,Wrong number.
515,5069,SEBASTIAN,515,"-- She's not answering her cell and I was
told I might find her here."
516,5070,SEBASTIAN,516,"Yeah, well...not anymore."
517,5071,SEBASTIAN,517,Ok. If you do talk to her --
518,5072,SEBASTIAN,518,I won't.
519,5073,SEBASTIAN,519,"-- please tell her Jane at Amy Brandt
Casting is trying to reach her."
520,5074,SEBASTIAN,520,"""Casting""...?"
521,5075,SEBASTIAN,521,MIA'S MOM                            MIA
522,5076,MIA,522,What the hell...?
523,5077,MIA,523,Why did you come here?
524,5078,SEBASTIAN,524,Because I have good news.
525,5079,MIA,525,Ok...
526,5080,SEBASTIAN,526,Amy Brandt. The casting director.
527,5081,MIA,527,I know who she is.
528,5082,SEBASTIAN,528,"She was at your play. And she loved it.
And she loved it so much that she wants
you to come audition for a huge movie
she's got."
529,5083,MIA,529,I'm not going.
530,5084,SEBASTIAN,530,...Excuse me?
531,5085,MIA,531,I'm -- no... That will kill me.
532,5086,SEBASTIAN,532,That's it?
533,5087,MIA,533,Yes.
534,5088,"Revision                    70.
SEBASTIAN",534,So you're happy here?
535,5089,MIA,535,I'm happier.
536,5090,SEBASTIAN,536,Why won't you come?
537,5091,MIA,537,I told you.
538,5092,SEBASTIAN,538,I don't buy it.
539,5093,MIA,539,Because it's another audition!
540,5094,MIA,540,"I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do
you want to know what happens? Either
they interrupt me because someone ordered
a sandwich, or they cut me off after two
seconds, or I'm crying and they start
laughing, or I'm one of a hundred
lookalikes in the waiting room who never
has a chance, because --"
541,5095,MIA,541,-- because --
542,5096,SEBASTIAN,542,Because what?
543,5097,MIA,543,Because I'm probably not good enough.
544,5098,SEBASTIAN,544,Yes you are.
545,5099,MIA,545,No. Maybe I'm not.
546,5100,MIA (CONT'D),546,"Maybe I'm one of those people who's
always wanted to do it but never had a
chance. It's a pipe dream. Maybe it's
like you said. Maybe I need to grow up."
547,5101,MIA (CONT'D),547,"I can go back to school. I can find
something else that I'm supposed to do. I
left school to give it a shot, and it
didn't work out, and it took six years,
and I don't want to do it anymore."
548,5102,SEBASTIAN,548,Why?
549,5103,MIA,549,Why what?
550,5104,SEBASTIAN,550,Why don't you want to do it anymore?
551,5105,MIA,551,"...Because it hurts a little bit too
much."
552,5106,SEBASTIAN,552,"I told them you'd be there at five-thirty
tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I
drive back at eight. Either you'll be
outside or you won't."
553,5107,MIA,553,How did you find me?
554,5108,SEBASTIAN,554,The house across from the library.
555,5109,SEBASTIAN,555,Mia?
556,5110,SEBASTIAN,556,"I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you."
557,5111,SEBASTIAN,557,The movie shoots in Paris. There's no script.
558,5112,SEBASTIAN,558,When do you find out?
559,5113,MIA,559,"They said the next couple of days... But
I'm not expecting to find anything out."
560,5114,SEBASTIAN,560,You're going to get it.
561,5115,MIA,561,"No, I'm not."
562,5116,SEBASTIAN,562,You are. I know these things.
563,5117,MIA,563,Where are we?
564,5118,SEBASTIAN,564,Griffith Park.
565,5119,MIA,565,I mean -- where are we?
566,5120,SEBASTIAN,566,I know...
567,5121,SEBASTIAN,567,I don't know.
568,5122,MIA,568,What do we do?
569,5123,SEBASTIAN,569,"I don't think we can do anything. Because
when you get this --"
570,5124,MIA,570,If I get this --
571,5125,SEBASTIAN,571,"When you get this -- you've got to give
it everything you've got."
572,5126,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),572,It's your dream.
573,5127,MIA,573,What are you going to do?
574,5128,SEBASTIAN,574,"I've got to follow my own plan. Stay
here. Get my own thing going. You know..."
575,5129,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),575,"You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz
there. And you love jazz now."
576,5130,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),576,Right?
577,5131,MIA,577,Right.
578,5132,SEBASTIAN,578,"I guess we're just going to have to wait
and see."
579,5133,MIA,579,You know I'm always going to love you.
580,5134,SEBASTIAN,580,I'm always going to love you too.
581,5135,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),581,Look at this view.
582,5136,MIA,582,I've seen better.
583,5137,SEBASTIAN,583,Agreed.
584,5138,MIA,584,I've never been here during the day.
585,5139,MIA,585,"Hi... Iced coffee, please."
586,5140,MIA,586,On us.
587,5141,MIA,587,"No, no, that's fine."
588,5142,SEBASTIAN,588,"Alright, I'm done."
589,5143,SEBASTIAN,589,Harris did a nice job with it.
590,5144,SEBASTIAN,590,Took him long enough.
591,5145,SEBASTIAN,591,"No one touches the instruments. Carson's
coming an hour early to test levels."
592,5146,SEBASTIAN,592,I got a check for you to sign.
593,5147,SEBASTIAN,593,How'd we do last month?
594,5148,SEBASTIAN,594,Not too bad.
595,5149,SEBASTIAN,595,Not too bad is great.
596,5150,SEBASTIAN,596,See you tonight.
597,5151,SEBASTIAN,597,See you tonight.
598,5152,SEBASTIAN,598,King Seb!
599,5153,SEBASTIAN,599,Hothouse Eddie -- miss me?
600,5154,SEBASTIAN,600,Like the desert misses the rain.
601,5155,SEBASTIAN,601,Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight.
602,5156,SEBASTIAN,602,"Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh?"
603,5157,SEBASTIAN,603,That's not Edgar.
604,5158,MIA,604,"Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea."
605,5159,MIA,605,"Bye, Mrs. Dolan."
606,5160,MIA,606,"What if we miss this? What do we tell
Natalie?"
607,5161,MIA,607,We can just see it back in New York...
608,5162,MIA (CONT'D),608,"Do you want to just skip it...? Turn off
here and get dinner?"
609,5163,MIA (CONT'D),609,Alright...
610,5164,MIA (CONT'D),610,This looks fun.
611,5165,MIA (CONT'D),611,Come on...
612,5166,MIA (CONT'D),612,Mia?
613,5167,SEBASTIAN,613,"Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen."
614,5168,SEBASTIAN,614,"I don't know, I told him to play ""Jingle
Bells""."
615,5169,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D),615,Welcome to Seb's.
616,5170,MIA,616,"I just wanted to say -- I saw your
playing, and I --"
617,5171,MIA,617,Do you want to stay for another?
618,5172,MIA,618,No... We should go.
