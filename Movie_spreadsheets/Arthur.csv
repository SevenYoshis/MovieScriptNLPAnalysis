1,ARTHUR,1,"Evening, Constable!"
2,OLDER COP 1,2,"(seen it all before)
Hi, Arthur."
3,ARTHUR,3,"Are you familiar with the
expression `I can explain
everything'?"
4,OLDER COP 1,4,"Out of the car, please.
2."
5,ARTHUR,5,"Terribly sorry, but in the film
they used a different model to show
the old Batchap getting in and out.
This one has no doors, so I'd have
to squeeze out the back arsehole
first. Which nobody wants..."
6,(TO COP 2),6,"Apart from you, cheeky monkey!"
7,(BEAT),7,"It's a joke! Okay, okay."
8,OLDER COP 1,8,"Okay, explain everything."
9,ARTHUR,9,"Well. What with having spunked 1.6
million fat Alberts on this little
runaround, I thought why not take
it a step further and try to
actually collar a few ne-er do
wells? It worked for the
billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not
the future billionaire Arthur Bach-
Templemead? Will I have to do
traffic school?"
10,OLDER COP 2,10,"How much have you drunk, Arthur?"
11,ARTHUR,11,"To use the technical medical term -
megabloodyshitloads. Either that or
I've had a stroke! But fret not, I
have a designated driver."
12,HOMELESS ROBIN,12,Where's my five thousand dollars?
13,ARTHUR,13,"The Boy Homeless here neglected to
say he'd never driven."
14,(MORE),14,3.
15,ARTHUR (CONT'D),15,"Or that the only reason he's sober
is to be ready for the conspiracy
of leopards about to seize
Manhattan."
16,HOMELESS ROBIN,16,It's LIZARDS! English prick!
17,ARTHUR,17,"I trust this will cover all repairs
to New York and any inconvenience
to your good selves?"
18,ARTHUR (CONT'D),18,"Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the
other chap."
19,JAY,19,Then the crazy motherfucker cut me!
20,ARTHUR,20,Goodness. Why?
21,JAY,21,"Said I cut the bombita with pig
killer!"
22,ARTHUR,22,"Rude man. And who threw hot
Americano in whose face again?"
23,JAY,23,"I did in his. No half and half
neither. That shit burnt!"
24,JAY,24,4.
25,GARY,25,I burnt my sister's hair.
26,JAY,26,"(high fiving him)
Cool..."
27,GARY,27,"Ho wanted to evict me, just 'cause
I don't fit her definition of
hygiene. Plenty of places to take a
shit, toilet's just one of them.
Just ask the a-rabs."
28,ARTHUR,28,"It's like a chat show, this.
(looking into an imaginary"
29,CAMERA),29,"It's been said of my next guest, by
Jay the bandaged lunatic, that
she's `a sick-ass, whacked-out,
whacked-up asswipe'.
(to a PROSTITUTE)
Carmella, when did you first dream
of becoming a crack whore?"
30,PROSTITUTE,30,Mother died when I was six.
31,ARTHUR,31,"Oh G-d, I hate when that happens."
32,PROSTITUTE,32,"My father raped me when I was
twelve."
33,ARTHUR,33,"Sounds like you had six relatively
good years."
34,JAY,34,What do you do?
35,ARTHUR,35,"I model riding boots, I spend
money, I sleep with women. But I
have weekends off and I am my own
boss."
36,OLDER COP 1,36,"Hey, The Drunk Knight. Your Fairy G-
d-lawyer's here.
5."
37,"ARTHUR
(STANDING)",37,"I never thought New York's
underbelly could be quite such
agreeable company. I shall never
forget you. Farewell."
38,DEVERE,38,"I don't think your mother will be
pleased, Arthur."
39,ARTHUR,39,"Really, Elverton - if a chap can't
help out a few chums, whatever
their station in life."
40,ARTHUR (CONT'D),40,"Each has given his or her word to
put the criminal life behind them."
41,ARTHUR,41,"I am the Batman. Gotham can sleep
easy tonight."
42,JAY,42,"(points at A CAMERAMAN)
Don't point that shit at me, bitch!
I will FUCK YOU UP!"
43,HOMELESS ROBIN,43,Yes! Yes! Kill the lizards!
44,PRESS,44,"Arthur! What will your mother say?
Didn't she send you here to get you
out of the British papers? Arthur!
6."
45,ARTHUR,45,"Anyone need a job? My last driver
resigned after I filled his limo
with squirrels. Preferably sober,
clean driving licence?"
46,ARTHUR,46,"ARTHUR (O.S.)
Anyone know a good bar?"
47,ARTHUR,47,JUMP CUT TO:
48,ARTHUR,48,Stand back!
49,ARTHUR,49,7.
50,"CARMELLA
(LAUGHING)",50,"Oh, man. Nobody tell you about the
recession?"
51,ARTHUR,51,The what?
52,ARTHUR,52,"Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix
this thing right now.
(to his first customer)
How much, sir?"
53,FIRST MAN,53,Um. $800 please.
54,ARTHUR,54,"Coming right up.
(keys it in)
Fries with that?"
55,ARTHUR (CONT'D),55,"Congratulations everyone! THE
RECESSION'S OVER!"
56,ARTHUR (CONT'D),56,"Pierre? Arthur Bach-Templemead. Can
you squeeze me in for a little
snack? Yeah, just me and a couple
of mates."
57,ARTHUR (CONT'D),57,8.
58,ARTHUR,58,"Pierre! We'd like 182 pate de foie
gras, 182 chateaubriand steaks, a
motherlode of chips and your entire
wine cellar please."
59,ERICA,59,Arthur?
60,"ARTHUR
(TAKEN ABACK)",60,"Erica? Fancy meeting you here!
Er...Everybody, this is Erica - the
very best friend forever of my
girlfriend Susan. And Erica's
parents Ernest and Margaret.
(to Erica and her parents)
Are you familiar with the
expression `I can't explain
anything'?"
61,ERICA,61,"Who are the women with you, Arthur?"
62,ARTHUR,62,"Oh, um, this is Sofia. I believe
she works for Avis. Checks the cars
for dings, dead people in the
trunk, that sort of thing. And
this is Carmella. Anyway..."
63,ERICA'S FATHER,63,"What do you do, Carmella?"
64,CARMELLA,64,"Whatever you want. But no
penetration without a rubber."
65,ARTHUR,65,"Carmella's joking. She's actually
a...queen. Of a very small country."
66,ERICA'S FATHER,66,Is she now?
67,ARTHUR,67,"It's terribly small.
9."
68,ERICA'S FATHER,68,I see.
69,ARTHUR,69,"Rhode Island could beat the crap
out of it in a war."
70,ERICA'S FATHER,70,"Yes, it's a small place."
71,ARTHUR,71,"85 cents in a cab from one end of
the country to the other. I'm
talking small."
72,ERICA'S FATHER,72,"I think I understand how small it
is."
73,ARTHUR,73,"Just had the entire country
carpeted, this is not a big place."
74,ERICA'S FATHER,74,"You need to grow up, Arthur."
75,ARTHUR,75,"That's easy for you to say, you
haven't got 50 pairs of short
trousers hanging in your closet.
Maybe we should go somewhere else."
76,ERICA,76,Maybe you should.
77,ARTHUR,77,"Could I have all those lobsters to
go, please?"
78,ARTHUR,78,10.
79,ARTHUR,79,GIRL (O.S.)
80,(PANTING),80,More British!
81,ARTHUR,81,"Cup of tea? Nice hot cup of hot
Rosy Lee right up your fanny?"
82,ARTHUR,82,11.
83,ARTHUR,83,"Hugh Grant Mr Bean self deprecation
mad cow disease Yorkshire pudding
bad teeth rain rain rain rain!"
84,ARTHUR,84,"(brightly, as he humps)
Morning, Hobson!"
85,HOBSON,85,"Morning, Arthur."
86,HOBSON (CONT'D),86,"I'm afraid your impromptu stimulus
package failed to reignite the
economy.
(reading a receipt)
De Cache Cocktail Lounge: $23,897?"
87,ARTHUR,87,Umm...Celebration of Kwanzaa.
88,HOBSON,88,"The African heritage festival
celebrated five months from now?"
89,HOBSON,89,12.
90,ARTHUR,90,"(noticing Sofia's stopped
having sex with him)
Why are you stopping? Oh, sorry.
How impolite of me. Sofia, this is
Hobson, my nanny."
91,SOFIA,91,Nanny?
92,HOBSON,92,He's merely shaped like an adult.
93,SOFIA,93,Is she going to stay here?
94,ARTHUR,94,"Hobson, could you come back in a
minute and a half please?"
95,HOBSON,95,"Negative. You're seeing your mother
this morning."
96,ARTHUR,96,Nobody told me.
97,HOBSON,97,"Actually I did, on the other side
of the vast moat of champagne known
as `last night'."
98,HOBSON (CONT'D),98,"I wouldn't recommend letting him
get used to your breasts, dear.
Addictive personality. He was at
mine until he was six."
99,ARTHUR,99,Hobson! Really...
100,HOBSON,100,"I had to dab Tabasco sauce on the
nipples to see him off..."
101,SOFIA,101,I can't do this.
102,SOFIA,102,13.
103,HOBSON,103,"I support your decision 100%. Will
you be requiring a taxi, or just be
getting in a random passing car?"
104,HOBSON (CONT'D),104,"Say goodbye to your new friends,
Arthur. They have to go back to the
recession now."
105,ARTHUR,105,"Cancel my mother please, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today."
106,ARTHUR (CONT'D),106,"Not the death metal, please!"
107,HOBSON,107,"(shouting over the music)
Aren't you a fan of Carcass?"
108,HOBSON (CONT'D),108,"`Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a
classic of its genre."
109,ARTHUR,109,"OKAY, OKAY, I'LL GET UP!"
110,HOBSON,110,Good boy.
111,ARTHUR,111,I'm going for a shower.
112,HOBSON,112,"I'll alert the media.
14."
113,"ARTHUR
(SINGING)",113,"To Bombay, a travelling circus
came..."
114,HOBSON,114,"They brought an intelligent
elephant and Nellie was her
name...Hobson!"
115,ARTHUR,115,Female Tom Hanks!
116,ARTHUR,116,"ARTHUR (O.S.)
Heading east towards Park Avenue."
117,HOBSON,117,She's early today...
118,ARTHUR,118,"Can we invite her up and dress her
as Forrest Gump?"
119,HOBSON,119,No.
120,ARTHUR,120,Just for a laugh! We'll pay her.
121,HOBSON,121,Do your armpits.
122,"(INTO PHONE)
(MORE)",122,15.
123,HOBSON (CONT'D),123,"Mr. Miller? My employer
inexplicably agreed to purchase
your..."
124,(READS SCREEN),124,"`Authentic 1981 `Funshine' Care
Bear'? For $11,000 plus shipping
costs? Sorry, but that transaction
will take place over my dead body,
and I'm feeling rather well today."
125,(READS SCREEN),125,"ARTHUR (O.S.)
Hobson! That was your birthday
present! You like bears!"
126,ARTHUR (CONT'D),126,Father Wolverine...
127,ARTHUR (CONT'D),127,"Wank Williams...That man has the
constitution of an ox."
128,HOBSON,128,"That reminds me, clean your
genitals. Heaven knows what
wildlife that girl was harbouring
between her thighs."
129,ARTHUR,129,"I give you `Sideways farting
spider'."
130,HOBSON,130,"Arthur, you have to stop giving
money away!
16."
131,ARTHUR,131,I'm a philanthropist.
132,HOBSON,132,"With the emphasis on the `pissed'.
Really, what is it about unearned
wealth that brings out such idiocy
in those who have it and those who
want it? The way you're going,
you'll have spent your inheritance
before you've inherited it."
133,ARTHUR,133,"(shifts to new pose)
`Eagle pointing at lesbian.'"
134,HOBSON,134,Why did you fire Jessica?
135,ARTHUR,135,"What kind of yoga teacher won't let
a pupil invent positions? She was
a Nazi with a pan pipe C.D."
136,(CHANGING POSE),136,`Upwards Pooping Astronaut'.
137,HOBSON,137,"Interesting. It looks more like
`Rich twit hiding from mother.' May
I remind you, she finances your
preposterous existence..."
138,ARTHUR,138,"I know, I know. Never bite the hand
that fists me."
139,MARTY,139,"Sorry, fellas."
140,"HOBSON
(CONSPIRATORIAL)",140,"You don't seriously intend to keep
employing this gentleman?
17."
141,ARTHUR,141,"Give the guy a chance, Hobson. He
got laid off in Chicago..."
142,HOBSON,142,"But he doesn't know his way around
New York!"
143,ARTHUR,143,"So? I want interesting, fun people
around me, not drones who just get
the job done..."
144,ARTHUR (CONT'D),144,Marty! Stop the car!
145,ARTHUR (CONT'D),145,"WOMAN (O.S.)
The Chrysler Building. Designed by
William Van Allen..."
146,NAOMI,146,"...and inspired by the machine age
of the 1920s, this magnificent
structure was the world's tallest
building for 11 months before the
Empire State stole its thunder."
147,NAOMI (CONT'D),147,"The Chrysler got its name when the
builder went bust in the 1928
Cement Famine and had to melt down
his Chrysler to make the pointy bit
at the top. If you peer closely you
can still make out remnants of a
hub cap and a sticker reading `Honk
twice if you voted Hoover.'"
148,NAOMI (CONT'D),148,18.
149,NAOMI (CONT'D),149,"That was a joke, folks. It was
built for the Chrysler corporation."
150,NAOMI (CONT'D),150,"The spire is a beauty, especially
on a winter's morning when the sun
hits it and it just seems to...
GRUMPY FEMALE TOURIST"
151,(INTERRUPTING),151,How tall is it?
152,NAOMI,152,"1047 feet madam, not allowing for
pigeon shit. Okay, let's cross."
153,ARTHUR,153,Can I join your tour please?
154,NAOMI,154,"Sure. It's $15, plus $5 for the
free authentic street pretzel.
Sorry, my bosses make the prices."
155,NAOMI (CONT'D),155,Sorry. I can't take cards.
156,(BEAT),156,"Ah, owe me it. I start on that
corner every day on the hour..."
157,NAOMI (CONT'D),157,"Hey, you big blind jerk! Doesn't
your braille windshield work?"
158,"CABBIE
(ANGRY)",158,"!NO ME HINCHAN LAS PELOTAS!

159,NAOMI,159,"PEGUELO ENCIMA DE SU ASNO, USTED

MARTILLO!"
160,ARTHUR,160,Wow. What did you say?
161,NAOMI,161,"Just generalised criticism of his
parents and genitals.
(to the tourists)
Everyone make it over alive?
Excellent. Next we enter Times
Square, world famous for New Year's
Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball
descends at eye-poppingly slow
speed for the inexplicable
entertainment of a million drunk
fools. Many people think the square
is actually a square, despite
blatant evidence otherwise."
162,(TO ARTHUR),162,Sir? What shape is Times Square?
163,ARTHUR,163,A circle?
164,"NAOMI
(LAUGHS)",164,See? Morons.
165,"NAOMI
(LAUGHS)",165,"GRUMPY MALE TOURIST
When do we get the pretzel?"
166,NAOMI,166,"Soon, sir. Soon."
167,NAOMI (CONT'D),167,"Okay, next the very Laundromat once
used by George Gershwin, Donald
Trump...
20."
168,NAOMI,168,"...Mr Big from Sex and the City and
three of the 9-11 terrorists."
169,NAOMI (CONT'D),169,"Oh, dad."
170,NAOMI (CONT'D),170,"The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas drank
himself to death at the Chelsea
Hotel half an hour after losing a
sock in this very dryer."
171,"ARTHUR
(CONSPIRATORIAL)",171,"Are you abusing this tour to do
your errands?"
172,NAOMI,172,"Are you abusing the tour to stalk
me?"
173,ARTHUR,173,Absolutely.
174,ARTHUR (CONT'D),174,"These things are amazing. Have you
ever put all your father's clothes
on and just got inside one?"
175,HOBSON,175,"Where the blazes is that boy?
Arthur!
21."
176,NAOMI,176,"Ahead, the jewel in Manhattan's
crown, the Empire State Building.
This iconic symbol of American
corporate might was adapted during
World War 2 in case of attack from
enemy forces. At three minutes'
notice the entire structure can
retract into the ground like a
tortoise's head."
177,TOURIST,177,"That's not possible. I should know,
I'm a civil engineer."
178,NAOMI,178,You're not being very civil to me.
179,ARTHUR,179,"The building doesn't retract; the
ground rises up."
180,NAOMI,180,"Exactly. The ground rises up! Thank
you, sir."
181,ARTHUR,181,"They were going to install giant
legs so if a plane was flying at
the tower it could run away. But
where's it going to run?"
182,NAOMI,182,Manhattan's in the way.
183,ARTHUR,183,It'd have to jump in the Hudson.
184,NAOMI,184,"Victory to the Nazis. Is that what
you want?"
185,NAOMI (CONT'D),185,"Okay, folks, your pretzel awaits."
186,NAOMI (CONT'D),186,22.
187,NAOMI (CONT'D),187,Do I know you from somewhere?
188,ARTHUR,188,If you go on Perez Hilton or TMZ.
189,NAOMI,189,What are they?
190,ARTHUR,190,The gossip websites.
191,NAOMI,191,"That the internet? Ah, my
computer's too old for all that."
192,ARTHUR,192,For the internet? Seriously?
193,NAOMI,193,"Life's too short for all this
obsessive upgrading."
194,ARTHUR,194,"You consider the internet an
upgrade? Wow."
195,NAOMI,195,So why do people gossip about you?
196,ARTHUR,196,"Ah, that was a joke. I'm nobody."
197,HOBSON,197,You're late for your mother!
198,"NAOMI
(TO ARTHUR)",198,"Sorry, this pretzel stand is a
watering hole for the crazies.
(raises her voice to"
199,HOBSON),199,"The soup kitchen's just up and to
the left, honey."
200,ARTHUR,200,"Hobson, this is...
(reads her badge)
Naomi."
201,NAOMI,201,"She's with you?
23."
202,HOBSON,202,"Delighted to meet you, Naomi.
Normally one has to go to a bowling
alley to meet a woman of your
stature."
203,NAOMI,203,"Ooh, Grandma's got jokes."
204,HOBSON,204,"You aren't the first woman who
walks the streets this young man
has asked."
205,NAOMI,205,"Who's this? Joan Rivers' older
bitterer sister?"
206,ARTHUR,206,My nanny.
207,NAOMI,207,"Obviously. Seriously, who is she?"
208,ARTHUR,208,"My nanny. Well, she started as
that, but these days she's more of
an all-round enforcer and
bodyguard."
209,NAOMI,209,"Sorry, I have to get out the cattle
prod and haul ass. Got another tour
starting in eight minutes."
210,ARTHUR,210,Can I call you?
211,NAOMI,211,"I don't give my number to grown men
with nannies. But as you may not be
a grown man, it's 917 476 2030."
212,NAOMI,212,24.
213,ARTHUR,213,But what if this is the one?
214,HOBSON,214,"This is just like the Komodo
dragon. Everyone else is happy to
see one in the zoo and leave it
there. You had to own one. Thank
goodness that handbag manufacturer
was prepared to take the poor
lizard away."
215,"ARTHUR
(HORRIFIED)",215,You said he's in London Zoo!
216,HOBSON,216,"He is, Arthur. Are you the only one
allowed to joke now?"
217,ARTHUR,217,I don't like it here.
218,HOBSON,218,"Of course you don't. People work
here."
219,"GRANT
(HATES ARTHUR)",219,"Good afternoon, Mr Bach-Templemead."
220,ARTHUR,220,"Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your
parents are you most like?
Abercrombie or Fitch?"
221,GRANT,221,"(doesn't get the joke)
I have no connection with that
store. My family name is Von
Krausehoff. Take a seat please.
25."
222,GRANT (CONT'D),222,"Vivienne?
(conspiratorial, flirty)
White mid-rise briefs...mmmm."
223,HOBSON,223,"Don't fret, Arthur. This won't take
long. Then we'll have ice cream."
224,HOBSON,224,"VIVIENNE (O.S.)
Come in, Arthur."
225,VIVIENNE (CONT'D),225,Arthur.
226,ARTHUR,226,Vivienne.
227,VIVIENNE,227,You know I prefer `mother'.
228,ARTHUR,228,"I'm sorry. You look more like a
Vivienne."
229,VIVIENNE,229,"(not looking up)
So. How are you, Arthur?"
230,ARTHUR,230,"Quite busy. I have a riding boot
shoot for Petrie Dressage...
26."
231,ARTHUR (CONT'D),231,"What else...I'm meeting Ivanka
Trump for brunch to discuss the
environment. She's sending her
helicopter to avoid the traffic..."
232,ARTHUR (CONT'D),232,"Crashed my Batmobile into the
bronze bull on Wall Street..."
233,ARTHUR (CONT'D),233,"...which caused a hole to swallow
up the New York Stock Exchange..."
234,ARTHUR (CONT'D),234,"..the world economy to collapse and
the planet to descend into looting
and cannibalism."
235,ARTHUR (CONT'D),235,"What else? Um...tripped over in the
shower this morning. Head split
open, found a family of meerkats
hiding in there! Hated the thought
of the little lads being homeless
so I bricked up the remaining half
of my brain, popped them back in
and Hobson glued my skull back
together."
236,ARTHUR (CONT'D),236,"I'm thinking of buying a giant. I
think the market's right for it."
237,ARTHUR (CONT'D),237,You really are a shoddy mother.
238,ARTHUR (CONT'D),238,27.
239,VIVIENNE,239,"Did I hear you say you were meeting
Ivanka Trump for brunch? That's
nice. Right. Today we're going to
have a friendly chat. Then a
serious talk. And lastly make a
timetable. How does all that sound?"
240,ARTHUR,240,Amazing. Do you have any vodka?
241,VIVIENNE,241,"What happened, Arthur? You were
such a sweet baby."
242,ARTHUR,242,"I still wake up in my own poo
occasionally."
243,VIVIENNE,243,"Right, that's it for the chat. Time
to transition to our talk."
244,VIVIENNE (CONT'D),244,"This insanity has to end, Arthur.
As the delightful coffee-coloured
gentleman who runs this country
said, `The time has come to set
aside childish things.'"
245,ARTHUR,245,Can't Hobson set them aside for me?
246,VIVIENNE,246,"Susan is a splendid girl. Her feet
are on the ground, she's of fine
stock..."
247,"ARTHUR
(GETS UP)",247,"Oh. That's what this is all about.
I'm not marrying Susan. I don't
love her."
248,VIVIENNE,248,"And? You think I spent my marriage
to your father skipping through
meadows?
28."
249,VIVIENNE,249,29.
250,ARTHUR,250,(heading to the door)
251,VIVIENNE,251,30.
252,ARTHUR,252,"That I won't follow in his
footsteps and marry a woman I hate?
I think he might climb out of the
grave and dance on it."
253,VIVIENNE,253,Suit yourself.
254,VIVIENNE (CONT'D),254,"My will, which I have updated to
designate Grant in reception as the
sole beneficiary."
255,ARTHUR,255,You wouldn't! You're my...
256,VIVIENNE,256,...Vivienne? Try me.
257,VIVIENNE (CONT'D),257,"Shall we segue to the timetable
part of our meeting?"
258,HOBSON,258,"Ah. The ring your father gave your
mother, I recall."
259,ARTHUR,259,"(feeling its huge weight)
Did he knock her out with it, then
drive her to the church in the
trunk of his Bentley?"
260,HOBSON,260,No. Your father was a gentleman.
261,ARTHUR,261,"What's gentlemanly about dying
before I knew him? That's just
rude. Did he ever love my mother?
31."
262,HOBSON,262,They had their days.
263,ARTHUR,263,"Ah well. At least he doesn't have
to wake up every day to a woman
with a face like saran wrap
stretched over a gargoyle."
264,ARTHUR (CONT'D),264,What about Naomi?
265,HOBSON,265,Arthur. I say this with love:
266,ARTHUR,266,Uh-oh...
267,HOBSON,267,"Even by modern male standards
you're a breathtakingly immature
little shit. Coupled with the kind
of money you have access to, that's
deadly. Susan may not have a four
hour stand up routine about the
Flatiron Building, but she's a
solid girl who will look after you."
268,ARTHUR,268,I have you for that.
269,HOBSON,269,Not forever.
270,ARTHUR,270,Yes forever. You're Hobson.
271,NAOMI,271,Hello?
272,(SILENCE),272,"Hello?
32.
ARTHUR (O.S, ON PHONE)"
273,(MOCK SINISTER),273,This is your English stalker.
274,"NAOMI
(UNFAZED)",274,"Oh, hi! What's up?"
275,ARTHUR,275,"I'm sorry, I've never really
understood that question. Are you
free tomorrow night?"
276,NAOMI,276,"Sorry, I'm polishing my yacht."
277,ARTHUR,277,"Is that a euphemism for something
naughty?"
278,NAOMI,278,"No, it's a lie. I have a creative
writing class. Tonight?"
279,ARTHUR,279,"I have a contractual commitment.
Friday?"
280,NAOMI,280,You got it.
281,ARTHUR,281,Paper.
282,NAOMI,282,Sorry?
283,ARTHUR,283,"Sorry, I was talking to something
else. So. What do you want to do?
33."
284,NAOMI,284,A movie?
285,ARTHUR,285,"Movie? Come on, you've got to try
harder than that."
286,NAOMI,286,Pizza.
287,ARTHUR,287,What have you always wanted to do?
288,NAOMI,288,"It's a first date, Arthur. Not our
honeymoon."
289,ARTHUR,289,Every date will be our honeymoon.
290,"NAOMI
(MOCK DISGUSTED)",290,"Ewww. Okay, uh, picnic in the
park...or dinner with a view. I
like views."
291,ARTHUR,291,What sort of food do you like?
292,NAOMI,292,"Anything but guts and mushrooms.
Okay, enough questions."
293,ARTHUR,293,"Oh come on. This all helps build up
a profile of you before I trick you
into my basement. I'd hate to not
have your favourite snacks ready."
294,NAOMI,294,"Turkey Jerky and Pez. Are we done?
Just that I....
34."
295,HOBSON,295,"Time to get engaged, Arthur. The
Komodo dragon can wait."
296,ARTHUR,296,Hi! Is it June 19th at 7 pm?
297,BUTLER,297,"No, sir. It's 8.34."
298,ARTHUR,298,"FUCK! We overshot! Time travel can
be a real cunt sometimes, don't you
think? I'll be right back. See you
in an hour and a half ago..."
299,BUTLER,299,"Would you care for anything while
you wait?"
300,ARTHUR,300,"A trampoline and a selection of
woodland creatures if that's not
too much trouble."
301,ARTHUR,301,35.
302,ARTHUR (CONT'D),302,Ah!
303,(TO JESUS),303,Shhhhh...
304,ARTHUR (CONT'D),304,Bollocks.
305,(TO JESUS),305,"Sorry. Actually, you couldn't,
um....you know...
(points to the water)
...turn this into a nice 1990
Romanee Conti, could you?"
306,ARTHUR (CONT'D),306,Cheers ears.
307,ARTHUR (CONT'D),307,"`Genuine Sword of the First
Crusade. Excavated Germany, 1972'."
308,ARTHUR (CONT'D),308,Jesus Fucking Christ!
309,(TO JESUS),309,"Sorry. It's not like you shouted
`Arthur Fucking Bach' when they
pinned you up. Sorry. Sore subject."
310,ARTHUR (CONT'D),310,"Feel the force, Luke."
311,BURT,311,"Arthur!
36."
312,ARTHUR,312,"I, er, had a bit of food stuck in
my teeth and couldn't find a
toothpick."
313,BURT,313,"Heck, this sword went through three
crusades. Beheaded 1000 moslems.
Nothing you can do to harm it."
314,ARTHUR,314,"You don't, um, have anything
stronger, do you?"
315,BURT,315,Sparkling.
316,BURT (CONT'D),316,"`The drunkard and the glutton shalt
come to poverty: and drowsiness
shalt clothe a man with rags.'"
317,ARTHUR,317,"Surely a glass of sherry at
Christmas?"
318,BURT,318,Peace be with you.
319,ARTHUR,319,And also with me.
320,BURT,320,Arthur. Can I be honest with you?
321,ARTHUR,321,"You're the real Slim Shady? I knew
it!
37."
322,BURT,322,"My faith teaches me to hate the
sin, not the sinner. But with you,
I struggle with that belief."
323,ARTHUR,323,"You could switch to Judaism.
(glances up at the fan)
Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I
put the fan on?"
324,BURT,324,"Anyway, Arthur. However I feel
about you, my daughter loves you."
325,ARTHUR,325,"Yes, it's a problem, isn't it?"
326,ARTHUR (CONT'D),326,"Let's knock our heads together and
find a way to stop her loving
me....Got it! We'll tell her I'm on
the sex offenders register....No, I
am and she knows."
327,(BEAT),327,"Joke, sorry. Ah. We'll say I'm gay!
I did once dabble actually, so I
can tell a plausible story."
328,BURT,328,You made love to a guy?
329,ARTHUR,329,"One Moslem doesn't make a mosque,
Burt."
330,BURT,330,"You made love to a Moslem?
38."
331,ARTHUR,331,"No, sir, it was Prince Alois of
Lichtenstein and he made love to
me. The fact that it took three
bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi
full of Krug to loosen me up
confirmed my heterosexuality."
332,BURT,332,"`If there is a man who lies with a
male, they shall surely be put to
death.'"
333,ARTHUR,333,"Crikey. Couldn't there just be some
kind of on-the-spot fine?"
334,BURT,334,"You will stop this talk and marry -
my - fucking..."
335,ARTHUR,335,Oh bollocks.
336,ARTHUR (CONT'D),336,It's a miracle! He is risen!
337,ARTHUR (CONT'D),337,Hi Susan. Erica.
338,SUSAN,338,"Sorry to make you wait, Arthur. I
was talking to your mother. I hear
you have something to ask me!"
339,SUSAN,339,39.
340,ARTHUR,340,Shall we go?
341,ARTHUR,341,"WAITER (O.S.)
...the chef has bathed the bass in
a parceline of Chilean fennel and
finished him with a little gift of
kobe beef. Also I have a
progressive tasting of Kumamoto
oysters en gelee which evolve on
the palate, from light and
refreshing to complex and spicy. A
short story with a twist at the
end! Le fin."
342,ARTHUR,342,"Do you have something with less
words please? The chef doesn't have
to re-cook it, just scrape off the
nouns and trim out all that
gibberish in the middle."
343,SUSAN,343,"He's just joshing, Dominic. I'll do
the skate in wood ear mushroom."
344,WAITER,344,Excellent decision. Sir?
345,ARTHUR,345,A bowl of champagne and a spoon.
346,SUSAN,346,"Arthur, did you really have to be
so icky to Dominic?"
347,ARTHUR,347,"I'm sorry. I just can't handle the
whole specials act. It's not a
Shakespearean soliloquy, it's some
heated up dead things that aren't
on the main menu.
40."
348,SUSAN,348,"You know, I was grumbling to your
mother about how things are with us
sometimes. How I'm sure you're
trying to drive me away..."
349,ARTHUR,349,Um hm.
350,SUSAN,350,"But she was explaining that
relationships are like property
purchases; invest only in high-end
stock, avoid anyone 'up-and-
coming', then hold onto the
property through thick and thin to
deliver maximum return! Isn't that
darling?"
351,ARTHUR,351,"Is it possible to buy the house but
then rent it out? Sorry, joke. I'm
not suggesting pimping you."
352,ARTHUR (CONT'D),352,"Look. You after our first child is
born."
353,SUSAN,353,"Arthur. Why can't you learn to
laugh at genuinely amusing things?"
354,ARTHUR,354,Such as?
355,SUSAN,355,"YouTube clips of babies giggling.
Dane Cook."
356,ARTHUR,356,Susan. Why are we together?
357,SUSAN,357,"I love you, Arthur. And you love
me, whatever you think.
41."
358,ARTHUR,358,"We don't have the same sense of
humour. We don't like the same
films, food, music. You like
horses, I think they're arrogant
idiots..."
359,SUSAN,359,Don't they say opposites attract?
360,ARTHUR,360,"That depends on the opposites.
Racists and the Nation of Islam
don't secretly want to 69 each
other. Susan, you're beautiful.
You're bright. You're fucking
loaded. Is there really no one else
who could make you happy?"
361,SUSAN,361,No.
362,ARTHUR,362,Never?
363,SUSAN,363,"Well, I had a thing at college.
That was serious for a while. But
daddy..."
364,ARTHUR,364,"Daddy what? Prayed to Jesus for it
not to work out, then shot the
bloke behind a meat truck? Because
Jesus would consider that cheating."
365,SUSAN,365,"Ask me, Arthur."
366,ARTHUR,366,"Susan. You're the only woman...at
this table."
367,ARTHUR,367,42.
368,SUSAN,368,"You're not happy, Arthur. Nobody
who drinks like you can be happy."
369,ARTHUR,369,"How do you know? What if the
drunker I get the better it is for
me? Not everyone who drinks is a
poet, Susan. Some of us drink
because we're not poets."
370,SUSAN,370,"A real woman could stop you from
drinking."
371,ARTHUR,371,It'd have to be a real big woman.
372,SUSAN,372,"Ask me, Arthur."
373,SUSAN,373,"ARTHUR (O.S.)
All done."
374,ARTHUR (CONT'D),374,"Susan. Would you marry me? Take the
weekend if you want..."
375,SUSAN,375,"Yes, I'll marry you."
376,WAITER,376,"Ladies and gentleman - the happy
couple!"
377,WAITER,377,43.
378,SUSAN,378,Erica will be the planner.
379,ARTHUR,379,Erica? She hates me.
380,SUSAN,380,"Who I love, she loves."
381,ARTHUR,381,"Oh, come on. She always looks like
she wants to set fire to my face
then put it out with an Uzi."
382,"SUSAN
(ANSWERING)",382,"Hello...thanks, daddy! Sorry, hang
on, I have Erica calling..."
383,ARTHUR,383,"What's going on? I only just bloody
proposed!"
384,ARTHUR (CONT'D),384,"What have I done, Kitt? This
mistake's up there with Hitler
joining his school debating team..."
385,VOICE (FEMALE),385,"Go to bed, Arthur."
386,HOBSON,386,"And stop this self-pitying bibble.
You're going to be fabulously rich."
387,ARTHUR,387,"Maybe I'd rather be fabulously
poor. Some poor people I see look
happy.
44."
388,HOBSON,388,"That's either because they're far
away or you've just given them
money. Arthur, poor people have to
work. They stand for hours in the
rain, waiting for buses full of
other poor people to take them to
things called `jobs' which they do
all year round to pay for holidays
away from those jobs."
389,ARTHUR,389,Don't patronise me. I have a job.
390,HOBSON,390,"Lying drunk on a bale of hay in
riding boots being photographed by
another pampered prick won't
prepare you for the work I mean.
And I don't want to see you suffer.
Take your fish oil."
391,RALPH,391,"When are we getting cable?
NAOMI (O.S.)
We have satellite."
392,RALPH,392,"Honey, that's some bullshit aerial
from the 99 cent Store!"
393,NAOMI,393,It's a satellite dish!
394,RALPH,394,"I read the box! It said `No
satellite fees to pay because does
not receive satellite signals!'
That's like saying `Hey - eat this
plate of broken glass! It won't
make you fat. 'cause IT'S GLASS!'"
395,RALPH,395,45.
396,NAOMI,396,It's better than nothing.
397,RALPH,397,"No it ain't. Honey, I love you, but
you're even cheaper than your mom.
And she bought food from yard
sales."
398,NAOMI,398,"I miss her too, daddy. But now
she's gone and if I'm going to keep
you in grits and Oprah the rest of
your life, you live by my rules."
399,RALPH,399,"But you live like you're preparing
for a war. And you earn a decent
salary."
400,NAOMI,400,"So? I want to know I can look after
you."
401,RALPH,401,"What's he do, this English bum?"
402,NAOMI,402,Who cares? He's nice. He's funny.
403,RALPH,403,"Yeah and I bet that girl said the
same about her date. Honey, stay
home. I don't want you ending up
like that poor girl."
404,NAOMI,404,A bad actress holding her breath?
405,NAOMI (CONT'D),405,Stop watching CSI.
406,NAOMI (CONT'D),406,"46.
ARTHUR (O.S.)
Sorry we drove around so long.
Navigation isn't my driver's strong
point."
407,ARTHUR (CONT'D),407,Or road awareness.
408,ARTHUR,408,Can you put this on please?
409,NAOMI,409,On a first date? Are you crazy?
410,ARTHUR,410,Trust me.
411,NAOMI,411,"Arthur. We're in Battery Park at
night. I've met you once - in the
company of your nanny. You make a
disturbing number of jokes about
stalking and basements. My dad
already has you down as a mass
murderer. And you want me to put on
a blindfold?"
412,ARTHUR,412,"I give you my word - if I kill and
eat you, you'll never see me again."
413,NAOMI,413,"Okay, I'm officially a little
worried."
414,NAOMI,414,47.
415,"ARTHUR
(LAUGHING)",415,Don't worry!
416,ARTHUR (CONT'D),416,You said you wanted a picnic.
417,NAOMI,417,"Arthur, I don't know what to say.
It's beautiful."
418,(LOOKING AROUND),418,Who did all this?
419,ARTHUR,419,"The picnic fairies. Who liaised
with the flower fairies, the candle
fairies, the log fire fairies, the
hidden sound system fairies..."
420,ARTHUR (CONT'D),420,...and the pizza fairies.
421,NAOMI,421,"Did you take account of the heroin
fairies who hang here at night?"
422,ARTHUR,422,"It's nice to keep it simple like
this. I'm sick of Michelin-star
restaurants. All that embarrassing
crap with the specials."
423,NAOMI,423,"Are you kidding? Where I normally
eat, the special's the one that
comes with a free toy."
424,NAOMI,424,48.
425,NAOMI (CONT'D),425,"You're rich rich, aren't you?"
426,ARTHUR,426,I get by.
427,NAOMI,427,"`It doesn't remotely matter how
much or what you spend it on' rich?"
428,NAOMI (CONT'D),428,Craziest thing you ever bought?
429,ARTHUR,429,"I once inadvertently financed a
terrorist cell who said they needed
£100,000 to open a falafel stall."
430,NAOMI,430,"Oh my G-d, you're serious."
431,ARTHUR,431,"What's the craziest thing you ever
told a tour party?"
432,NAOMI,432,"I once said the Manhattan we were
in was actually a movie set built
for `You've got Mail', but that
after the film wrapped, everyone
moved to the set because there was
less crime."
433,NAOMI (CONT'D),433,"Yes, dad? There's a small Tiffany
butter knife about two inches from
his hand but it might take him
eight months to dismember me with
it."
434,(PHONE BLEEPS),434,"Gotta go, battery. Love you too."
435,(PHONE BLEEPS),435,49.
436,NAOMI (CONT'D),436,"Mom died last year. For eight
months dad ate nothing but Popeye's
Chicken n' Biscuits in front of
CSI. So I persuaded him to move in
with me. Where he eats Popeye's
Chicken n' Biscuits in front of
CSI."
437,ARTHUR,437,"Sounds like you're very good to
him."
438,NAOMI,438,"What are you gonna do? All those
years your folks tucked you in, did
their best to stop you from eating
crap in front of the TV. And then
one day, you're the one saying `No,
honey, it's bad for you! Go to
bed.' Weird, huh?"
439,ARTHUR,439,"(not relating at all)
Yeah. I hate that.
(looks at her phone)
Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you
find that?"
440,NAOMI,440,AT&T store in 1998.
441,ARTHUR,441,It's...You've had it twelve years?
442,NAOMI,442,"It's a fine phone. Battery life of
eleven seconds, which cuts the crap
right out of conversations."
443,NAOMI (CONT'D),443,"I can't believe these mofos who
gotta keep up with the latest
bullshit. CDs come along, so out
with the vinyl. Vinyl's back in,
out with the CDs. I just kept the
vinyl. Way cheaper, and I get to be
incredibly hip once every 20
years...."
444,NAOMI (CONT'D),444,50.
445,NAOMI (CONT'D),445,WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
446,ARTHUR,446,"I couldn't decide between picnic in
the park and dinner with a view. So
it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it
ace?"
447,NAOMI,447,"No it is not ace, you crazy English
bastard! This is dangerous!"
448,ARTHUR,448,"Oh, sorry. Forgot. They said to put
these on."
449,"ARTHUR (CONT'D)
(LAUGHING)",449,"Naomi, it's okay! It's very safe.
It's this company called `Aerial
Delights'. They specialise in
catering unusual events at a height
of 180 feet above the ground."
450,ARTHUR (CONT'D),450,"So what got you into the walking
tours?"
451,NAOMI,451,"You're seriously making date small
talk while this is going on?"
452,ARTHUR,452,"Be still. Breathe deep.
(strikes a Zen pose)
`When you can be calm in the midst
of activity, this is the true state
of nature': Huanchu Daoeren.
51."
453,NAOMI,453,"`Lower this freak show to the
ground and get me a cab': Naomi
Snart."
454,ARTHUR,454,"(handing her something)
Taste this truffle."
455,NAOMI,455,"What the hell. Gotta go sometime,
right? At least it won't be years
of pain like mom. Just a few
seconds of screaming and falling
with a truffle in my mouth."
456,ARTHUR,456,So anyway. The tours...
457,"NAOMI
(CALMING HERSELF)",457,"Okay, okay. Be deep. Breathe still.
The tours are a temporary nine year
fill-in until I'm drowned in a
tsunami of apologies from everyone
who failed to recognise my writing
genius first time round."
458,ARTHUR,458,What did you write?
459,NAOMI,459,"A kids' book. I sent a chapter to a
childrens' publisher. Sunshine
Press'. The rejection letter was
the meanest thing I ever read."
460,ARTHUR,460,Kids can be so cruel...
461,"NAOMI
(INTERRUPTING)",461,"Arthur? We have a problem.
52."
462,ARTHUR,462,"I told you, don't worry. These
crane people know what they're
doing!"
463,NAOMI,463,Not that kind of problem.
464,JUNKIE,464,Phone. And the watch. Hurry.
465,ARTHUR,465,"Um. Out of interest, how did you
get up here?"
466,JUNKIE,466,"What you talkin' about, dog?"
467,NAOMI,467,"Great. `Picnic in the sky' followed
by `Robbed in the sky'!"
468,NAOMI (CONT'D),468,"This isn't funny, you lunatic."
469,NAOMI (CONT'D),469,"ARTHUR AND NAOMI
NOOOO!"
470,ARTHUR,470,"OWWW! You don't understand! We're
180 feet up in the sky!"
471,"JUNKIE
(LAUGHS)",471,"You on the same shit as me, yeah?
Good stuff, right?
53."
472,ARTHUR,472,"No, we're not high! Well we are,
but only in the literal sense."
473,"ARTHUR (CONT'D)
(TO NAOMI)",473,"Hit the panic button! It's next to
the truffle station!"
474,ARTHUR (CONT'D),474,Hurry!
475,NAOMI,475,I can't find it. Over here?
476,ARTHUR,476,"No! That's the bouquet of world
hams!"
477,ARTHUR,477,I had fun tonight.
478,NAOMI,478,"I can't believe I'm saying this,
but so did I.
54."
479,ERICA,479,"Summarising Phase Alpha: formal
wear for bridal attendants, groom's
attendants, mens' formal wear, St
John the Divine all confirmed..."
480,"ARTHUR
(TO TAILOR)",480,"Are there breathing holes in the
coffin?"
481,TAILOR,481,I'm sorry?
482,ARTHUR,482,"In case I'm passed out drunk rather
than medically dead?"
483,ERICA,483,"Don't worry, Thomas. This whole
thing's just a joke to Arthur."
484,"ARTHUR
(VERY AFFECTIONATE)",484,"Thanks, Hobnobs. You are good to
me."
485,VIVIENNE,485,Take this away.
486,(TO ERICA),486,Progress on the reception?
487,ERICA,487,"Black inked at the Emery Roth Room
at the Ritz-Carlton."
488,ERICA,488,55.
489,ERICA (CONT'D),489,"A first pass at the guest list.
Bride's family and friends:"
490,ERICA (CONT'D),490,Groom's family and friends:
491,ERICA (CONT'D),491,"We can arrange to screen off the
area behind your guests, Arthur. To
make it seem less desperate."
492,ARTHUR,492,"Sorry, everyone. that graphic's too
colourful and this hangover's a 7.6
on the Richter..the Sickter..."
493,ERICA,493,"Cakes, caterers, floral
arrangements, photographer..."
494,HOBSON,494,"Will there be anything else, sir?"
495,ARTHUR,495,"No, thanks."
496,"HOBSON
(TO VIVIENNE)",496,Ma'am?
497,VIVIENNE,497,No. You can leave.
498,ARTHUR,498,"Why all this crap now? What's the
rush anyway?"
499,BURT,499,"The wedding is in a month, Arthur.
56."
500,ARTHUR,500,"A month? I was thinking more sort
of ten, fifteen years. Just to
really enjoy the anticipation of
the big day."
501,ERICA,501,Where are you going?
502,ARTHUR,502,"(gets out his cellphone)
Sorry, Dwight D. Bridalshower,
Operation Ball and Chain will have
to wait."
503,ARTHUR,503,Here we are.
504,NAOMI,504,"We're not going to end up in the
Hudson again, are we?"
505,ARTHUR,505,I can promise you won't get wet.
506,NAOMI,506,Are you okay?
507,ARTHUR,507,"Yeah, fine. Actually...
57."
508,NAOMI,508,"Hey, Richey Rich. Want to go
somewhere really romantic?"
509,ARTHUR,509,Everything is 99 cents?
510,NAOMI,510,"Yip. A whole penny less than those
bourgeois assholes at the Dollar
Store."
511,ARTHUR,511,"`Warning: This product contains
chromium, which may be linked to
chronic bronchitis and reproductive
hazards."""
512,NAOMI,512,"That one was on the news. Everyone
else recalled them, the pussies.
Not my 99 Cent!"
513,ARTHUR,513,"Maybe China's trying to wipe out
the west's children one by one."
514,NAOMI,514,"Oh, I love this place."
515,ARTHUR,515,"Why?
58."
516,NAOMI,516,"Well, I'd like you to believe it's
because I'm a poor girl reduced to
buying `Depressed Chef' burgers-in-
a-can to Right Said Fred because I
don't know where my next paycheck
is coming from. But the truth is -
bargains get me hot. Got it from
ma. Drives my dad crazy. The tour?"
517,ARTHUR,517,Yes please.
518,NAOMI,518,"Looking west, the ladies' hygiene
products. Note that the more
natural-sounding the name, e.g.
this 'Vermont Breeze' Feminine
Spray, the more lethal chemicals it
contains. Watch out for the
products cunningly labelled to make
the dumber consumer think they're
getting the real thing: 'Special
J', 'Crampbell's Soup', ''Aunt
Janina's' Maple-Style Syrup..."
519,NAOMI (CONT'D),519,"And ah, the music: Dated sounds for
lonely people to buy cheap shit to."
520,NAOMI (CONT'D),520,"I once watched a woman shoplift an
8-pack of toilet scrubbers down her
panty hose to 'Everything I do, I
do it for you'."
521,NAOMI (CONT'D),521,Why are you staring at me?
522,ARTHUR,522,"Just fascinated.
59."
523,NAOMI,523,You're good at fascinated.
524,ARTHUR,524,You're good at fascinating.
525,ARTHUR (CONT'D),525,Are you okay? Let me help you.
526,OLD WOMAN,526,Not that one.
527,ARTHUR,527,"(offers her another)
This one?"
528,OLD WOMAN,528,"(shaking the tin)
No. There's less beans in it."
529,ARTHUR,529,This one?
530,OLD WOMAN,530,"(sniffs the tin)
No."
531,ARTHUR,531,This one?
532,ARTHUR (CONT'D),532,No. I think I hear a mouse inside.
533,ARTHUR (CONT'D),533,"Oh my G-d. This is a good one. No
rodents. Packed."
534,ARTHUR (CONT'D),534,"Quick, before someone gets it."
535,ARTHUR (CONT'D),535,60.
536,"OLD WOMAN
(TO NAOMI)",536,"You got a good one here, honey."
537,ARTHUR,537,Look. Us in a year's time.
538,ARTHUR (CONT'D),538,"If you got ill, I'd care for you."
539,NAOMI,539,I'll get ill.
540,NAOMI (CONT'D),540,"Oh, man, Phil Collins. Gotta get
out when they start playing Phil
Collins. Want to see how to get a
quarter from a shopping cart?"
541,ERICA,541,Tiger Woods has confirmed!
542,ARTHUR,542,I didn't know you knew him.
543,SUSAN,543,I don't.
544,ARTHUR,544,Why is he coming?
545,SUSAN,545,"He agreed to daddy's fee. This is
going to be the happiest day of my
life!"
546,SUSAN (CONT'D),546,"Why is she here all the time?
61."
547,ARTHUR,547,"If you can bring Erica, I can bring
Hobson."
548,SUSAN,548,She's my wedding planner.
549,ARTHUR,549,She's my Hobson.
550,"HOBSON
(WHISPERING)",550,Tell Naomi. That's an order.
551,ARTHUR,551,"Reminiscent of a French castle
perched 500 feet above New York,
the penthouse was known from early
days as the `Chateau in the Sky'."
552,NAOMI,552,"A second ballroom. Obviously. Gotta
have a second ballroom."
553,ARTHUR,553,"Where George Gershwin and the
Astors danced to Shep Fields and
his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra."
554,ARTHUR (CONT'D),554,"Come on, cheap girl. We can be Fred
Austere and Stingy Rogers."
555,"NAOMI
(PULLING AWAY)",555,"I just need one of your collection
of bathrooms."
556,ARTHUR,556,"Behind the telephone box fish tank.
See you on the balcony.
62."
557,NAOMI,557,Hobson?
558,HOBSON,558,"He's not like other men, you know."
559,NAOMI,559,"I think I realised that as I
plunged into the Hudson with a
junkie. But I like him. He's fun."
560,HOBSON,560,I know he is. That's the problem.
561,NAOMI,561,What does that mean?
562,HOBSON,562,I'm sure Arthur will explain.
563,ARTHUR,563,Your kids' book. What was it about?
564,NAOMI,564,"`Vlad the Inhaler'. About an
asthmatic boy detective."
565,ARTHUR,565,Be serious.
566,NAOMI,566,"Oh, it was dumb. `The Boy Whose
Heart Escaped'. It was about this
kid who wakes up to find his heart
has climbed out and is shinning
down the drainpipe to freedom."
567,ARTHUR,567,"I love it.
63."
568,NAOMI,568,"Rainbow Press said it was too
disturbing. But it wasn't literal -
there wasn't a kid lying there with
a gaping hole in his chest. It was
just this cute little heart
bouncing up and down shouting `You
can't catch me, mofo!'. I'm
paraphrasing."
569,ARTHUR,569,Did he catch the heart?
570,NAOMI,570,Never got that far.
571,NAOMI (CONT'D),571,"You like the hooch, don't you?"
572,ARTHUR,572,"Only if I'm sad, happy or bored.
There's this bit in a book Hobson
used to read me as a kid that says
it all: `We must stop eating
cookies, Frog!' cried Toad, as he
ate another.'"
573,NAOMI,573,"Frog and Toad! I loved Frog and
Toad!"
574,"ARTHUR
(FROM MEMORY)",574,"`Frog put the cookies in a box.
`There' he said. Now we will not
eat any more cookies.' `But we can
open the box.' Frog tied some
string around the box. `There' he
said, `Now we will not eat any more
cookies'. `But we can cut the
string and open the box'."
575,ARTHUR (CONT'D),575,"So Frog took the box outside. He
shouted in a loud voice, `Hey
birds, here are cookies!' Birds
came from everywhere. They picked
up all the cookies in their beaks
and flew away. `"
576,(MORE),576,64.
577,ARTHUR (CONT'D),577,"Now we have no more cookies to eat'
`Excellent!' said Toad, `I am going
home now to bake a cake.'"
578,(BEAT),578,Classic addict.
579,NAOMI,579,"That was beautiful. It's like you
read it yesterday."
580,HOBSON (OOV),580,"Frog and Toad stayed on the island
all afternoon."
581,HOBSON (CONT'D),581,"They ate wet sandwiches without
iced tea. They were two close
friends sitting alone together."
582,ARTHUR,582,"I couldn't tell her, Hobson. She
isn't the Komodo dragon. She's my
toad."
583,HOBSON,583,You're quite sure about this?
584,ARTHUR,584,Yes.
585,HOBSON,585,"(under her breath)
Oh, bollocks."
586,HOBSON,586,65.
587,RALPH,587,"I don't know, honey. What's this
teabag even doing here? Couldn't he
make it in Lord of the Rings land?"
588,NAOMI,588,"Not that it matters, but he's a
billionaire."
589,RALPH,589,"You have my full permission to
marry him."
590,GRANT,590,"Bravo, Vivienne! Well done!"
591,ARTHUR,591,"I'd be wary, Grant. She's planning
to ride you around the course next.
Her last boyfriend broke his ankle
jumping that ditch. Had to be
destroyed on the spot."
592,VIVIENNE,592,"Arthur. What's so urgent that you
had to come all the way out here?"
593,ARTHUR,593,"I'm in love. With a woman who isn't
exactly who you'd describe as
Susan. She's called Naomi."
594,VIVIENNE,594,"Arthur, we've been through this!"
595,ARTHUR,595,Won't you at least meet her?
596,VIVIENNE,596,What family is she from?
597,ARTHUR,597,"The Snarts of Detroit.
66."
598,VIVIENNE,598,Never heard of them.
599,ARTHUR,599,"No, because they're normal. She's a
walking tour guide, her dad's a
retired car worker."
600,VIVIENNE,600,"Susan will generate quality sons,
not oil-soaked car monkeys."
601,ARTHUR,601,"Unbelievable! Why don't you just
keep me here, pay a servant to wank
me into a bottle once a day..."
602,VIVIENNE,602,Arthur...
603,ARTHUR,603,"...then inject it all into a field
of heiresses and see who farts out
a thoroughbred first?"
604,VIVIENNE,604,We need an heir!
605,ARTHUR,605,"Fine! You can have one with Stevey
Steroids here! Surely even your
uterus has had a face lift by now."
606,"GRANT
(STEPPING IN)",606,"That's enough, Arthur..."
607,ARTHUR,607,"None of your business, J Crew."
608,GRANT,608,"You are so ungrateful to your
mother. She adores you!"
609,VIVIENNE,609,Arthur. Come back here.
610,ARTHUR,610,"You can shove your inheritance up
your horse's arse!
67."
611,VIVIENNE,611,"Suit yourself, Arthur. Follow your
heart. But do be aware I consider
what you've squandered so far an
advance on your inheritance. That's
about $17 million."
612,ARTHUR,612,"Why would you do that? You'd never
get it back."
613,VIVIENNE,613,"No. But you'd spend the rest of
your life in court. There's a
simple solution to all this. Marry
Susan. And cheat with the nobody
from Queens."
614,NAOMI,614,Have you been at the cookies?
615,ARTHUR,615,I ate the whole jar.
616,NAOMI,616,"(realising it's serious)
Oh, man. What? What?"
617,ARTHUR,617,"I'm engaged. To another Susan.
Woman. Engaged to another woman."
618,ARTHUR (CONT'D),618,I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
619,NAOMI,619,"What are you talking about? This is
bullshit. Who do you think you are?
Is this some rich guy thing?"
620,ARTHUR,620,"I was going to tell you! I just...
68."
621,NAOMI,621,"Yeah, yeah, you just."
622,ARTHUR,622,"Please, Naomi! I didn't mean for it
to get to this! I planned to just
be your friend but then I started
to fall for you and I thought `I
can't marry Susan, I might fall for
Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to
marry Susan or I'll be poor so I
won't fall for Naomi' But then I
did fall for you! Because you're
brainy and funny and gorgeous and
too smart to do walking tours.
You're too smart, Snart. Smart
Snart. There's a 99 cent cereal."
623,(BEAT),623,"Anyway, so I went to see Vivienne,
and I said `I can't marry Susan, I
love Naomi she's my Frog my Toad' I
don't know any more."
624,NAOMI,624,You're frog.
625,ARTHUR,625,"Thanks. Then she said `Noooo, if
you don't marry Susan, I'll make
you pay all the inheritance money
back even if you can't - ha ha ha'.
Okay she didn't laugh but she might
as well have, the evil cow. Because
it's like all the money ever and
they'll put not just me but both of
us in prison and your dad, like in
Dickens. There'll be ghosts, and
Oliver and...."
626,NAOMI,626,"Maybe if I'd spotted this facet of
your personality earlier we
wouldn't be having this
conversation."
627,ARTHUR,627,"Toad? Stay a bit longer. Please?
69."
628,NAOMI,628,Why?
629,ARTHUR,629,"'cause it'll reduce the proportion
of my life I'll spend feeling
utterly miserable."
630,NAOMI,630,"Bye, Arthur."
631,ARTHUR,631,"Bea Arthur? What's she got to do
with all this?"
632,NAOMI,632,"It's going to be okay. I'll get you
a beer, yeah?"
633,RALPH,633,"I just have to be alone for a
minute...Oh, G-d, I can't bear
it..."
634,RALPH,634,70.
635,"NAOMI
(YAWNS)",635,"Designed by William Van Allen and
inspired by the machine age of the
1920s, the Chrysler...
RUDE MALE TOURIST
Hey. I got a question."
636,NAOMI,636,"Please, interrupt. Hell, who wants
to come home with me and butt in
with questions while I'm watching
Letterman? `Yo. How tall is Dave?'"
637,(BEAT),637,"Sorry, sir. Late night, no sleep,
long day. What's your question?
71."
638,(BEAT),638,"RUDE MALE TOURIST
How can I just let you walk away,
just let you leave without a trace?"
639,FEMALE TOURIST,639,"When I stand here taking every
breath with you, ooh..."
640,MALE TOURIST 2,640,"You're the only one who really knew
me at all."
641,NAOMI,641,"What is going on?
OLD FEMALE TOURIST
How can you just walk away from me,
when all I can do is watch you
leave?
TEENAGE BOY TOURIST
'cause we've shared the laughter
and the pain..."
642,NEWSSTAND GUY,642,And even shared the tears.
643,NEWSSTAND GUY,643,"NEWSSTAND GUY (CONT'D)
You're the only one who really knew
me at all."
644,ARTHUR,644,"(lip syncing too)
So take a look at me now, 'cause
there's just an empty space.
And there's nothing left here to
remind me, just the memory of your
face."
645,(MORE),645,72.
646,ARTHUR (CONT'D),646,"Take a look at me now, `cause
there's just an empty space, And
you coming back to me is against
all odds and that's what I've got
to face...Just take a look at me
now."
647,NAOMI,647,"Sorry to be a wet blanket, folks.
he's getting married. But I guess
he didn't choreograph that bit for
you."
648,ARTHUR,648,"But..but this took ages to
rehearse. I had the frog outfit
specially made. These aren't actual
tourists."
649,NAOMI,649,"I gathered that, Arthur. Are you
capable of doing anything without
it being a grand gesture?"
650,ARTHUR,650,What do you mean?
651,NAOMI,651,"It's like Hobson said. You're not
like other men. If you were normal,
if the money and the booze didn't
cloud everything, you'd deal with
the fact that you're engaged,
rather than just looking for ways
to win me back. But it was a lovely
routine, really. Fantastic outfit."
652,ARTHUR,652,I just wanted to see you.
653,"NAOMI
(SYMPATHETIC)",653,"You need to see someone, Arthur.
Seriously.
73."
654,ARTHUR,654,"Hobson! Female Tom Hanks has had a
haircut! Hobson?"
655,MARTY,655,"It says here you shouldn't forget
to clean your junk. I guess that's
what...'genitahlio-ah' is."
656,ARTHUR,656,Marty? What are you doing there?
657,MARTY,657,"Hobson left me in charge. She's
gone to bed. She had a headache."
658,ARTHUR,658,"She's had quite a few headaches
lately."
659,MARTY,659,She blacked out.
660,HOBSON,660,"Put my bears back on, Arthur."
661,ARTHUR,661,Not until you answer my question.
662,HOBSON,662,"I'm travelling down a white tunnel.
To - a garden? Mother? Father? Why
is it so hot? Who's the red
gentleman with the big pitchfork?"
663,ARTHUR,663,"Will you cut it out?
74."
664,HOBSON,664,"Arthur. There are three books. This
is important. Take them back to the
library..."
665,ARTHUR,665,"Hobson, please. Don't die any more.
It's getting very boring."
666,HOBSON,666,"Arthur. Old women, like bears, get
sore heads. Are you okay? You look
a little lost."
667,ARTHUR,667,Naomi doesn't want to see me.
668,HOBSON,668,"A terrible shame she had to go. A
little tart like that could have
saved you a fortune in prostitutes."
669,ARTHUR,669,"Listen, old woman. Don't ever talk
about Naomi that way again. What
gives you the right to be such a
snob? You're just...you're just...
Mary Poppins with a menopause!"
670,ARTHUR (CONT'D),670,"Hobson, I've never raised my voice
to you. I'm sorry."
671,HOBSON,671,"I'm sorry too. You know, Arthur,
you may be growing up."
672,ARTHUR,672,Do you want anything?
673,HOBSON,673,I want to be younger.
674,ARTHUR,674,"Sorry, it's your job to be older."
675,(THINKS),675,"Hobson. If you're feeling better
tomorrow, will you accompany me
somewhere?
75."
676,HOBSON,676,"Of course, Arthur."
677,HOBSON,677,"ARTHUR (O.S.)
How do I look?"
678,ARTHUR (CONT'D),678,"I can't have this getting out. I'm
in the public eye."
679,HOBSON,679,"Yes, it would be disastrous to harm
such a dignified profile."
680,HOBSON (CONT'D),680,"It's going to be okay, Arthur."
681,MEGAN,681,"I was waking up four, five, six
mornings a week in different mens'
beds..."
682,MEGAN (CONT'D),682,I wanted to die. To be nobody.
683,JAMES,683,"I steal from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's pedal car so I
could score junk...
76."
684,ARTHUR,684,Jesus....
685,JAMES,685,"I accidentally backed my car over
my mother outside Walgreens..."
686,"HOBSON
(WHISPERS)",686,"Marty! This isn't a sports bar in
Chicago. These people aren't here
to brag."
687,"JAMES
(SOBBING)",687,"I had a business, a home and it's
all gone! I'm in this fucking grave
and they're pouring the earth in!"
688,ARTHUR,688,"Whoooaaahh. Okay, cut. I don't know
about anyone else, but this isn't
exactly killing my thirst."
689,LEADER,689,"Well why did you come...What's your
name?"
690,ARTHUR,690,Gandalf.
691,ARTHUR (CONT'D),691,"I'm sorry, you're not going to
convince me my life isn't fun."
692,(TO JAMES),692,"And no offence but if I ran over my
mother, I'd be out celebrating.
Which is what I plan to do right
now. Come on, Hobson. Marty."
693,(TO JAMES),693,"WOMAN (O.S)
I'm Jane. And I believe I have a
dependence on alcohol..."
694,(TO JAMES),694,77.
695,HOBSON,695,"...and because I have done nothing
with the astonishing opportunities
handed to me, apart from pissing
away my inheritance and drinking
enough to kill a rhino."
696,HOBSON (CONT'D),696,"But imagine being me! I once ended
up in bed with the daughters of
three of the Rolling Stones. But a)
I don't remember a thing about it,
b) apparently I was sick on two of
the women before c) losing control
of my bladder on the third. All
such fun...until the strangers I
pay to be my friends have gone, the
fog parts and there's a hole so
big, you could pour all the
champagne in the world into it and
never fill it up. But I've got so
much potential, a good heart, I'm a
good person, even if I've
completely wasted my short,
precious life because I somehow
convinced myself that happiness is
a Komodo dragon, a case of booze
and the memory of having once
stripped naked to Beethoven for a
coachload of German tourists who I
met outside the Rainforest Cafe."
697,ARTHUR,697,It's always the quiet ones.
698,ARTHUR,698,"Thanks, Hobson. Maybe you can go
every time I crave a drink?
78."
699,ARTHUR (CONT'D),699,"Susan? Look, I know the wedding
date is set. But fancy bringing it
forward? I just want to get it over
with. In a good way. Think about
it, yeah?"
700,ARTHUR (CONT'D),700,"It's the agony of possibility,
Hobson. It just hurts too much to
know I could still be with Naomi if
I had the guts."
701,HOBSON,701,"Just promise you'll never ask me to
sleep with Susan for you."
702,NAOMI,702,"Arthur, if that's..."
703,(BEAT),703,"Hello? Yes. Yes, I did...Yes.
Sorry? Really? Well I worked pretty
hard on it..Love to...Love
to...What time?"
704,NAOMI (CONT'D),704,I'll call in dead to work. Bye.
705,HOBSON,705,"Good afternoon, Mr Snart. Is Naomi
here?
79."
706,RALPH,706,You must be the nanny.
707,HOBSON,707,I must be.
708,HOBSON (CONT'D),708,"Please stop this, I can't inhale
and am in danger of treading on one
of your knuckles."
709,HOBSON (CONT'D),709,"If you and your undershirt would
walk two paces back I could enter
this dwelling."
710,NAOMI,710,"Well, well."
711,RALPH,711,"Ever since I met Arthur I liked
him. We have to make sure these two
wonderful kids stay together..."
712,HOBSON,712,"Try not to talk. It's not your
words but the breath which bears
them. Perhaps you could repair to
the East Wing and make me a cup of
tea? I wish to speak to Naomi."
713,RALPH,713,"Sure, sure."
714,HOBSON,714,"Arthur is having a pre-wedding
party tonight. You should come."
715,NAOMI,715,"Oh, should I? Are all the other
girls he passed up going too?"
716,NAOMI,716,80.
717,HOBSON,717,"Don't you want to show Arthur how
well you're doing?"
718,NAOMI,718,"Tell him thanks, but I have a
deadline."
719,HOBSON,719,"Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's
far too decent to be involved in
something so tawdry. You could
bring your father. A magical
experience before he's too big to
leave this apartment."
720,"NAOMI
(DISBELIEF)",720,"Why would I go to this? Why would I
do that to myself?"
721,HOBSON,721,"My dear, if there's one thing old
women can tell, it's young men in
love. And the food promises to be
breathtakingly free."
722,NAOMI,722,Are you alright?
723,HOBSON,723,"Better than you, dear."
724,NAOMI,724,"You really look out for Arthur,
don't you?"
725,HOBSON,725,"Yes. And it is a job that I
recommend highly."
726,HOBSON (CONT'D),726,"You really look out for this
gentleman, from what I've heard."
727,NAOMI,727,"Ah, what am I gonna do? The no-kill
pet shelter won't take him."
728,NAOMI,728,81.
729,HOBSON,729,"Thank you. Would you go the
bathroom and commence washing? You
only have three hours and it could
be quite a project."
730,NAOMI,730,"I appreciate what you're trying to
do but I'm not going to that party."
731,HOBSON,731,Suit yourself.
732,NAOMI,732,Have you seen a doctor?
733,HOBSON,733,Yes. And he has seen me.
734,NAOMI,734,"I think Arthur has a very good
friend. May I kiss you on the
cheek?"
735,HOBSON,735,"Is it something you feel strongly
about?"
736,NAOMI,736,Yes.
737,NAOMI (CONT'D),737,Dad! Call 911.
738,NAOMI (CONT'D),738,82.
739,VOCALIST,739,"Thanks. We're going to move things
up tempo now with `The Only Thing
That Looks Good On Me Is You.'"
740,VIVIENNE,740,"Splendid affair, Susan."
741,SUSAN,741,"Don't thank me, thank Erica."
742,NAOMI,742,"With all due respect, Hobson,
you're talking out of your frumpy
English ass. Arthur needs to know!"
743,HOBSON,743,"You are not to pull him out of that
party on my behalf."
744,(BEAT),744,Hello? Naomi!
745,RALPH,745,"You're gonna get through this,
babe. Then who knows what the
future may hold?"
746,DOOR MAN,746,"Excuse me, madam. Name? Madam?
83."
747,NAOMI,747,Snart plus one.
748,PASSING WOMAN,748,Nice dress. Vera Wang?
749,NAOMI,749,"Ross Dress For Less. You know where
Arthur is?"
750,"PASSING WOMAN
(SHRUGS)",750,Sorry.
751,BURT,751,"When Arthur proposed to my
daughter, I was overjoyous. The
Bach-Templemeads are my kind of
people: classy. Respectable. Well
spoken. People like in Shakespeare
in Love, who esprouse the same
values I have always upheld both in
my business and spiritual life. But
tonight isn't about me or America's
leading independent formula brand."
752,ARTHUR,752,"Thank you, Burt! I've actually
prepared a little surprise song
with my friends here.
84."
753,ARTHUR (CONT'D),753,"Why does cash suddenly appear,
every time you are near?"
754,ARTHUR (CONT'D),754,"Just like me, it longs to be, close
to Sue. Why do cars fall out of the
sky, all of which, I can buy..."
755,(STOPS),755,I'll sing a proper song.
756,(SINGS),756,"You say potayto and I say potahto,
You say tomayto and I say tomahto,
potayto, potahto, tomayto, tomahto,
Let's call the whole thing off! You
say AA, and I say `no way', you say
`Red Bull' and I say `Go away,
Rehab, No way, Red Bull..."
757,JUSTIN,757,We meet again!
758,NAOMI,758,Yeah. Have you seen Arthur?
759,JUSTIN,759,The ballroom. I'll take you to him.
760,JUSTIN (CONT'D),760,I'm so happy for Arthur and Susan.
761,JUSTIN (CONT'D),761,Isn't she beautiful?
762,NAOMI,762,"Of course she is. Why would Arthur
marry a pig?
85."
763,JUSTIN,763,What business is your family in?
764,NAOMI,764,"Hm? Oh, I'm the heiress to a
fortune built on small pets."
765,JUSTIN,765,I'm sorry?
766,NAOMI,766,"Hamsters, mice, doglets..."
767,JUSTIN,767,Doglets?
768,NAOMI,768,"Tiny dogs. The technology's not
perfect. Seeing a horse the size of
a can of soup fall dead before your
eyes - that shit stays with you."
769,NAOMI,769,Are you sure he's this way?
770,JUSTIN,770,Absolutely.
771,NAOMI,771,"(to a WOMAN)
Excuse me. Have you seen Arthur?"
772,WOMAN,772,That way. The ballroom.
773,NAOMI,773,"Bye, Justin."
774,DOOR MAN,774,"Excuse me, madam. You're not an
authorized guest.
86."
775,NAOMI,775,"I know that. I'm here to give
Arthur some very important news."
776,DOOR MAN,776,"Of course you are.
(takes her arm)
Shall we discuss this outside?"
777,"NAOMI
(SHOUTS)",777,Get your hands off me!
778,ARTHUR,778,"It's okay, Jeff. She can stay."
779,NAOMI,779,"Arthur, can I talk to you?"
780,NAOMI,780,"MAN IN A WHITE COAT
We ran tests. It was just a dizzy
spell. We'll be sending her home
tonight."
781,ARTHUR,781,But what about the other blackouts?
782,HOBSON,782,"Arthur, I'm fine. Do not leave that
party."
783,HOBSON,783,"HOBSON (O.S, OFF)
Especially now that Naomi is there."
784,ARTHUR,784,"She's fine. They're sending her
home. Do you want a drink?
87."
785,NAOMI,785,"No, thanks, Arthur. I should go."
786,ARTHUR,786,"But you came all this way. There's
ridiculously fancy food, there's..."
787,NAOMI,787,"Arthur. Please. Can you just call
me a cab?"
788,ARTHUR,788,You're a cab.
789,ARTHUR (CONT'D),789,Shit. Hobson usually...
790,NAOMI,790,Orders cabs to take the girls away?
791,ARTHUR,791,"Thank you for coming all this way.
I'm sorry for all the stupid
presents and calls and gestures."
792,NAOMI,792,It's okay.
793,NAOMI (CONT'D),793,She was a looker from the get-go.
794,ARTHUR,794,What were you like as a kid?
795,NAOMI,795,"Nuts. I thought the moon followed
me. I would walk and think the moon
went any place that I did. I
thought it meant something special
would happen. So I've been waiting.
What an ass."
796,NAOMI,796,88.
797,ARTHUR,797,Dance?
798,NAOMI,798,"Arthur. We've been through this.
Call that cab please."
799,MANDY MILLER,799,"To Bombay, a travelling circus
came, they brought an intelligent
elephant and Nellie was her name..."
800,"NAOMI
(LAUGHING)",800,What the bejeezus is this?
801,ARTHUR,801,Hobson used to sing it to me.
802,(SINGING ALONG),802,"One dark night, she slipped her
iron chain. Off she ran to
Hindustan and was never seen again.
Nellie the Elephant packed her
bags, And said goodbye to the
circus, Off she went with a
trumpety trump, Trump trump
trump..."
803,VIVIENNE,803,Is this the tour guide?
804,ARTHUR,804,She's a writer.
805,NAOMI,805,Is this the Vivienne?
806,VIVIENNE,806,"Crowded field, writing.
89."
807,ARTHUR,807,"Maybe someone will see her
potential."
808,VIVIENNE,808,"We all know who's seen her
potential."
809,NAOMI,809,Meaning?
810,VIVIENNE,810,"Oh, of course, you don't know, do
you?"
811,ARTHUR,811,"Vivienne, please. Don't..."
812,NAOMI,812,What is going on here?
813,VIVIENNE,813,"My son became fond of you. You're
not the first. Or the last, I
imagine. Anyway I was scanning his
monthly expenses - which always
makes for entertaining reading, all
those gifts for all those girls -
and found he'd bought an entire
publishing company called...what
was it now? Rainbow Press."
814,NAOMI,814,"You bought Rainbow press? So you
could tell them to publish my book?"
815,VIVIENNE,815,"He knows people, dear. I'm sure you
do too, though the people you know
tend not to own books, let alone
publishers. Arthur, I trust we'll
see you back at the party? Susan's
a little worried."
816,ARTHUR,816,"NAOMI! PLEASE! I didn't think I
would ever see you again. I was
just trying to give you some...
90."
817,"NAOMI
(GASPS)",817,"Confidence? Self esteem isn't a
gift, Arthur! It isn't a fur coat
or a thousand billion orchids or an
apartment made from truffles or
whatever else you rich freaks use
to express love!"
818,ARTHUR,818,I do express love! I love you!
819,NAOMI,819,Don't say that!
820,ARTHUR,820,"You just told me to! And stop going
on about me being rich! You think
it's easy being trapped by money?"
821,NAOMI,821,"Hello, Amnesty? Come quick!
Arthur's being held against his
will in Guantamoney Bay!"
822,ARTHUR,822,Abu Greed?
823,NAOMI,823,"Stop riffing with me! How dare you
do what you did. I didn't need your
money to feel good about myself!"
824,ARTHUR,824,No. Being cheap gives you that.
825,NAOMI,825,Huh?
826,ARTHUR,826,"At least I'm prepared to have fun.
To live. I'm not all `Oooh look at
me with my antique food, aren't I
cool?' And...and...your phone's
RUBBISH! It's made of bits of old
doorbell and vibrator, I bet you
can only get calls from 1994 on it!
91."
827,"NAOMI
(BOILS OVER)",827,"As long as I don't get any from a
drunk, rich fuck up like you!"
828,SUSAN,828,Hello? I heard shouting.
829,NAOMI,829,"I'm an employee of Arthur's. I came
to complain about the conditions."
830,ARTHUR,830,"Naomi, please..."
831,NAOMI,831,"Mr Bach-Templemead, I know you
thought putting half and half in
the staff kitchen was an
improvement."
832,(REALLY ANGRY),832,"But some people prefer Coffee Mate!
You were disrespectful. I quit!"
833,SUSAN,833,Because you changed the creamer?
834,(BEAT),834,"Arthur, Marty called from the
hospital."
835,ARTHUR,835,"It's okay, Hobson's fine. I spoke
to her doctor."
836,SUSAN,836,Apparently you didn't.
837,HOBSON,837,It's just a headache!
838,ARTHUR,838,"Stop saying that! You bribed a
hospital orderly to tell me you
were okay!
92."
839,HOBSON,839,"Oh, bothersnaps. What do doctors
know?"
840,ARTHUR,840,"Da dahhhh! I give you the amazing
costly, health-giving presents!"
841,ARTHUR (CONT'D),841,"'Wake up and Smell the Carcass'..
(reads the DVD)

stomach-churning music videos and
deathly live performances...'"
842,ARTHUR (CONT'D),842,"Put this on, please."
843,HOBSON,843,I don't want to put it on.
844,ARTHUR,844,Put it on. Or I'll fire you.
845,(PAUSE),845,"Okay, or I won't fire you."
846,"HOBSON
(VADER VOICE)",846,"How much did you waste on this
poppycock?"
847,"HOBSON (CONT'D)
(VADER VOICE)",847,"I see you've decided not to grow up
after all."
848,MARTY,848,She sounds like Darth Invader!
849,HOBSON,849,"Why, Arthur?
93."
850,HOBSON,850,"VOICEOVER (O.S.)
Stargazer, known for her
distinctive white mottled back..."
851,VOICEOVER (CONT'D),851,"...is determined to catch the
salmon, despite the treacherous
rapids..."
852,DOCTOR,852,"Mr Bach-Templemead? Do you have a
moment?"
853,ARTHUR,853,Home? That's great news. Isn't it?
854,ARTHUR,854,How did this get here?
855,HOBSON,855,I have no idea.
856,ARTHUR,856,"You might have a brain tumour but
you're not a complete veggie burger
just yet. Has Naomi been here?
94."
857,HOBSON,857,"She dropped by once or twice.
Frightful needy trollop."
858,ARTHUR,858,I thought she gave up writing.
859,HOBSON,859,"Just trying to spare her outright
humiliation while I'm still here."
860,ARTHUR,860,"Don't wear yourself out. You're not
going anywhere soon."
861,ARTHUR (CONT'D),861,"World's most advanced heart rate
monitor. The tiniest problem will
alert your own private platoon of
paramedics camped out downstairs..."
862,HOBSON,862,"Arthur. I've loved caring for you
so much. But you'll never grow up
with me around. So either I retire.
Or I die. Option 1 involves too
much paperwork and blather with
having to find somewhere else to
live. And no offence to you, dear
boy..."
863,HOBSON (CONT'D),863,"...but I think we've exhausted the
bear-based entertainment. Which
leaves option 2."
864,HOBSON (CONT'D),864,"You're a good son, Arthur. You can
do anything with your life that you
want. Just like I did.
95."
865,ARTHUR,865,"But you spent half of it looking
after a spoilt drunk twat."
866,HOBSON,866,"Exactly. Sorry Arthur. I'm past my
use-by date."
867,ARTHUR,867,"Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this
one. I need you to care for me.
(holds up a pill)
Now take your fish oil."
868,ARTHUR,868,Hobson?
869,ARTHUR (CONT'D),869,"HOBSON!
(hammering the machine)
Why the fuck has the stupid thing
not gone off?"
870,(SHOUTS),870,GET UP HERE! SHE'S NOT...
871,(SHOUTS),871,96.
872,ARTHUR,872,"Would Frog ever get up again? Or
would he just sit in his tank,
crying and soiling himself until he
died of dehydration because he
didn't even have the energy to eat
a wet sandwich."
873,ARTHUR (CONT'D),873,"Hobson! Why are you in there when I
need you?
(lifts lid off urn)
HOBSON!"
874,ARTHUR (CONT'D),874,Arrrrgghhh!
875,ARTHUR (CONT'D),875,Sorry.
876,MARTY,876,How's the tea?
877,ARTHUR,877,"Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty."
878,MARTY,878,Want to talk about the Cubs game?
879,ARTHUR,879,Nahhh. Can I be alone please?
880,ARTHUR,880,97.
881,ARTHUR,881,"(leaving a message)
Naomi? I doubt you'll ever get
this, because your voicemail
probably consists of a 4000 year
old woman who writes the message
down in hieroglyphics then loses it
down the back of her incontinence
loin cloth. Hobson died. Hobson
died and I've fallen apart..."
882,ARTHUR (CONT'D),882,Marty! Can you get that? Marty!
883,(INTO PHONE),883,Naomi? Could you get it? Hello?
884,VIVIENNE,884,"Arthur! You haven't answered the
phone for eight days. Susan's
beside herself. What's going on?
98."
885,ARTHUR,885,"What do you think's going on?
Hobson died."
886,VIVIENNE,886,"Oh, that."
887,"VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
(TO MAIDS)",887,"Chop chop! You cleany penthouseio!
Come on, Arthur. Have to pick
yourself up, lad. It's like when
Nixon my Great Dane had to be put
down. Frightful state for days. But
I pulled myself together."
888,ARTHUR,888,You're comparing Hobson to...a dog?
889,VIVIENNE,889,"Well, yes. A faithful, humble
companion who..."
890,ARTHUR,890,"Um, I think I'd like you to leave,
if that's okay. Now?"
891,VIVIENNE,891,"Remember who pays for this
apartment, Arthur. For everything!"
892,VIVIENNE (CONT'D),892,"You had damn well better be at that
wedding, boy."
893,ARTHUR,893,"Don't worry. If I'm going to drink
myself to death I'll need
resources. Bye Vivienne..."
894,VIVIENNE,894,It's mother!
895,ARTHUR,895,My mother's dead.

this."

button. Milk in refrigerator;

someone. All my deepest, fondest
love, my dearest boy. I'm smiling
down at you - or more likely, up at
you - forever and ever, H xxxxxxxx."
903,(PAUSE),903,100.
904,BURT,904,"I just want you to know, if he
doesn't show up for this wedding, I
can't know what I'll do."
905,VIVIENNE,905,"Don't worry, Burt. He's cleaned
himself up. He's stopped drinking,
he's anxious to get a real job.
He's become a responsible citizen."
906,NAOMI,906,"Due to a tragic error in the
architect's drawing, the original

get the courage to come here and

(WAVES LEAFLET)",973,"It says here `ask about your
personalised tours'. I want the
personalised tour. To St. John the
Divine!
ALL OTHER TOURISTS
So do I! St. John the Divine, St.
John the Divine, St. John the...
108."
974,NAOMI,974,Okay!
975,ARTHUR,975,Ah! I'm trying to get to...
976,MANAGER,976,Hey!
977,"POLICEMAN
(INTO MIC)",977,"Uh, unit 6J, we have reports of an
indecent exposure on a school bus."
978,"POLICEMAN
(INTO MIC)",978,109.
979,ARTHUR,979,"I'm not him.
(shows his wrists)
Look ma! No holes."
980,ARTHUR,980,"ARTHUR (O.S.)
Susan?"
981,SUSAN,981,Arthur? What's going on?
982,ARTHUR,982,Susan. I can't...I can't...
983,SUSAN,983,What?
984,ARTHUR,984,"The girl at the party? The one who
talked all that rubbish about
Coffee Mate? I love her."
985,SUSAN,985,Shut up! We're getting married!
986,ARTHUR,986,But I don't love you!
987,SUSAN,987,And you think I love you?
988,ARTHUR,988,"Well, yes. What's not to...
110."
989,SUSAN,989,I never have.
990,ARTHUR,990,"Susan, you're upset, you hate me.
It's okay. Now I'm sorry, I have to
go, or your dad's going to do
whatever he did to your boyfriend
from college."
991,SUSAN,991,"Daddy never hurt Alex. He paid her
parents to send her away.."
992,ARTHUR,992,HER? You're..a...
993,SUSAN,993,"Lesbian. Yes. You may have noticed
that daddy is homophobic. He swore
he'd disown me if it happened
again."
994,ARTHUR,994,But...why do you want to marry...
995,ARTHUR (CONT'D),995,Hang on. Am I your beard?
996,SUSAN,996,"Why else do you think I'd spend
more than 30 seconds in your
company? You're the perfect cover."
997,"ARTHUR
(REELING)",997,"Have you been pretending to like
Dane Cook as well?"
998,SUSAN,998,No.
999,ARTHUR,999,"Wow. Wow. Well. Uh...
(heads to the door)
Thanks for your honesty. I don't
feel so bad about calling this off."
1000,ARTHUR,1000,111.
1001,SUSAN,1001,"Arthur, please. You can drink as
much as you like, sneak off to
Naomi. We keep the money. We live
our lives. Everyone wins."
1002,ARTHUR,1002,"I may be a weak, pathetic drunk.
But I won't marry a lesbian Dane
Cook fan."
1003,ARTHUR,1003,"Good evening, St. John the Divine!
Anyone in from St. Patrick's?
Bialystoker Synagogue? Manhattan
Mosque? AA?"
1004,ARTHUR,1004,"...and the first turned to the
second horse and said `That dog
just spoke'."
1005,ARTHUR (CONT'D),1005,"The joke being that it's
inconsistent that the horses can
speak but the dog can't."
1006,ARTHUR (CONT'D),1006,"The wedding's off. The bride has
had second thoughts. I can't say I
blame her. Would you marry me?"
1007,(MORE),1007,112.
1008,"ARTHUR (CONT'D)
(PAUSE)",1008,"You won't be seeing me again, as
I'm going to be poor. I'll be
shopping at the 99 Cent Store. Six
pork chops for under a dollar!"
1009,ARTHUR (CONT'D),1009,"Great. I'm glad we had this talk.
I'll let you get on with the
wedding...."
1010,SUSAN,1010,"Daddy, no! Stop it!"
1011,VIVIENNE,1011,Burt! Get off my son!
1012,SUSAN,1012,"(louder than anyone yet)
DADDY!!!"
1013,BURT,1013,You wouldn't hurt me.
1014,SUSAN,1014,Wouldn't I? You crushed me.
1015,BURT,1015,I just wanted you to be happy.
1016,SUSAN,1016,"Bullshit. You wanted to stop me
being a lesbian!"
1017,BURT,1017,"Shut up! Shut up you dirty little
dyke harlot!
113."
1018,ERICA,1018,"You want some more, bitch? Huh?"
1019,SUSAN,1019,"Erica, that's enough, honey."
1020,ARTHUR,1020,"Why didn't you tell me? We could
have worked something out."
1021,ARTHUR (CONT'D),1021,I'm joking.
1022,ARTHUR,1022,"OW! Stop it! Why are you doing
that?"
1023,NAOMI,1023,"Because I hate an infection! Keep
still."
1024,ARTHUR,1024,"No, you keep still."
1025,NAOMI,1025,"What are we going to do, Arthur?"
1026,ARTHUR,1026,"I'll get a job. I'll model cheap
riding boots for people with no
horses. You can write books about
boys whose lungs have run away."
1027,VIVIENNE,1027,Stop this!
1028,VIVIENNE,1028,114.
1029,VIVIENNE (CONT'D),1029,"A Bach-Templemead has never been
poor and we're not about to try
that experiment with you, Arthur.
That said, you've shown strength of
character for once, instead of
blubbing on about frogs and
friendship. The inheritance is
yours. All I ask is, with Hobson
gone, you finally start treating me
like a mother."
1030,ARTHUR,1030,"Sorry, Vivienne. I can't do that."
1031,VIVIENNE,1031,I beg your pardon?
1032,ARTHUR,1032,"You've never earned that title. I
wouldn't fake it with Susan. I
won't with you."
1033,VIVIENNE,1033,"Arthur. I will withdraw this offer
forever. Don't doubt me, boy."
1034,ARTHUR,1034,I don't.
1035,ARTHUR (CONT'D),1035,"Take care, Viv."
1036,VIVIENNE,1036,"Arthur! Arthur! I am serious! If
you walk out of that door..."
1037,VIVIENNE,1037,115.
1038,ARTHUR,1038,"Sorry, Marty. This isn't mine any
more. Fancy joining us for a bowl
of Special J?"
1039,FADE OUT,1039,"ARTHUR (O.S.)
OW!"
1040,FADE OUT,1040,"ARTHUR (O.S.)
This is outrageous!"
1041,ARTHUR,1041,"Operational heat controls in a
shower are a basic human right!"
1042,ARTHUR,1042,"116.
ARTHUR (O.S.)
Owww! My eyes! I'm blind!"
1043,ARTHUR (CONT'D),1043,"What the hell's in this shampoo?
Napalm? It sure as hell isn't tea
tree oil..."
1044,RALPH,1044,"Package for you. With any luck an
apartment for you and Lurch."
1045,ARTHUR,1045,I thought you liked me.
1046,RALPH,1046,"I may have been seduced by money.
It happens."
1047,ARTHUR,1047,"(reading it out)
`Can I be your friend at least?
Love, Vivienne xxx. P.S. Lunch
sometime? P.P.S. The inheritance is
yours. It always was.'"
1048,RALPH,1048,"On balance, I'd go for it."
1049,MARTY,1049,Money good.
1050,NAOMI,1050,"You were never happy rich, honey.
It's only been a month. Be strong.
Remember: however hard life gets,
love will always find a way."
1051,(MORE),1051,117.
1052,NAOMI (CONT'D),1052,"(off their stares:)
What? Can't a girl make a joke?"
1053,ARTHUR,1053,"Brought her for moral support. But
I'll do the talking this time."
