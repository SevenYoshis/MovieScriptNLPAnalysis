this picture?"
1,LEADER,1,"Nice night for a walk, eh?"
2,TERMINATOR,2,Nice night for a walk.
3,SECOND PUNK,3,"Washday tomorrow, huh?  Nothing
clean, right?"
4,TERMINATOR,4,Nothing clean.  Right.
5,LEADER,5,"This guy's a couple bricks
short."
6,TERMINATOR,6,Your clothes.  Give them to me.
7,TERMINATOR,7,Now.
8,SECOND PUNK,8,"Fuck you, asshole."
9,DERELICT,9,"Say, buddy...did you see a
real bright light?"
10,FIRST COP,10,"Hold it, right there!"
11,REESE,11,What day is it?  The date...
12,COP,12,Thursday...uh...May twelfth.
13,REESE,13,What year?
14,SARAH,14,"Watch this for me, big buns."
15,BREEN (V.O.),15,Sarah?
16,SARAH,16,"Yes, Chuck?"
17,BREEN,17,"Come to the office, please."
18,SARAH,18,"Mission control to Chuck,
come in..."
19,BREEN,19,You're late.
20,SARAH,20,Aren't I worth waiting for?
21,BREEN,21,"Not really.  Do you think you
can get here on time if I put
you on the floor as a waitress?"
22,SARAH,22,"I don't know.  I kinda had
my heart set on being a
cashier the rest of my life."
23,BREEN,23,"The pay's the same but you'll
make more in tips."
24,SARAH,24,"Thanks, Chuck.  I need the
money.  Can I still work the
hours around my classes?"
25,BREEN,25,Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
26,SARAH,26,Alright!
27,BREEN,27,Can you handle it?
28,SARAH,28,"It's not brain surgery,
Chuck."
29,BREEN,29,"Here you go.  You're a
Bob's Girl now.  Nancy
will check you out."
30,SARAH,30,I won't let the fat kid down.
31,SARAH,31,"Hi, I'm Sarah and I'll be
you waitress."
32,SARAH,32,"I'm so wholesome, I could
puke."
33,TERMINATOR (V.O.),33,...the Remington 1100 Autoloader...
34,CLERK,34,Anything else?
35,TERMINATOR,35,"A phased plasma pulse-laser in
the forty watt range..."
36,CLERK,36,"Just what you see, pal."
37,TERMINATOR,37,The Uzi 9 millimeter.
38,CLERK,38,"You know your weapons, buddy."
39,CLERK,39,"Any one of them's ideal for
home defense. Which'll it be?"
40,TERMINATOR,40,All.
41,CLERK,41,"Maybe I'll close early.
Cash or charge?"
42,CLERK,42,"Sorry, I can't sell the ammo
with the guns.  You'll have
to---Hey!"
43,CLERK,43,You can't to that...
44,TERMINATOR,44,Wrong.
45,MAN,45,"Hey, man..."
46,CUSTOMER,46,"Honey, can I get that coffee
now?"
47,SARAH,47,"Yes sir, just a second."
48,SARAH,48,Who gets the Burly Burger?
49,CUSTOMER TWO,49,I ordered Barbecue Beef.
50,CUSTOMER THREE,50,Does mine come with fires?
51,CUSTOMER FOUR,51,"He's got the Barbecue Beef,
I've got a Chili-Beef Deluxe."
52,SARAH,52,"Okay, who gets the Burly Beef?"
53,CUSTOMER AT NEXT TABLE,53,"Miss, we're ready to order."
54,SARAH,54,"Oh, sorry.  That's not real
leather, is it?"
55,NANCY,55,"Look at it this way: in a
hundred years, who's gonna
care?"
56,TERMINATOR,56,Sarah Connor?
57,WOMAN,57,"No, she's upstairs.  Who
shall I say is--"
58,WOMAN,58,"What do you think you're--
My God!"
59,WOMAN,59,Oh my God...Sarah!
60,WRONG SARAH CONNOR,60,"What is it, Mom?"
61,TAKE-OUT CUSTOMER,61,"Gimme a falafel with yogurt
dressing and, uh, Baco-bits."
62,REESE,62,"Gimme a falafel with, uh,
yogurt and Baco-bits."
63,COUNTERMAN,63,That'll be one-sixty.
64,COUNTERMAN,64,Hey!  Son-of-a-bitch.
65,SARAH,65,"I haven't seen you in here
lately, Mr. Miller."
66,MR. MILLER,66,What's it to ya?
67,SARAH,67,You must have a girlfriend.
68,MR. MILLER,68,That's none of your business.
69,SARAH,69,Aha!  Is she young?
70,MR. MILLER,70,"Compared to me she is.  How
come you're not at the cash
anymore?  They catch ya steal-
ing?"
71,SARAH,71,What's it to ya?
72,SARAH,72,"I'm on break, Chuck.  Carla's
got my station."
73,NANCY,73,"Hurry up.  It's about you...
I mean sort of...Come on!"
74,WAITRESS,74,"Hey, Sarah.  This is weird."
75,TV ANCHORWOMAN,75,"...and a police spokesman at
the scene refused to speculate
on a motive for the execution-
style slaying of the Encino
housewife.  He did however say
that an accurate description of
the suspect has been compiled
from several witnesses.  Once
again, Sarah Connor, thirty-five,
mother of two, brutally shot to
death in her home this afternoon."
76,NANCY,76,"You're dead, honey."
77,MARCO,77,"Hi. I've seen you around.
You're cute.  Cute I remember."
78,SARAH,78,I'm Sarah.  Ginger's roommate.
79,MARCO,79,"Yeah, right.  I'm Marco."
80,GINGER,80,"...and three aaand four!  And
that's it ladies!  Now, didn't
that feel good?"
81,GINGER,81,"Let's think positive or next
time I'll play the FM version."
82,SARAH,82,"...yeah, really?  Say some-
thing in Italian."
83,GINGER,83,"You're wasting your time, kiddo.
Let's go."
84,SARAH,84,I don't believe you did that.
85,SARAH,85,"I had him hooked.  He was
just about to ask me out.
I could tell."
86,GINGER,86,"That guy's a jerk.  I did
you a favor."
87,SARAH,87,"I'll do the same for you
sometime."
88,GINGER,88,"You think somebody's gonna
do this for you?  Look at
those shriveled bi's.  And
you haven't worked lat's or
ab's since Wednesday."
89,MATT,89,"Hello, sweetheart.  Had a
rough day?"
90,GINGER,90,"Come here, wimp."
91,SARAH,91,"Hi, Matt."
92,MATT,92,"Heeey!  It's my favorite
Sarah.  Hi, babe."
93,GINGER,93,"Alright, warm-ups are over.
Back to work, Bunky."
94,MATT,94,"'Bye beautiful.  You too,
Ginger."
95,WEIGHTLIFTER,95,Bunky?
96,BOY,96,"Hey, mister...?"
97,SISTER,97,"See, I told you he wasn't
dead.  You owe me Baskin
Robbins."
98,BOY,98,Come on.  Just come on.
99,SARAH,99,Hello?
100,VOICE (V.O.),100,"First I'm going to rip the
buttons off your blouse, one
by one...then run my tongue
along your neck, down to your
bare, gleaming breasts..."
101,SARAH,101,Ginger!  It's Matt.
102,MATT (V.O.),102,"...and then slowly pull your
jeans off inch by inch and
lick your belly in circles,
further and further down...
then I'll pull off your panties
with my teeth..."
103,SARAH,103,Who is this?
104,MATT (V.O.),104,"Oh my God!  Sarah!  Oh, shit.
Jesus, I'm sorry.  I thought
you were...Can I talk to Ginger?"
105,SARAH,105,"Sure, Bunky."
106,GINGER,106,Hello?
107,MATT (V.O.),107,"First I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse..."
108,SARAH,108,What do you think?
109,GINGER,109,Great.
110,SARAH,110,How about this?
111,GINGER,111,Great.
112,SARAH,112,You're a big help.
113,GINGER,113,"Alright, the beige one."
114,SARAH,114,I hate the beige one.
115,GINGER,115,Don't wear the beige one.
116,SARAH (V.O.),116,"This guy's probably a schmuck
and I don't care what I wear."
117,SARAH,117,You think the beige?
118,VUKOVICH,118,Give me the short version.
119,TRAXLER,119,"Six shots at less than ten
feet.  Weapon was a large
caliber--"
120,VUKOVICH,120,No shit.
121,TRAXLER,121,"Come on. man.  Don't track
it all over.  It's un-
professional."
122,TRAXLER,122,"Okay, let's see...Got a pos-
itive on her.  She's Sarah
Connor, works as a legal--"
123,VUKOVICH,123,"That can't be right.  That's
the name of the one Valley
Division mopped up this after-
noon."
124,TRAXLER,124,Here's her driver's license.
125,VUKOVICH,125,"You gotta be kidding me.  The
new guys'll be short-stroking
it over this one.  A one-day
pattern killer."
126,TRAXLER,126,I hate the weird ones.
127,GINGER,127,Better than mortal man deserves.
128,SARAH,128,"Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?"
129,GINGER,129,"Not lately.  Did you check
messages?"
130,SARAH,130,I thought you did.
131,SARAH,131,"Come here young man.  Mind
your mother."
132,GINGER,132,Totally nauseating.
133,VOICE,133,"Hi, Sarah...Stan Morsky.
Uh, something's come up and
it looks like I won't be able
to make it tonight.  I'm really
sorry.  Call you in a day or so.
Sorry.  'Bye."
134,GINGER,134,"That bum.  So what if he has
a Porsche, he can't treat you
like that...it's Friday night
for crissakes."
135,SARAH,135,I'll live.
136,GINGER,136,I'll break his kneecaps.
137,SARAH,137,"You still love me, don't
you, Pugsley?"
138,SARAH,138,"I'm going to a movie, kiddo.
See ya'.  You and Matt have
a good time."
139,GINGER,139,"We will, kiddo."
140,REPORTER,140,"...Lieutenant, are you aware
that these two killings occurred
in the same order as their listings
in the phone book?"
141,VUKOVICH,141,No comment.
142,TRAXLER,142,That stuff's two hours cold.
143,VUKOVICH,143,I know.
144,TRAXLER,144,I put a cigarette out in it.
145,VUKOVICH,145,"Did you reach the next girl
yet?"
146,TRAXLER,146,"No.  Keep getting an answer-
ing machine."
147,VUKOVICH,147,Send a unit.
148,TRAXLER,148,"I already did.  No answer at
the door and the apartment
manager's out.  I'm keeping
them there."
149,VUKOVICH,149,Call her.
150,TRAXLER,150,I just called.
151,VUKOVICH,151,Call her again.
152,VUKOVICH,152,Got a cigarette?
153,GINGER'S VOICE,153,Hi there.
154,GINGER'S VOICE,154,"Ha ha ha, fooled you. You're
talking to a machine, but don't
by shy, it's okay.  Machines need
love too, so talk to it and Ginger,
that's me, or Sarah will get back
to you.  Wait for the beep."
155,TRAXLER,155,Same shit.
156,VUKOVICH,156,"I can hear it now, it's gonna
be the goddamned 'Phone Book
Killer'."
157,TRAXLER,157,"I hate the press cases.
Especially the weird press
cases.  Where you going?"
158,VUKOVICH,158,"To make a statement. I'm gonna
give them the name.  Maybe the
jackals can help us out for
once."
159,VUKOVICH,159,"If they can get this on the
tube by eleven, she may just
call us."
160,VUKOVICH,160,How do I look?
161,TRAXLER,161,"Like shit, boss."
162,ANCHORMAN (V.O.),162,"...police had no further comment
on the apparent similarity between
the shooting death of an Encino
woman earlier today..."
163,ANCHORMAN (V.O.),163,"...and this almost identical
killing two hours ago of a
Venice resident with virtually
the same name.  Sarah Ann Connor,
a 24 year old legal secretary, was
pronounced dead at the scene in
her beachfront apartment..."
164,CUSTOMER,164,"Hey, can we change this and
catch the ball scores."
165,BARTENDER,165,Sure.
166,SARAH,166,Leave it where it is!
167,ANCHORMAN (V.O.),167,"...no other connections between
the two victims has been estab-
lished."
168,ANCHORMAN (V.O.),168,"On a lighter note, these was
cause for celebration at the
L.A. Zoo today, as..."
169,VOICE (V.O./RECORDED),169,"You have reached the Los Angeles
Police Department Emergency Number.
All lines are busy.  If you need
a police car sent out to you, please
stay on the line..."
170,DISPATCHER (V.O.),170,"...two eleven in progress at
Seven-Eleven market, Third and
Tamarac.  One suspect believed
to be armed..."
171,GINGER,171,"Shoo.  Go on.  I'll make a
belt out of you."
172,MATT,172,Whoah!
173,GINGER'S VOICE,173,Hi there.
174,GINGER'S VOICE,174,"Ha ha ha, fooled you.  You're
talking to a machine..."
175,GINGER'S VOICE,175,"...but don't be shy, it's okay.
Machines need love too..."
176,GINGER'S VOICE,176,"...so talk to it and Ginger, that's
me, or Sarah will get back to you.
Wait for the beep."
177,SARAH'S VOICE,177,"Ginger, this is Sarah..."
178,SARAH'S VOICE,178,"...I'm in this sleazy bar called
Stoker's on Pico but I'm too
scared to leave.  I'm really
scared, kiddo..."
179,SARAH,179,"...I think somebody's after me
and I sure hope you play this
soon 'cause I need you and Matt
to come pick me up.  The police
keep transferring me around, but
I'm going to try them again."
180,SARAH,180,"The number here is 468-9175.
Call me, kiddo.  I need you.
It's Stoker's on Pico. Bye."
181,SARAH,181,"...look, Lieutenant...uh,
Vukovich, don't put me on
hold and don't transfer me
to another department..."
182,VUKOVICH,182,"I won't.  Now just relax.
Where are you?"
183,VUKOVICH,183,"Yeah, I know it...on Pico.
Are you alright?"
184,SARAH,184,"Yes, but I don't want to
leave.  I think this guy's
following me."
185,VUKOVICH,185,"Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen
carefully.  You're in a public
place, you'll be safe 'til we
get there.  Stay visible.
Don't go outside or in the
restroom.  I'll be there in
a few minutes."
186,VUKOVICH,186,Let's roll.
187,VUKOVICH,187,"Let's see how this guy likes
playing hard-ball."
188,WAITRESS,188,Anything else?
189,SARAH,189,Lieutenant Vukovich?
190,REESE,190,"Come with me if you want
to live."
191,SARAH,191,Oh my God...
192,VUKOVICH,192,What the fuck is going on?
193,VUKOVICH,193,Cover the alley in back.
194,VUKOVICH,194,Go!  Go!  He's got her.
195,TRAXLER,195,"Suspect westbound on
Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has
hostage, repeat..."
196,REESE,196,Hold on.
197,REESE,197,"Are you injured?  Are you
shot?"
198,REESE,198,"Do exactly what I say.
Exactly.  Don't move un-
less I say.  Don't make a
sound unless I say.  Do
you understand?"
199,REESE,199,Do you understand?
200,SARAH,200,Yes.  Don't hurt me.
201,REESE,201,"I'm here to help you.  Reese,
Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416..."
202,REESE,202,"Assigned to protect you.
You've been targetted for
termination."
203,COP,203,"...I don't know, it looks
like it might spread to this
furniture warehouse across
the alley, the paint on the
wall's starting to blister
up..."
204,COP,204,"Better get another truck
round to this side."
205,SARAH,205,"This is a mistake.  I haven't
done anything."
206,REESE,206,"No. But you will.  It's
very important that you
live."
207,SARAH,207,"I can't believe this is happen-
ing.  How could than man get up
after you..."
208,REESE,208,"Not a man.  A Terminator.
Cyber Dynamics Model 101."
209,DISPATCHER (V.O.),209,"...Suspect vehicle sighted on
Motor at Pico, southbound.
Units Two-Zero-Six and Five-
Seven, attempt intercept.
Unit One-Four-Three, come in."
210,TERMINATOR,210,"This is One-Four-Three.  West-
bound on Olympic, approaching
Overland."
211,PILOT (V.O.),211,"Air-unit Two.  We're on him.
Westbound Santa Monica at 405."
212,SARAH,212,"A machine?  You mean, like
a robot?"
213,REESE,213,"Not a robot.  Cyborg.
Cybernetic Organism."
214,SARAH,214,But...he was bleeding.
215,REESE,215,"Just a second.  Keep your
head down."
216,PILOT (V.O.),216,Lost him.
217,REESE,217,Good cover.
218,REESE,218,"Alright.  Listen.
The Terminator's an infil-
tration unit.  Part man, part
machine.  Underneath, it's a
hyperalloy combat chassis,
mircoprocessor-controlled,
fully  armored. Very tough..."
219,REESE,219,"But outside, it's living
human tissue.  Flesh, skin,
hair...blood.  Grown for the
cyborgs."
220,SARAH,220,"Look, Reese, I know you want
to help, but..."
221,REESE,221,"Pay attention.  The 600
series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.  But
these are new.  They look
human.  Sweat, bad breath,
everything.  Very hard to
spot.  I had to wait 'til
he moved on you before I
could zero him."
222,SARAH,222,"Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know.
They can't build anything like
that yet."
223,REESE,223,"No.  Not yet.  Not for about
forty years."
224,SARAH,224,"So, it's from the future, is
that right?"
225,REESE,225,"One possible future.  Four your
point of view.  I don't know the
tech stuff."
226,SARAH,226,And you're from the future too?
227,REESE,227,Right.
228,SARAH,228,Right...
229,REESE,229,"Cyborgs don't feel pain.  I
do.  Don't...do that...again."
230,SARAH,230,Just let me go.
231,REESE,231,"Listen.  Understand.  That
Terminator is out there.  It
can't be reasoned with, it can't
be bargained with...it doesn't
feel pity of remorse or fear...
and it absolutely will not stop.
Ever.  Until you are dead."
232,SARAH,232,Can you stop it?
233,REESE,233,"Maybe.  With these weapons...
I don't know."
234,DISPATCHER (V.O.),234,"Suspect vehicle located at
parking lot, Cedar and Glen-
haven..."
235,SARAH,235,"Reese...why me?  Why does
it want me?"
236,REESE,236,There's so much...
237,SARAH,237,"Tell me.  Just start at the
beginning."
238,REESE,238,"There was a war.  A few years
from now.  Nuclear war.  The
whole thing.  All this--"
239,REESE,239,"--everythingis gone.  Just
gone.  There were survivors.
Here.  There.  Nobody knew who
started it."
240,REESE,240,It was the machines.
241,SARAH,241,I don't understand...
242,REESE,242,"Defense network computer. New.
Powerful.  Hooked into everything.
Trusted to run it all.  They say it
got smart...a new order of intelli-
gence.  Then it saw all people as
a threat, not just the ones on the
other side.  Decided out fate in a
microsecond...extermination."
243,REESE,243,"Didn't see the war.  I was born
after, in the ruins.  Grew up
there.  Starving.  Hiding from
the H-K's."
244,SARAH,244,The what?
245,REESE,245,"Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines.
Build in automated factories.
Most of us were rounded up, put in
camps...for orderly disposal."
246,REESE,246,Burned in by laser scan.
247,REESE,247,"Some of us were kept alive...
to work.  Loading bodies.  The
disposal units ran night and day.
We were that close to going out
forever..."
248,REESE,248,"...but there was one man...who
taught us to fight.  To storm
the wire of the camps.  To
smash those metal mother-
fuckers into junk.  He turned
it around...he brought us back
from the brink."
249,REESE,249,"His name is Connor.  John Connor...
your son, Sarah.  Your unborn son."
250,REESE,250,Steer!
251,SARAH,251,Reese!
252,VUKOVICH,252,"Here, drink some of this..."
253,SARAH,253,"Lieutenant, are you sure it's
them?  Maybe I should see the
...bodies."
254,VUKOVICH,254,"They've already been identi-
fied.  There's no doubt."
255,SARAH,255,"Of, God...Ginger...kiddo,
I'm so sorry."
256,VUKOVICH,256,Sarah.
257,VUKOVICH,257,"Sarah, this is Dr. Silber-
man.  I'd like you to tell
him everything Reese said
to you.  Do you feel up to it?"
258,SARAH,258,I guess so.
259,SARAH,259,You're a doctor?
260,SILBERMAN,260,A criminal psychologist.
261,SARAH,261,Is Reese crazy?
262,SILBERMAN,262,"That's what we're going to
find out."
263,SILBERMAN,263,"So.  You're a soldier.
Fighting for whom?"
264,REESE,264,"With the One Thirty Second
under Perry, from '21 to '27--"
265,SILBERMAN,265,The year 2027?
266,REESE,266,That's right.
267,TRAXLER,267,This is fucking great.
268,REESE,268,"Then I was assigned Recon/
Security, last two years,
under John Connor."
269,SILBERMAN,269,And who was the enemy?
270,REESE,270,"SKYNET.  A computer defense system
built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber
Dynamics.  A modified Series
4800."
271,SILBERMAN,271,"I see.  And this...computer,
thinks it can win by killing
the mother of its enemy, kill-
ing him, in effect, before he
is even conceived?  A sort of
retroactive abortion?"
272,REESE,272,Yes.
273,TRAXLER,273,That Silberman just crack me up.
274,TRAXLER,274,"He had this guy in here last week
who set his Afghan on fire.
Screwed it first, then set it on--"
275,VUKOVICH,275,Shut up.
276,REESE,276,"...it had no choice.
The defensive grid was
smashed. We'd taken the
mainframes...
We'd won.  Taking out
Connor then would make no
difference.  Skynet had to
wipe out his entire exist-
ence.  We captured the lab
complex.  Found the...what-
ever it was called...the
time-displacement equipment.
The Terminator had already
gone through.  They sent two
of us to intercept, then
zeroed the whole place.
Sumner didn't make it."
277,SILBERMAN,277,"Then how are you supposed to
get back?"
278,REESE,278,"Can't.  Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.
It's just him and me."
279,REESE,279,...It's just him and me.
280,SILBERMAN,280,"Why didn't you bring any
weapons?  Something more
advanced.  Don't you have
ray guns?"
281,SILBERMAN,281,"Show me a piece of future
technology."
282,REESE,282,"You go naked.  Something about
the field generated by a living
organism.  Nothing dead will go."
283,SILBERMAN,283,Why?
284,REESE,284,"I didn't build the fucking
thing."
285,SILBERMAN,285,Okay.  Okay.  But this...
286,SILBERMAN,286,cyborg...if it's metal...
287,REESE,287,Surrounded by living tissue.
288,SILBERMAN,288,Of course.
289,SILBERMAN,289,"This is great stuff.  I could
make a career out of this guy.
You see how clever this part
is...how it doesn't require a
shred of proof.  Most paranoid
delusions are intricate...but
this is brilliant."
290,SILBERMAN,290,"Why were the other two women
killed?"
291,REESE,291,"Most official records were
lost in the war.  The computer
knew almost nothing about
Connor's mother.  Her name.
Where she lived, just the city.
No scanner pictures.  The
Terminator was just being
systematic."
292,REESE,292,"You've heard enough.  Decide.
Are you going to release me?"
293,SILBERMAN,293,"I'm afraid that's not up
to me."
294,REESE,294,"Then why am I talking to you?
Get out."
295,SILBERMAN,295,I can help you...
296,REESE,296,Who is in authority here?
297,REESE,297,"You still don't get it.
He'll find her.  That's
what he does.  All he does..."
298,REESE,298,"You can't stop him. He'll
wade through you..."
299,REESE,299,"...reach down her throat, and
pull her fucking heart out..."
300,SILBERMAN,300,Sorry.
301,SARAH,301,So Reese is crazy.
302,SILBERMAN,302,"In technical terminology,
he's a loon."
303,SARAH,303,But...
304,VUKOVICH,304,"Sarah, this is body armor.
Out TAC guys wear it.  It'll
stop a 12 gauge round.  This
other individual must've had
one under his coat."
305,SARAH,305,"But what about him punching
through the windshield?"
306,TRAXLER,306,"Probably on PCP, broke every
bone in his hand and won't feel
it for hours.  There was this
guy once that..."
307,VUKOVICH,307,"Why don't you just stretch out
here and get some sleep.  It'll
take your mom a good hour to get
here from Redlands."
308,SARAH,308,I can't sleep.
309,VUKOVICH,309,"Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're
thirty cops in this building."
310,SARAH,310,Okay.
311,TRAXLER,311,What?
312,TRAXLER,312,"Ed, come on...the guy's a
wacko."
313,VUKOVICH,313,He'd better be.
314,TERMINATOR,314,"I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she is here.  Can
I see her, please?"
315,SERGEANT,315,"You can't see here.  She's
making a statement."
316,TERMINATOR,316,Where is she?
317,SERGEANT,317,"Look.  It's gonna be a while.
You wanna wait.  There's a
bench."
318,TERMINATOR,318,I'll come back.
319,VUKOVICH,319,Stay here.
320,TRAXLER,320,Watch him.
321,TRAXLER,321,Ed!  Ed...?
322,REESE (V.O.),322,Sarah?
323,VUKOVICH (V.O.),323,Reese!
324,VUKOVICH,324,"You just keep her alive.  Do
what you have to."
325,REESE,325,Let's get off the road.
326,REESE,326,You cold?
327,SARAH,327,Freezing.
328,REESE,328,Come here.
329,SARAH,329,Reese...you got a first name?
330,REESE,330,Kyle.
331,SARAH,331,"Kyle, what's it like when you
go through time?"
332,REESE,332,"White light.  Pain.  Like
being ripped inside out...
slowly.  Like being born,
maybe."
333,SARAH,333,You're wet.  Oh my god.
334,REESE,334,"I caught one, back there."
335,SARAH,335,"Caught one?  You mean you
got shot?"
336,REESE,336,It's not bad.
337,SARAH,337,We gotta get you to a doctor.
338,REESE,338,It's okay.  Forget it.
339,SARAH,339,"Forget it?  Are you crazy?
Let me see it."
340,SARAH,340,"Jeez.  You idiot.  Take
this off."
341,REESE,341,"See.  Missed everything.
Passed through the meat."
342,SARAH,342,"This is gonna make me puke.
Talk about something."
343,REESE,343,What?
344,SARAH,344,"Just talk.  Tell me about
my son.  Is he tall?"
345,REESE,345,"About my height.  He
has your--"
346,REESE,346,"...damn...he has your
eyes."
347,SARAH,347,What's he like?
348,REESE,348,"You trust him.  He's got that
strength.  You'd die in a
second for John."
349,SARAH,349,"Well, at least I know what
to name him.  I don't suppose
you'd know who the father is?
So I don't tell him to get
lost when I meet him."
350,REESE,350,"John never said much about
him.  He dies.  Even before
the war..."
351,SARAH,351,"Stop!  I don't want to know.
Hold still.  So...it was John
that ordered you here?"
352,REESE,352,I volunteered.
353,SARAH,353,You volunteered?
354,REESE,354,"It was an honor.  A chance
to meet the legend.  Sarah
Connor.  Who taught her son
to fight...organize, prepare.
From when he was a kid.  When
you were in hiding, before
the war."
355,SARAH,355,"You talk about things I haven't
done yet in the past tense.  It's
making me crazy.  I can't think."
356,SARAH,356,"Are you sure you've got the
right person?"
357,REESE,357,I'm sure.
358,SARAH,358,"Come on, me? The mother
of the future?  Am I tough?
Organized?  I can't even balance
my checkbook.  I cry when I see
a cat that's been run over...
and I don't even like cats."
359,REESE,359,"Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's
better tight."
360,SARAH,360,"And anyway, what do I know
about guerrilla warfare?"
361,REESE,361,You'll learn.
362,SARAH,362,"Look, Reese, I didn't ask for
this honor and I don't want it.
Any of it."
363,REESE,363,"John gave me a message for
you.  Made me memorize it.
'Sarah""...this is the message...
'Sarah, thank you.  For your
courage through the dark years.
I can't help you with what you
must soon face, except to tell
you that the future is not set...
there is no such thing as Fate,
but what we make for ourselves
by our own will.  You must be
stronger than you imagine you
can be.  You must survive, or I
will never exist.'  That's all."
364,REESE,364,Good field-dressing.
365,SARAH,365,You like it?  It's my first.
366,REESE,366,Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
367,SARAH,367,Okay.  Talk some more.
368,REESE,368,About what?
369,SARAH,369,About where you're from.
370,REESE,370,Alright.
371,REESE,371,"You stay down by day, but at
night you can move around.
The H-K's use infra-red so you
still have to watch out.
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them
them.  That's when the infiltra-
tors started to appear.  The
Terminators were the newest,
the worst..."
372,SENTRY,372,Terminator!
373,SARAH,373,I was dreaming about dogs.
374,REESE,374,We used them to spot Terminators.
375,SARAH,375,"Your world...it's pretty
terrifying."
376,SARAH,376,Put that away.  I'll get one.
377,SARAH,377,This works...really.
378,DRIVER,378,"...and when it breaks right
off the point they get some
pretty rad tubes up there.
Not awesome, but I mean, worth
the drive, if you're hardcore
like me."
379,REESE,379,Rad tubes?
380,SARAH,380,He's a surfer.
381,DRIVER,381,"You from back East of
something?"
382,SARAH,382,"No, he's from the future."
383,DRIVER,383,Whoah.  I hear that.
384,DRIVER,384,"Listen, I had a rough
night.  I gotta stop and
bag some Z's."
385,DRIVER,385,"You can still ride if
you wanna hang out for a
couple hours."
386,SARAH,386,Thanks.
387,REESE,387,Bag some Z's?
388,SARAH,388,"Let's get cleaned up, Kyle."
389,REESE,389,Yours is over there.
390,LITTLE GIRL (V.O.),390,Can you get my balloon?
391,REESE,391,"Aren't you afraid to be out in
the open like this?"
392,LITTLE GIRL,392,Huh?
393,SARAH,393,"...I know, Mom.  This is the
soonest I could...I know.
Mom...Mom, I can't talk long.
No, I'm okay."
394,SARAH,394,I was on TV?  Really?
395,SARAH,395,"Oh no, I hate that picture...
why didn't you give them my
graduation picture?"
396,SARAH,396,"I'm okay, really.  Listen, I
want you to pack some stuff
and go up to the cabin for a
few days.  Just don't...no,
don't ask any questions.
Just do it.  I gotta get
going...gotta go.  Bye, bye."
397,SARAH,397,Thanks a lot.
398,REESE (V.O.),398,What's that?
399,SARAH,399,That's where we're going.
400,REESE,400,Why?
401,SARAH,401,"Look.  I found it.  Isn't
that it?  Cyber Dynamics
Corporation?"
402,REESE,402,What about it?
403,SARAH,403,"Didn't you say that they're
going to develop this
revolutionary new thing..."
404,REESE,404,Molecular-memory.
405,SARAH,405,"Whatever...they become the
hotshot computer guys so they
get the job to build El Computer
Grande...Skynet...for the
government.  Right?"
406,REESE,406,"That's the way it was told
to me."
407,SARAH,407,"Well, we're gonna uninvent the
bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll
blow up the place...burn it
down.  Something."
408,REESE,408,"Tactically dangerous.  We
lay low."
409,SARAH,409,"Reese.  Think it through.
We can prevent the war.
Nobody else is gonna do it.
If we go to anybody official
we wind up back in jail and
then that walking cuisinart
has got us again.  We have to
so it ourselves."
410,REESE,410,That's not my mission.
411,SARAH,411,"Listen.  Understand.  I'm
not a military objective,
Reese.  I'm a person...
You don't own me."
412,REESE,412,Let's go.  Time to move out.
413,SARAH,413,Fuck you!  Let go of me!
414,REESE,414,Sarah!
415,SARAH,415,Let...go...bastard...
416,SARAH,416,"Oh, that's real smart.
Go on, shoot me. That's
brilliant."
417,SARAH,417,"Jesus Christ, Reese.  Can't
you see I'm scared?"
418,SARAH,418,"I can't spend my life waiting
for that thing to catch up
with me...always looking over
my shoulder, wondering if I
left some tiny clue behind..."
419,SARAH,419,Reese?
420,SARAH,420,Kyle?
421,REESE,421,"I'm wrong here.  I wasn't
meant to see this..."
422,REESE,422,"It's...like some dream.
This...this..."
423,REESE,423,"...and you...all so...beauti-
ful.  It hurts, Sarah.  More
than death."
424,REESE,424,"Don't you understand...it's
all gone!"
425,SARAH,425,"We can change it, Kyle.  We
have to try."
426,SARAH,426,"There's no fate but what we
make for ourselves. Right?
Come on.  Let's go, kiddo.
Whaddya say?"
427,MAN,427,"Hey, buddy, you got a
dead cat in there of what?"
428,TERMINATOR,428,"Fuck you, asshole."
429,REESE,429,Is this enough?
430,SARAH,430,"Yes.  And I don't want to
know where you got it."
431,SARAH,431,"We need a room...with a
kitchen."
432,SARAH,432,"I'm dying for a shower.  You
could use one too.  And we'd
better check that bandage."
433,REESE,433,"Later.  I'm going out for
materiel.  Keep this."
434,SARAH,434,"...No, Mom, I can't tell you
where I am.  I was told not
to say."
435,SARAH'S MOM (V.O.),435,"But honey, I need to know where
I can reach you or I'll be
worried sick.  It turns out I
can't stay up here...the
electricity's off...and I don't
know just where I'll be."
436,SARAH,436,"Okay, here's the number.  Are
you ready?"
437,SARAH'S MOM (V.O.),437,Go ahead.
438,SARAH (V.O.),438,It's 408-972-1439.  Room 14.
439,SARAH'S MOM (V.O.),439,I got it.
440,SARAH (V.O.),440,"Okay, I've gotta go.  I'm
sorry I can't tell you very
much now, Mom.  I love you."
441,TERMINATOR (MOTHER'S VOICE),441,"I love you too, sweetheart."
442,TERMINATOR (HIS VOICE),442,Hello.
443,TERMINATOR (HIS VOICE),443,Tell me your address there.
444,SARAH,444,"Let's see.  Corn syrup.
Ammonia.  Moth balls...
Mmm.  What's for dinner?"
445,REESE,445,Plastique.
446,SARAH,446,What's that?
447,REESE,447,"Nitroglycerin, basically.
Bit more stable.  I learned
howto make it when I was a
kid."
448,REESE,448,"Make sure there's none on the
threads, like this.  Now screw
the end-cap on...very gently."
449,SARAH,449,"You must have had a fun child-
hood."
450,REESE,450,"That's good.  Now, seven more
like that while I make fuses."
451,SARAH,451,"I was thinking, there's so
much I've got to show you
when we get through this.
It's mind boggling, the pos-
sibilities...Disneyland, the
beach, movies...matinees with
popcorn and foot-long hot dogs..."
452,REESE,452,Hot dogs?
453,SARAH,453,"I want to buy you a hot dog so
bad,Kyle...all the things you've
never seen and done.  You're here,
but wherever you go, and whatever
you touch, you bring the war with
you."
454,REESE,454,My whole life has been combat.
455,SARAH,455,I want it to be over for you.
456,REESE,456,Not possible.
457,SARAH,457,"I want it to be over for me too.
I feel like I slipped over some
invisible line, that I'm in your
world now.  Everything's the same,
but I see it differently.
It's like, there's you and me,
and him...but nobody else can
understand or help or even touch
us."
458,REESE,458,"We'll head out at 0200.
That gives you four hours
to sleep if you want.  I'll
finish."
459,SARAH,459,"He'll find us, won't he?"
460,REESE,460,"Probably.  Sarah, if I get
zeroed..."
461,SARAH,461,Don't say that.
462,REESE,462,"If I do, you have to get away,
disappear without a trace.
Different country, different
name, everything.  In case they
send another one."
463,SARAH,463,"It'll never be over, will it?
Look at me, I'm shaking.
Some legend, huh?  You must
be pretty disappointed."
464,REESE,464,No.  I'm not.
465,SARAH,465,"Kyle, the women in your
time...what were they like?"
466,REESE,466,Good fighters.
467,SARAH,467,"That's not what I meant.
Was there someone special?"
468,REESE,468,Someone?
469,SARAH,469,A girl.  You know.
470,REESE,470,No.
471,REESE,471,Never.
472,SARAH,472,I'm sorry.
473,SARAH,473,So much pain.
474,REESE,474,"Pain can be controlled.
You disconnect it."
475,SARAH,475,And so you feel nothing.
476,REESE,476,It's better that way.
477,SARAH,477,"Oh, Kyle."
478,REESE,478,"John Connor gave me a picture
of you once.  I never knew
why.  It was very old. Torn.
Faded.  You were young, like
you are now.  You weren't
smiling...just a little sad...
I always wondered what you
were thinking at that second."
479,REESE,479,"I memorized every line, every
curve..."
480,REESE,480,"Sarah, I came across time
for you.  I love you.
I always have."
481,REESE,481,"I'm sorry.  I shouldn't
have said..."
482,SARAH,482,Kyle...
483,SARAH,483,I bet you're ticklish.
484,REESE,484,Ticklish?
485,REESE,485,What are you doing?
486,SARAH,486,"You'll beg for mercy in
a second."
487,REESE,487,I don't think I like this.
488,SARAH,488,You're not supposed to.
489,REESE,489,Listen to the dogs.
490,REESE,490,Light it now.
491,RIDER,491,"Don't try to move, buddy."
492,REESE,492,Switch places with me.
493,SARAH,493,Kyle...oh God...
494,SARAH,494,Alriiight!
495,PARTNER,495,Don't stop.
496,DRIVER.,496,"I have to, man."
497,SARAH,497,"Come on, come on, come on
...run, you..."
498,SARAH,498,"Hold on real tight, okay?"
499,SARAH,499,"Hold on, goddamnit!"
500,REESE,500,Sarah.
501,SARAH,501,"We did it, Kyle.  We got it."
502,SARAH,502,What are you doing?
503,REESE,503,Cover...our footsteps...
504,REESE,504,Leave me here.
505,SARAH,505,"I'm not leaving you anywhere
you jerk.  Haven't you figured
it out?  Kyle, John is our
son."
506,SARAH,506,"There isn't going to be
anybody else...I don't want
anybody else.  Listen to
me!"
507,SARAH,507,"Move!  Reese! Let's go.
Move you ass!"
508,SARAH,508,Come on!
509,REESE,509,Run!
510,REESE,510,"Run, damn it!"
511,SARAH,511,You're...terminated...fucker!
512,COP,512,"Look, I told you not to
touch anything until we're
done.  You got that?"
513,MANAGER,513,"Sure thing, officer."
514,ASSISTANT,514,What is it?
515,MANAGER,515,"Microcomputer chassis.  But
I've never seen stuff like
this anywhere."
516,ASSISTANT,516,"Weird.  Jap stuff, maybe?"
517,MANAGER,517,"Keep it out of sight and
get it down to R and D
Monday, first thing."
518,ASSISTANT,518,Good idea.
519,SARAH (V.O.),519,"...and the hardest thing is
deciding what I should tell
you and what not to.  Well,
anyway, I've got a while yet
before you're old enough to
understand the tapes.  They're
more for me at this point...
to help get it all straight."
520,SARAH,520,"Should I tell you about your
father?  That's a tough one.
Will it change your decision
to send him here...knowing?
But if you don't send Kyle,
you could never be.  God,
you can go crazy thinking
about all this...I suppose
I'll tell you...I owe him that.
And maybe it'll be enough if
you know that in the few hours
we had together we loved a
lifetime's worth..."
521,ATTENDANT,521,"He says you are very beautiful,
Senora, and he is ashamed to ask
five American dollars for this
picture, but if he does not,
his father will beat him."
522,SARAH,522,"That's a pretty good hustle,
kid.  Four.  Quatro."
523,ATTENDANT,523,"Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars
American."
524,SARAH,524,What did he say?
525,ATTENDANT,525,There is a storm coming in.
526,SARAH,526,I know.
