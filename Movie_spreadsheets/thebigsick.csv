0,ANDY DODD (V.O.),0,"Give it up for my man, Mr. Kumail
Nanjiani!"
1,KUMAIL (V.O.),1,"Hello. I grew up in Pakistan. And people
are always asking me, what was that like?
Really not that different from here. I
mean we played cricket, which is just a
spicier version of baseball. And we
prayed a lot. Well not a lot, just five
times a day. And we marry someone our
parents find for us. Arranged marriage,
you know. For me, it was probably that we
got episodes of the A-Team a little bit
later. And by a little bit later, I mean
we just got episode two. But other than
that, it was exactly the same."
2,CHRIS,2,"There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad
comedians."
3,KUMAIL,3,"You complain about the crowd like all
the time."
4,CHRIS,4,"Yeah, but that's when they're really bad."
5,KUMAIL,5,"So like ninety percent of the time,
they're really bad?"
6,CHRIS,6,"Will you just watch and give me notes
tonight? If we both give each other
notes, I think it would be helpful."
7,KUMAIL,7,"Your notes are just to add more ""fucks""
into the bit."
8,CHRIS,8,"Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and
it's hard on the end."
9,MARY,9,That was truly horrible.
10,KUMAIL,10,"Hey, that was great."
11,MARY,11,"No, he didn't even crack a smile. I
thought I was gonna puke."
12,CHRIS,12,Who?
13,MARY,13,Bob Dalavan.
14,CHRIS,14,Who's Bob Dalaban?
15,CJ,15,"Bob Dalavan - works for the Montreal
Comedy Festival, you fuckin' doof.
Don't you want to get noticed? Move to
LA? Hang out with Elijah Wood and shit."
16,DODD,16,No one's on stage?
17,MARY,17,No!
18,KUMAIL,18,He might have been doing cocaine.
19,CJ,19,Was he doing cocaine recreationally?
20,MARY,20,A true cokehead.
21,DODD (O.S.),21,"Now before I bring up the next guy, you
guys know tonight is Jell-o Shot
Tuesday! Whooo!! And we all know what
happens after eight Jell-o shots. We
urinate all over ourselves and puke.
Okay, so I'm going to bring up the next
comic. You know this man."
22,CHRIS,22,Confidence. Poise. Smile.
23,Dodd (O.S.),23,Give it up for Mister Chris Jones!
24,KUMAIL,24,"He's like if a serial killer fucked an
inspirational speaker."
25,CJ,25,"He's like Daniel Day Lewis except he
sucks."
26,CHRIS,26,"Just bought a laser printer. Printed
out like six lasers so far."
27,KUMAIL,27,"Hey Dodd. Dalavan's in the crowd
tonight. Could I do ten?"
28,DODD,28,"No. Five minutes. You put out chairs,
you get five minutes. You know the
deal."
29,KUMAIL,29,C'mon man. I'll double it up next time.
30,DODD,30,No.
31,KUMAIL,31,What are you gonna do in there?
32,DODD,32,I'm making up next week's schedule.
33,KUMAIL,33,Okay. Cool.
34,CJ,34,"I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was
trying to mansplain to her that, you
know, we are on one little rock orbiting
a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in
a universe full of a billion galaxies, so
I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit?
You are cosmically over reacting to this.
Honestly you are being super selfish.
You're right, but you're selfish."
35,KUMAIL,35,"Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug
cocktail called cheese? I saw these news
reports so I looked up what cheese is and
cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM
and heroin. So really, it's heroin.
Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do
the heroin, it's very powerful. You
already have heroin."
36,KUMAIL (CONT'D),36,Is Pakistan in the house?!
37,KUMAIL (CONT'D),37,"You're not from Pakistan. I would have
noticed you."
38,CHRIS,38,"He just gave you Montreal? Like you
don't have to showcase or audition or
anything?"
39,CJ,39,"It was too easy. Like I wanted to
struggle. I wanted a story to be able
to tell on talk shows and instead,
like, you guys don't know how hard it
is not to struggle. It's a struggle
succeeding effortlessly."
40,MARY,40,Did he say anything about me?
41,CJ,41,Sure.
42,CHRIS,42,What about me?
43,CJ,43,"Both of you. He said, those guys
performed..."
44,MARY,44,"I truly hate you, actually."
45,CHRIS,45,We all hate you.
46,KUMAIL,46,Hi.
47,EMILY,47,Hi.
48,KUMAIL,48,"Um, my name is Kumail."
49,EMILY,49,Yeah. We know.
50,JESSIE,50,We saw you perform.
51,KUMAIL,51,"Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of
the way, I have to tell you that when
you yelled at me, it threw me off. You
really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's
so rude."
52,EMILY,52,"I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed
you. It was supportive."
53,KUMAIL,53,"Okay, that's a common misconception.
Yelling anything at a comedian is
considered heckling. Heckling doesn't
have to be negative."
54,EMILY,54,"So if I yelled out ""You're amazing in
bed,"" that would be a heckle?"
55,KUMAIL,55,Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.
56,JESSIE,56,Wow. Goodbye!
57,EMILY,57,Don't go! You scared my friend off now.
58,KUMAIL,58,What's your name?
59,EMILY,59,Emily.
60,KUMAIL,60,"I want to show you something, Emily.
This is your name in Urdu."
61,EMILY,61,Whoa. Does this move work?
62,KUMAIL,62,I've had some minor success with it.
63,EMILY,63,Bullshit.
64,KUMAIL,64,"So you came to a comedy show with your
friends?"
65,EMILY,65,"Yeah, we're all grad students at U of
C."
66,KUMAIL,66,What are you studying at grad school?
67,EMILY,67,"I study psychology. I'm going to be a
therapist."
68,KUMAIL,68,"Oh so you're gonna sit on a couch and
ask people, ""how did that make you
feel?"""
69,EMILY,69,"Eventually. Right now I'm doing field
work with a group of guys convicted of
domestic violence."
70,KUMAIL,70,Jesus.
71,EMILY,71,Cheers to that.
72,KUMAIL,72,"Oh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To
you becoming a therapist."
73,EMILY,73,"Great. To me getting my masters. We'll
start there and then we'll go to the
rest of it."
74,KUMAIL,74,"So my roommate Chris is probably on the
couch. He's going to try and start a
conversation. So no matter what- do not
engage. Okay? Let's go."
75,CHRIS,75,Hi!
76,CHRIS (CONT'D),76,Good for him.
77,KUMAIL,77,Do you want to watch a movie?
78,EMILY,78,"Sure. Should I just, put my stuff down?
Or..."
79,KUMAIL,79,"Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know
what, go for that area. I cleaned that
earlier this year."
80,EMILY,80,"Should I take my shoes off or is this a
shoes on bed?"
81,KUMAIL,81,"No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict
rules."
82,EMILY,82,"Oh wow. That's totally an inflated
mattress."
83,KUMAIL,83,"Yeah. Did you think it would be a flat
inflatable mattress?"
84,EMILY,84,"I did think it might be an actual
mattress."
85,KUMAIL,85,"Well air mattresses are actual
mattresses. You're being bigoted towards
air based comfort items."
86,KUMAIL (CONT'D),86,Night of The Living Dead?
87,EMILY,87,"Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie."
88,KUMAIL,88,"Okay, so basically the dead start rising.
And the good guys, um..."
89,CHRIS,89,Text Lauren. You up girl?
90,SIRI,90,What do you want to say to Warren?
91,CHRIS,91,"Ah, no. Fuck."
92,SIRI,92,What do you want to say to-
93,CHRIS,93,You up? Period. Send.
94,SIRI,94,"That may be beyond my abilities at the
moment."
95,CHRIS,95,Fuck.
96,EMILY,96,What are these scars?
97,KUMAIL,97,"Oh, they're a smallpox vaccination."
98,EMILY,98,I thought only old people had those.
99,KUMAIL,99,"Well I'm from Pakistan. We're still
fighting some battles you guys have
already won."
100,EMILY,100,"What were you like in high school? Were
you like, super funny? Were you really
smart?"
101,KUMAIL,101,"I was very shy. They called me
chashmullee."
102,EMILY,102,What is that?
103,KUMAIL,103,"It roughly translates to ""dweeb."" I'll
show you a picture."
104,EMILY,104,Of you in high school? Oh my god!
105,KUMAIL,105,Boom.
106,EMILY,106,No.
107,KUMAIL,107,"And I'm thinking I'm killing it right
now."
108,EMILY,108,What inspired this hair cut?
109,KUMAIL,109,Hugh Grant.
110,EMILY,110,Oh no. And you're so serious.
111,KUMAIL,111,"I read in an interview with Hugh Grant,
he said he doesn't smile because it
makes his face look fat. So I didn't
smile in pictures for many years. What
were you like in high school? Were you
voted... Most Sexy?"
112,EMILY,112,"No. I was voted ""Most Noticeable."""
113,KUMAIL,113,That's good.
114,EMILY,114,"No. It's really not good. I had acne,
and I was a Goth and I had this
terrible perm. The kids called me
Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually
I do know why, it's because they
thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I
think I'm done with this subject. In
fact, I think I'm gonna go home."
115,KUMAIL,115,Wait we haven't even had sex again yet.
116,EMILY,116,"No. No. I'm really not that kind of
girl. I only have sex once on a first
date. Plus a hand job."
117,KUMAIL,117,Well I haven't had that yet!
118,EMILY,118,"You don't get that because you made fun
of me."
119,KUMAIL,119,"What is happening right now? What are you
doing?"
120,EMILY,120,I'm changing under this blanket.
121,KUMAIL,121,"I've seen everything. Do you remember, we
were just having sex?"
122,EMILY,122,"Yeah, but you were in the throes of
passion then. Listen, I had a really nice
time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna
call an Uber and go home."
123,KUMAIL,123,"Your driver will be ready as soon as he
puts on his pants."
124,EMILY,124,"Were you available for rides while we
were fucking?"
125,KUMAIL,125,"Yeah, but I only looked a couple of
times."
126,EMILY,126,Great. I'm glad we're on the same page.
127,Azmat,127,"Look at these jeans, Kumi. They're from
Citizens of Humanity, that's the
brand's name. Touch them. They're so
soft."
128,KUMAIL,128,I don't want to touch your jeans.
129,AZMAT,129,"They're like sweatpants. You should be
stylish like your father. It's not very
difficult. Just observe me."
130,NAVEED,130,Get some Daddy Style.
131,SHARMEEN,131,"Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not
like Naveed's, just a small one."
132,AZMAT,132,"Maybe like mine, small and stylish."
133,SHARMEEN,133,"Kumi, I've been thinking, you know, why
you don't enroll for LSAT now?"
134,KUMAIL,134,"Yeah sorry, Ma. I haven't done it yet.
I like that you bring it up as though
you've never brought it up before."
135,NAVEED,135,How's the stand-up coming Bhai?
136,KUMAIL,136,It's going fine.
137,SHARMEEN,137,"Since when are you someone to stand-up?
You know who I think should stand up is
Malala. She has something to say."
138,FATIMA,138,It's like he's dead. Or worse.
139,SHARMEEN,139,"It's very sad. Kumi, go pray now so we
can eat ice cream. Go! The ja-namaz is
downstairs."
140,NAVEED,140,Hurry up yaar. Ice cream.
141,AZMAT,141,"My mother used to make best kulfi. Your
grandmother."
142,KUMAIL,142,I think ice cream is better than kulfi.
143,AZMAT,143,"No, no-"
144,SHARMEEN,144,Oh. I wonder who that could be?
145,KUMAIL,145,"I'm guessing it's a young, single
Pakistani woman who just happened to be
driving by our house, which is in a cul-
de-sac and I'm also guessing that the
phrase ""dropped in"" will be said in the
next ten seconds."
146,AZMAT/NAVEED/FATIMA,146,Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven -
147,SHARMEEN,147,"Everyone. This is Zubeida. She just
dropped in."
148,ZUBEIDA,148,Salaam.
149,ALL,149,Wa alaikum salaam.
150,SHARMEEN,150,"Please, sit."
151,ZUBEIDA,151,"Here, Kumail. For your files. Your X-
Files. Because that's your favorite
show, huh?"
152,KUMAIL,152,Thank you so much.
153,ZUBEIDA,153,The truth is out there!
154,KUMAIL,154,It's from the show. Thank you.
155,SHARMEEN,155,I hope you come back.
156,SHARMEEN (CONT'D),156,"Kumi, there's not going to be a magic
spark, okay? You have to work at it. You
have to stay open."
157,KUMAIL,157,"Okay, Ma, yeah. I just wish you were
better at it, you know?"
158,KUMAIL (CONT'D),158,"I mean you've had so much practice and
you're still not that good at it!"
159,SHARMEEN,159,Ha. Ha. Ha.
160,KUMAIL,160,"You brought your A-game with Naveed, but
then with me, you're kind of just phoning
it in a little bit."
161,SHARMEN,161,"Again with the comedy, the comedy. All
the time with the comedy. Be serious!"
162,KUMAIL,162,"I am serious! That's why I want to help
you get better!"
163,EMILY,163,"So, are you ever going to let me sit in
the front seat?"
164,KUMAIL,164,"No, I'm a professional. And you're paying
for this ride."
165,EMILY,165,"I don't want to pay for this ride! It's
surging right now."
166,KUMAIL,166,"Yeah, sorry. You shouldn't have typed in
the number."
167,KUMAIL,167,"Okay. The year is 1969. MGM has had a
string of failures. So, it turns to its
most bankable star, Vincent Price."
168,EMILY,168,"Is this your compatibility test? Like,
the way people are with Vonnegut or The
Big Lebowski?"
169,KUMAIL,169,"No! Just watch the movie. And take it
seriously."
170,EMILY,170,"I'm going to love it. I love it when men
test me on my taste."
171,KUMAIL,171,"I just want to share this movie with you,
so I don't know why you're reading into-"
172,EMILY,172,"How many women have you shown this movie
to?"
173,KUMAIL,173,Zero.
174,EMILY,174,"How many women have you shown a B Horror
movie to on like, a third date."
175,KUMAIL,175,This is not a B horror movie.
176,KUMAIL (CONT'D),176,"Okay, you ready? Just close your eyes
cause when the menu comes up, there's
some spoilers in the menu."
177,EMILY,177,"I'm ready, I'm ready!"
178,KUMAIL,178,"Ok, I'll hit play."
179,KUMAIL (CONT'D),179,Watch!
180,EMILY,180,I'm watching!
181,KUMAIL,181,Shhhhhh! Watch this part.
182,EMILY,182,Stop watching me!
183,KUMAIL,183,No! Are you tired? We can watch it later.
184,EMILY,184,"I just have that weird yawning thing that
happens, when you're watching a really
boring film."
185,KUMAIL,185,"It's not boring! Wait for it to kick in.
The plot kicks in really soon."
186,EMILY,186,"That was fun. Thanks for the ride home,
but we gotta stop doing this."
187,KUMAIL,187,Yeah.
188,EMILY,188,"I know I've said that before, but I
really do mean it. I can't be doing this
right now."
189,KUMAIL,189,"I know. Totally. One hundred percent. I
agree with you."
190,EMILY,190,So don't call me again.
191,KUMAIL,191,I won't. I promise.
192,EMILY,192,Good luck on all your future endeavors.
193,KUMAIL,193,"Oh yeah, thank you. Hey, can we have an
awkward hug before we part forever?"
194,EMILY,194,Ok.
195,KUMAIL,195,Ok.
196,EMILY,196,Goodbye.
197,KUMAIL,197,Goodbye.
198,EMILY,198,"You just promised never to call me
again."
199,KUMAIL,199,"It's really cold out here. It's so
cold."
200,EMILY,200,You make a pretty good point.
201,EMILY (CONT'D),201,It's a lot warmer in here.
202,KUMAIL,202,It is warmer in here.
203,EMILY,203,"You know, it's really nice upstairs."
204,KUMAIL,204,Is it?
205,CJ,205,"Emily, has Kumail told you that in
addition to being an Uber driver he
also has a one-man show?"
206,EMILY,206,"No, he did not tell me that.   Do you
really?"
207,KUMAIL,207,"It's really nothing. It's just
something I'm fiddling around with."
208,KUMAIL,208,"I'm twelve years old. This...this is
home. Feels like I never left. Do you
smell that? That's my mom cooking the
Murgh Roghen Joash."
209,CJ,209,Fuck.
210,KUMAIL,210,"Do you hear that? That's my father
watching cricket on the telly. Do you
feel that? That's the weight of
Pakistan's history."
211,KUMAIL (CONT'D),211,"Pakistan was formed when it separated
from its biggest rival, India, on
August 14th 1947."
212,KUMAIL (CONT'D),212,Six runs!
213,KUMAIL (CONT'D),213,"Silly Mid On, Short Mid Wicket,
Midwicket, Deep Mid Wicket, Mid On, Long
On, Long Off..."
214,JESSIE,214,"I have to leave as soon as the show's
over. I can't stay."
215,KUMAIL,215,"So if you get a Silly Mid On fielder, you
know you're getting a Yorker soon."
216,KUMAIL (CONT'D),216,"So to review, Pakistan's biggest exports
are cotton and..."
217,AUDIENCE,217,Concrete.
218,CJ,218,Kill me.
219,KUMAIL,219,"Eid Mubarak. That's our Christmas.
Except instead of the traditional
Christmas ham, we serve Mitthai, which
my khansama Chris will serve to you
right now. Khansama is Urdu for
servant."
220,KUMAIL (CONT'D),220,"If you'd like to make it at home, the
main ingredients are condensed milk,
sugar, and love. At least, that was my
mom's recipe."
221,CJ,221,"Hey, you look like a children's toy from
Malaysia."
222,KUMAIL,222,"Now all rise for the Pakistani national
anthem."
223,KUMAIL,223,"So, really what did you think?   You know,
it's a work in progress..."
224,EMILY,224,"I really liked it. I learned a lot.
About Pakistan, and cricket. All those
positions. But I just wish that I
learned more about you. Does that make
any sense?"
225,KUMAIL,225,Yeah.
226,KUMAIL,226,Hey.
227,EMILY,227,"Oh, hi!"
228,KUMAIL,228,It's 3 AM.
229,EMILY,229,Is that diner around the corner open?
230,KUMAIL,230,"It's 24 hours. Why?   You want an old
lemon meringue pie?"
231,EMILY,231,"Everything is not okay. Everything is
not okay."
232,KUMAIL,232,"You can tell me anything, you know that
right? You can tell me anything."
233,EMILY,233,"I have to take a shit, okay? I have to
take a huge fucking dookie. I can't
take a poo in your bathroom because you
don't have any matches and you don't
have any air freshener. What kind of
person doesn't have any matches or air
freshener in the bathroom? The walls
are so thin! And Chris is right out
there."
234,EMILY (CONT'D),234,"Please stop laughing! Please, please."
235,KUMAIL,235,"Okay, I have an idea."
236,KUMAIL,236,How are you?
237,EMILY,237,I do not want to talk about it.
238,NAVEED,238,"Watch and learn, Bhai. It's all about
shifting weight and torque."
239,NAVEED (CONT'D),239,Oh Christ!
240,KUMAIL,240,Oh.
241,KUMAIL (CONT'D),241,You're like a Pakistani Sammy Sosa.
242,KUMAIL (CONT'D),242,"Hey he's pretty good. Just do what
he's doing."
243,NAVEED,243,Mine.
244,KUMAIL,244,Come on.
245,NAVEED,245,"Mine, mine."
246,KUMAIL,246,These cookies are really good.
247,NAVEED,247,"They're biscuits! Listen to yourself.
You hardly sound Pakistani. ""Cookies""?
You sound like Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
You're such a burger."
248,KUMAIL,248,I'm not a burger.
249,NAVEED,249,"Yes, you are. You're a big fat burger."
250,KUMAIL,250,"I'm not a burger and biscuit is actually
a British term."
251,NAVEED,251,"Well thank you for that information
that no one gives a shit about and you
should listen to mom and grow a beard."
252,KUMAIL,252,"It gets really itchy, I've tried. It's
all patchy."
253,NAVEED,253,"Try being a man and conditioning like I
do."
254,KUMAIL,254,"What's the whole thing with Muslims
growing beards anyway? It's such an
arbitrary thing. Like who decided that?
Oh, we have to have beards."
255,NAVEED,255,"Yeah. There are a billion of us and you
are the only one with the truth. Is
that right? The sun is just shining
down on you right now. It's just
parting like ""ahh""."
256,KUMAIL,256,"You know, I have to tell you something,
Bhai."
257,NAVEED,257,Here we go. Yeah?
258,KUMAIL,258,I've been dating this girl.
259,NAVEED,259,Acha.
260,KUMAIL,260,She's white.
261,NAVEED,261,"I thought you were going to say you were
involved in a hit and run or you got
caught forging some checks. But a WHITE
GIRL? Such a cliche."
262,KUMAIL,262,It's okay! We hate terrorists!
263,NAVEED,263,"Listen. I understand. You're in
America. You wanna mow a few lawns and
see what it's like. But eventually you
have to marry a Pakistani girl. Like I
hung out with other girls. But then I
married Fatima. We hardly spoke two
words to each other the first few
months! But now, Kumi, she's like my
best friend. You have to break up with
her immediately."
264,KUMAIL,264,"If I find someone who's as good for me
as Fatima is for you, Mom would
understand, right? I mean, she wouldn't
love me less?"
265,NAVEED,265,"She would definitely love you less.
Slowly, you'd sort of -- what's the
word when guys stop returning girls'
calls?"
266,KUMAIL,266,Ghosting?
267,NAVEED,267,Yes.
268,NAVEED,268,"You have to end it now or Mom will
fucking ghost you."
269,NAVEED (CONT'D),269,Now come on.
270,EMILY,270,"I'm getting a lot of bright fruit. I'd
say it's very fruit forward."
271,KUMAIL,271,"Uh huh. It tastes like grape juice
that's gone bad. How do you know so
much about wine?"
272,EMILY (CONT'D),272,"But I just wanted to tell you that I am
completely overwhelmed by you. It's the
last thing I was expecting."
273,KUMAIL,273,"This is also the last thing I was
expecting and I also feel completely
overwhelmed by you."
274,EMILY,274,That's a weird thing to say.
275,KUMAIL,275,"Why? I just said what you said. Exactly
what you said."
276,EMILY,276,"Yeah, but it wasn't weird when I said
it.   It's okay."
277,EMILY,277,"So listen, my parents are coming to
town this weekend. Maybe you wanna come
for lunch?"
278,KUMAIL,278,"Oh, we can't because of the two-day rule,
right? You'll come to Mary's party
Friday night and then you'll probably
spend the night. So I won't be able to
see you until Monday, so..."
279,EMILY,279,"Okay. Well, I would love to meet your
parents. They live in the city, right?"
280,KUMAIL,280,"Well, they live in the suburbs. You
know, I don't really see them very
much."
281,EMILY,281,"Have they asked about me? What do they
think? Do they want to meet me? My
parents want to meet you."
282,KUMAIL,282,"Of course, of course. They're dying to
meet you."
283,EMILY,283,Ow... oh my god..
284,KUMAIL,284,Are you okay? What happened?
285,EMILY,285,Totally fine.
286,KUMAIL,286,Do you need assistance?
287,EMILY,287,"I think I just tweaked my ankle. I took
this stupid hip hop dance class last
weekend."
288,KUMAIL,288,"You should get it looked at. Do you want
ice?"
289,EMILY,289,"Look, I'm walking on it. I'm totally
fine."
290,KUMAIL,290,"Can I get you a bag of ice? I can carry
you? I can carry you the rest of the day?"
291,EMILY,291,"Kumail, seriously, stop."
292,KUMAIL,292,"Hey, I liked your friends.     That Craig
guy or was it Greg?"
293,KUMAIL (CONT'D),293,"I can never tell with those names. I'm
glad I like him cause I don't want to
have to come up with excuses to avoid
him, you know. Like, oh no, I have
kite surfing tonight."
294,KUMAIL (O.S.) (CONT'D),294,"Did you know in the UK it's pronounced
""Crayg"". Which is good because that's
actually how it's written, right? He's
a ""Crate"" guy."
295,KUMAIL (CONT'D),295,I was going to tell you about that.
296,EMILY,296,"Are you like judging Pakistan's Next
Top Model or something? Seriously, who
are these women?"
297,KUMAIL,297,"You know how we have arranged marriage
in my culture? These are those women."
298,EMILY,298,"These are women in Pakistan who want to
marry you?"
299,KUMAIL,299,They're not in Pakistan.
300,EMILY,300,You've met these women?
301,KUMAIL,301,Just with my parents. We haven't like -
302,EMILY,302,"You're not serious about this, are you?"
303,KUMAIL,303,"It's my mom's thing, I just go along with
it."
304,EMILY,304,"So what does your mom think about you and
me, then?"
305,EMILY (CONT'D),305,"She doesn't know about me, does she?"
306,KUMAIL,306,No.
307,EMILY,307,"Fucking five months   of red flags. Oh my
god, I'm so stupid.   You ducking my
parents. Oh my god,   the two day rule!
Seriously, red flag   after red flag.
Such a liar!"
308,EMILY (CONT'D),308,"You lie to me. You lie to your parents.
And those are just the people you like!
Is there someone that you're not lying
to? I'd love to meet them, cause then I
could tell them what a fucking liar you
are!"
309,KUMAIL,309,"You didn't tell me about your being
divorced until recently. You were
hiding fucking something too!"
310,EMILY,310,"My divorce does not mean our future is
impossible. It actually means the
direct opposite. I'm not hiding
anything from you. Okay? I'm an open
fucking book. You wanna know what's in
my cigar box? Stickers. Stickers and
stamps."
311,KUMAIL,311,"Aren't you a therapist? Aren't you
supposed to be good at handling these
types of things."
312,EMILY,312,Where are my fucking shoes?
313,KUMAIL,313,"Aren't you supposed to be handling this
better than you are right now?"
314,EMILY,314,I'm expressing myself!
315,KUMAIL,315,"You know what we call ""arranged
marriage"" in my culture, Emily?
Marriage! Okay? We just call it
marriage. There's another type of
marriage that's called ""love marriage""
and that's bad. My cousin Rehan married
an Irish woman and he was kicked out of
the family! And nobody is allowed to
talk to him."
316,EMILY,316,Why didn't you tell me any of this?
317,KUMAIL,317,"Because I didn't think you'd fucking
understand and I was fucking right!"
318,EMILY,318,"You don't think I could fathom your life
in any fucking way?"
319,KUMAIL,319,"I'm fighting a fourteen hundred year
old culture! You were ugly in high
school! There's a big fucking
difference!"
320,KUMAIL,320,I'm sorry. I can't lose my family.
321,EMILY,321,"Can you imagine a world where we end up
together?"
322,KUMAIL,322,I don't know.
323,EMILY,323,I have to go. Don't fucking call me.
324,YAZMIN,324,"Multi-grain, pumpernickel, pita bread,
hot dog buns, croutons..I can't eat any
of it."
325,SAM,325,"I don't want kids. People say, Sam,
you're gonna love it. You're gonna have a
kid and he's gonna be your best friend.
A best friend that pukes on you and shits
everywhere, and is constantly screaming.
I already have friends like that. People
say, Sam..."
326,CJ,326,"I know you're bummed. Look, Emily's a
good person, I'm not saying she's not.
All I'm saying is this is the universe
telling you: seize your moment. Be a
little selfish and pursue your career.
Bob Dalavan's gonna be here on
Thursday. If you book the Montreal
Comedy Festival, it would change things
for you. You don't wanna get stuck in
Chicago, right? You don't wanna be like
Sam Highsmith. He's been doing the
""people say Sam"" bit since '03."
327,SAM,327,"People say, Sam..."
328,CJ,328,Is that what you want?
329,KHADIJA,329,"I wouldn't really call it an obsession
but... I'm pretty good at magic."
330,SHARMEEN,330,Can you make his belly disappear?
331,AZMAT,331,"No, I'm too happy with my belly."
332,KHADIJA,332,Does anyone have a dollar?
333,AZMAT,333,I will give you something.
334,KHADIJA,334,"20? Big spender. Andrew Jackson? Don't
you think he'd look cool with sunglasses?"
335,KHADIJA (CONT'D),335,We sprinkle the magic dust on.
336,KUMAIL,336,"Yeah, you can't do it without the magic
dust."
337,KHADIJA,337,"Yeah, I need it. All right..."
338,KHADIJA (CONT'D),338,Ok. Watching carefully -
339,FATIMA,339,"That is amazing! And he does look
better with glasses!"
340,KUMAIL,340,How did you do that?
341,KHADIJA,341,"Oh no, a magician never reveals her
tricks. Here's your twenty back, Mr.
Nanjiani."
342,AZMAT,342,"Do you think I could use this twenty
dollar bill to buy something?"
343,KHADIJA,343,"It looks better now, right?"
344,KUMAIL,344,"I was watching this monster movie with my
friend and he turned to me and was like,
""what would you do in that situation?""
I'm never going to be one of the last
guys alive. I'm going to be the first guy
to die. I die so the other characters get
to find out something weird is going on.
I go off alone to find the cat."
345,KUMAIL (CONT'D),345,"I never even find out that there were
monsters. To me, the plot of the movie
was ""we're at a research facility and the
cat's missing."" The end."
346,KUMAIL,346,Denise. This is your name in Urdu.
347,KUMAIL,347,"Yeah, let's go somewhere."
348,KUMAIL,348,Hello?
349,JESSIE,349,Kumail. It's Jessie.
350,KUMAIL,350,Hey.     Who?
351,JESSIE,351,"Jessie. I'm in school with Emily.
Listen, Emily is in the hospital."
352,KUMAIL,352,What?
353,JESSIE (V.O.),353,"Could you just go, please? She needs
someone there. We have exams tomorrow
so nobody else can go."
354,JESSIE (V.O.),354,"She's still in the ER. Could you just go
and sit with her? I was there for as long
as I could, but it's a crazy time for all
of us..."
355,KUMAIL,355,"Hi. I am looking for Emily Gardner. Um,
Emily Gardner? She was checked in..."
356,KUMAIL,356,Hey.
357,EMILY,357,What are you doing here?
358,KUMAIL,358,"Jessie called me and wanted me to make
sure you were okay. So how are you
doing?"
359,EMILY,359,"Fine. Totally fine. Never been better.
A thousand percent fine. Just like
fainted a little at work. I didn't have
breakfast this morning."
360,KUMAIL,360,"Breakfast is the most important meal of
the day. You know that."
361,NURSE BETTE,361,"Ms. Gardner. Your room will be ready
soon. Okay?"
362,EMILY,362,"Oh, no, actually I'd love to go home
and sleep in my own bed."
363,NURSE BETTE,363,"Sir, can you step outside a moment,
please? If you want to stay you have to
go to the security desk to get a pass."
364,KUMAIL,364,Where is the security desk?
365,NURSE BETTE,365,"It's downstairs. Exactly where you walked
in. At the security desk."
366,KUMAIL,366,"The security desk is at the security
desk. Got it."
367,KUMAIL,367,"Can I get you something? Water. Juice.
Coffee?"
368,DR. WRIGHT,368,May I speak with you for a second?
369,KUMAIL,369,I'll be right back.
370,DR. WRIGHT,370,"There is a massive infection in her
lungs. All her vitals are elevated.
Does she have HIV?"
371,KUMAIL,371,What? No. I mean she--
372,DR. WRIGHT,372,Are you her husband?
373,KUMAIL,373,No--
374,DR. WRIGHT,374,"We need to intubate her immediately. I
need a family member to sign this. So
I'm going to ask you again. Are you her
husband?"
375,KUMAIL,375,"What does ""intubate"" mean?"
376,DR. WRIGHT,376,"We have to put her on a respirator and
to do that we need to put her in a
medically induced coma."
377,KUMAIL,377,Coma.
378,DR. WRIGHT,378,"Yes, to stabilize her so we can work on
the infection. And it needs to happen
right now. So, I'm going to ask you one
last time, are you her husband?"
379,EMILY,379,"What's going on?! Where are you taking
me?"
380,NURSE JUDY,380,You should call her family.
381,KUMAIL,381,I'm sorry.
382,KUMAIL,382,"Hey, Mrs. Gardner? This is Kumail,
Emily's friend. I'm so sorry to be
calling you so late. Emily's fine.
Just want to get that taken care of.
She's fine. She is at City View
Hospital in Chicago in a medically
induced coma. But the doctors say that-
- Yes I did say coma."
383,KUMAIL,383,Hey. I'm Kumail.
384,BETH,384,We know who you are Kumail.
385,NURSE JUDY,385,"Mr. and Mrs. Gardner. The doctors would
like to see you now."
386,BETH,386,Be right back.
387,DR. LEWIN,387,"We immediately initiated orotracheal
intubation. Thankfully it hasn't affected
her heart at this point."
388,DR. WHELAN,388,"We don't know the exact nature of the
infection yet, but we've got her on a
broad spectrum of antibiotics."
389,DR. PLATT,389,"...critical infections centering around
the costodiaphragmatic--"
390,DR. SPELLMAN,390,"Our theory is methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus."
391,TERRY,391,"Hold on. Is staphylococcus with an ""f""
or a ""ph""?"
392,DR. SPELLMAN,392,Ph.
393,KUMAIL,393,"That was very reassuring, wasn't it?
Apparently, there are good and bad
comas. And the kind that they put her
in, the medically induced ones, are
definitely the good kind of coma."
394,KUMAIL (CONT'D),394,"Like you know how there are good and
bad carbs. Gremlins, those can be good
or bad."
395,TERRY,395,"Listen, Kumail... We're gonna handle
things from here. You've been very
helpful. Thank you. For signing the
thing-"
396,KUMAIL,396,My pleasure
397,TERRY,397,But you can go now.
398,KUMAIL,398,"Oh... okay... all right. Peace in the
Mideast."
399,CHRIS,399,"What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at
the airport get a boner. Does that mean
drugs or bombs?"
400,CJ,400,"That's good. What if instead of it being
at the airport, you quit comedy and never
did comedy ever again?"
401,CHRIS,401,Fuck you. It's a good bit.
402,CJ,402,"Just for the sake of the public. So they
wouldn't have to look at your face or
hear your words."
403,KUMAIL,403,"It's okay that I'm not there, right?
Like, I don't need to be there, right?"
404,SAM,404,What happened?
405,CHRIS,405,"He put his girlfriend in a coma. You
know, the way you do."
406,MARY,406,"He signed a paper that allowed doctors to
put her--"
407,CJ,407,He suggested it.
408,KUMAIL,408,"She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine.
They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors
know medical stuff. That's what doctors
do. They're good at medical stuff. This
is a medically induced coma. This is
their specialty."
409,MARY,409,Maybe.
410,CHRIS,410,"It might be a good thing. She might wake
up with a new skill. Like my cousin
blacked out once and when he came to, he
thought he knew a different language."
411,CJ,411,Did he?
412,CHRIS,412,"No, it was just gibberish that he made
up. It was brain damage."
413,SAM,413,I got another Taco Bell one...
414,BETH,414,Did you forget something?
415,KUMAIL,415,Is she up yet?
416,TERRY,416,"No, she's not. They won't tell us
anything. We've been here all morning."
417,KUMAIL,417,"I know you guys said you don't need me
to stay, but I think I'm just going to
wait anyway."
418,BETH,418,"You guys broke up. I'm not sure why
you're here. You don't have to worry
about being committed to anything,
Kumail. You didn't want to when she was
awake. There's no need to do it when
she's unconscious."
419,KUMAIL,419,It's more complicated than that--
420,BETH,420,"Is it? Because I know about the two-day
rule, I know about the headshots and the
secrets. She tells us everything."
421,BETH,421,"You really don't have to stay Kumail. You
have already done a lot."
422,KUMAIL,422,"I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this
seat- ?"
423,KUMAIL (CONT'D),423,Is that lady still looking at me?
424,TERRY,424,"No reason you should eat there by
yourself. Right, hon?"
425,BETH,425,It's a free country.
426,KUMAIL,426,How's your sandwich?
427,BETH,427,Best fuckin' sandwich I've ever had.
428,TERRY,428,"Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble.
You know, we're not by the water. Well,
we are by the water, but it's a lake.
There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever.
I threw the dice. I got the 7's, I
guess. Whatever the good dice number
is."
429,TERRY (CONT'D),429,"So, uh, 9/11?"
430,TERRY (CONT'D),430,"No, I mean, I've always wanted to have a
conversation about it with...people."
431,KUMAIL,431,You've never talked to people about 9/11?
432,TERRY,432,"No, uh, what's your stance?"
433,KUMAIL,433,"What's my stance on 9/11? Oh, ummmm...
Anti. It was a tragedy."
434,KUMAIL,434,I mean we lost 19 of our best guys.
435,BETH,435,Huh?
436,KUMAIL,436,"That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a
terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to
joke about it."
437,KUMAIL (CONT'D),437,"Hey, can I come?
TERRY                            BETH"
438,BETH,438,Whatever.
439,DR. CUNNINGHAM,439,"I know this isn't the news you were
hoping for but we aren't ready to bring
Emily out of the coma yet."
440,BETH,440,Oh. I-
441,TERRY,441,What happened?
442,DR. CUNNINGHAM,442,"The antibiotics aren't doing exactly
what we'd hoped they would, and we
don't want to mess around. So we're
going to perform surgery tomorrow
morning to remove the infection."
443,BETH,443,"Wait a second- Dr. Spellman told us
that the antibiotics would work. He
didn't say anything at all about
surgery."
444,TERRY,444,"What does that mean? What kind of
surgery?"
445,DR. CUNNINGHAM,445,"It's called thoracentesis, it's a very
common procedure. We're going to go in
between the ribs and remove the
infection."
446,TERRY,446,"How do you spell that please? Thora- ?
What's the last part?"
447,DR. CUNNINGHAM,447,-Centesis.
448,BETH,448,And where is the infection?
449,DR. CUNNINGHAM,449,On the lung.
450,BETH,450,What's the risk?
451,DR. CUNNINGHAM,451,"Low. My advice to you is that you go
home, you get something to eat, and try
to relax."
452,TERRY,452,"She left the lights on, eh?"
453,BETH,453,My favorite sweater.
454,BETH (CONT'D),454,I'm gonna do some research.
455,TERRY,455,"Oh hey, that's the book I gave her."
456,BETH,456,"No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you
have that little notebook from the
doctors?"
457,TERRY,457,"No, this is the book I gave her."
458,KUMAIL,458,"I'm just gonna clean up Emily's rooms
real quick."
459,BETH,459,"I remember. I met her at the falafel
place and then we went to that book store
that's hardly ever open and I bought it
for her."
460,TERRY,460,"You're not the only one who gives her
things."
461,BETH,461,What's up with you?
462,TERRY,462,"I'm just tired of you thinking that
you're the only one who gives her things.
I gave her that book."
463,BETH,463,Look at the inscription.
464,TERRY,464,No. That's stupid.
465,TERRY (O.S.),465,Kumail.
466,KUMAIL,466,Hey.
467,TERRY,467,"Sorry... Didn't mean to surprise you. I
was just wondering if we wanna do
anything. Got any parlor games..."
468,KUMAIL,468,I don't-what are parlor games?
469,TERRY,469,"Card games, word games. You play any word
games?"
470,KUMAIL,470,"No, I've never played-"
471,TERRY,471,You ever played You Can't Rhyme It?
472,KUMAIL,472,How does that go?
473,TERRY,473,"It's basically where you try to find a
word, a real word, that nobody can rhyme."
474,KUMAIL,474,"Ok, Stonehenge."
475,TERRY,475,"Yeah, see you would win. That'd be a
winner."
476,KUMAIL,476,"I don't play board games. I play video
games."
477,TERRY,477,"That's the thing. Everybody now needs
Nintendo, the game thing, electronics, a
thousand dollars. When I was a kid, a
piece of chalk and a pavement, that's
your entertainment. Hopscotch, tic tac
toe, throw the chalk at Jimmy. There you
go, three games right there."
478,KUMAIL,478,Jimmy was a real guy?
479,TERRY,479,"Yeah, well there was no particular Jimmy,
whoever got hit with the chalk, he was
the Jimmy."
480,TERRY (CONT'D),480,I'm just trying to figure out what to do.
481,KUMAIL,481,"Yeah, tonight's no good for me. I'd
love to, but I'm actually gigging
tonight, which is like an industry word
we use for when we do shows."
482,TERRY,482,Really?
483,KUMAIL,483,"Yeah, there's a big Montreal Comedy
festival audition coming up, and I'm
actually headlining tonight."
484,KUMAIL,484,That's a good point.
485,TERRY,485,"We'll sit in the back. They got food
there?"
486,KUMAIL,486,They've got waffle fries and um-
487,TERRY,487,The hospital had waffle fries too.
488,SUMERA,488,"I've actually never been to   Pakistan. My
parents moved here for grad   school and
they just stayed here. I've   never even
been to Canada. So uh, when   is Kumail
coming?"
489,SHARMEEN,489,"He's coming. Right, Naveed? Traffic?"
490,NAVEED,490,"I heard everything's bumper-to-bumper
on the Dan Ryan Expressway."
491,SUMERA,491,"That's weird because I took the Dan
Ryan Expressway here."
492,CHRIS,492,"What is your dad's sister's favorite kind
of music to dance to?"
493,KUMAIL,493,Emily's parents are here.
494,CHRIS (O.S.),494,"Auntz, auntz, auntz."
495,MARY,495,Tonight? Why?
496,CHRIS,496,Is anybody here from out of town?
497,CHRIS (CONT'D),497,"A few, a few. What's your name, sir?"
498,TERRY,498,Terry.
499,CHRIS,499,"Terry. And who's this lady next to you?
Is it Cloth? A little Terry Cloth?"
500,BETH,500,It's Beth.
501,CHRIS,501,"Beth. Pretty close. Terry-Beth, where
are you guys from?"
502,TERRY,502,We're from North Carolina.
503,CHRIS,503,"Ooh North Carolina. The Tar Heel State!
Home of Krispy Kreme donuts! And what
brings you to Chicago?"
504,BETH,504,Our daughter's in a coma.
505,CHRIS,505,Where are you from?
506,SUMERA,506,"It's getting late, I should go."
507,AZMAT,507,"No, I think I should call him up, I'll
just call him up."
508,AZMAT,508,"Hello, Kumi-beta? What do you mean, who
is calling? This is your father. Ok, ok."
509,AZMAT,509,He will be here any moment.
510,AZMAT,510,"I just faked that call. Did you call
him?"
511,NAVEED,511,A hundred times. No response.
512,SUMERA,512,I think I should make something clear.
513,SUMERA,513,I can understand what you're saying.
514,FATIMA,514,"I thought you said you'd never been to
Pakistan."
515,SUMERA,515,"I said I'd never been there but we speak
it at home."
516,AZMAT,516,"For someone who's never been to Pakistan
you speak Urdu very well."
517,SUMERA,517,Thanks.
518,AZMAT,518,Do you want to sing?
519,KUMAIL,519,"I want to name my kid Void so he won't be
able to cash any of his paychecks."
520,KUMAIL (CONT'D),520,"I'm sorry, sir, this says Void on it. But
that's my name. Curse you, father!"
521,KUMAIL (CONT'D),521,"I work on the second floor of the bank in
this fantasy scenario."
522,HECKLER,522,Go back to ISIS!
523,KUMAIL,523,Toast is a really strange food.
524,BETH,524,What did you just say?
525,HECKLER,525,"I said, he should go back to ISIS."
526,KUMAIL,526,Toast is the only food that-
527,BETH,527,"Well that's a really confusing
position. Do you want ISIS to have more
people?"
528,HECKLER,528,No I was saying that to him because...
529,BETH,529,"Guess what everybody? We've got an ISIS
recruiter here."
530,KUMAIL,530,"Glad we got to the bottom of that.
Toast is like a-"
531,BETH,531,"What is it about him that made you say
that?"
532,KUMAIL,532,I think we know what the answer is.
533,HECKLER,533,Lady I wasn't talking to you.
534,BETH,534,What is it about him?
535,KUMAIL,535,"We don't have to go down this path. We
know what's at the end of it."
536,HECKLER,536,Cuz of how he looks.
537,KUMAIL,537,There it is.
538,BETH,538,"That is like saying that all frat boys
wearing country club hats and Hawaiian
shirts have shriveled up, tiny little
dicks!"
539,KUMAIL,539,"Actually, Beth, this is a bad way for
you to find out, but he's right. I
actually am a terrorist. I just do
stand-up comedy on the side to keep a
low profile."
540,HECKLER,540,Fuck you.
541,KUMAIL,541,"First of all, very clever. Did you write
that at home? Toast is-"
542,BETH,542,Fuck you!
543,HECKLER,543,Fuck you.
544,BETH,544,No fuck you!
545,HECKLER,545,"You're a bitch, you know that?"
546,BETH,546,"I'm gonna fucking kill you! What's your
fucking phone number?!"
547,TERRY,547,I'm sorry everybody. I'm sorry.
548,TERRY (CONT'D),548,"I'm not sorry actually cause you're a
terrible person... I don't want to kick
your ass here in front of everybody.
Yeah, that's right. I've got levels,
motherfucker. This elevator goes all
the way fucking down, you fucking
prick!"
549,BETH,549,I think I'll make tea.
550,BETH,550,Actually I'll open a bottle of wine.
551,BETH,551,Does Emily have whiskey?
552,KUMAIL,552,On top of the fridge.
553,TERRY,553,"So uh, Cubs doing good, huh?"
554,KUMAIL,554,I don't know anything about baseball.
555,BETH,555,"I am so sorry about that. That was... I
just sort of lost control."
556,TERRY,556,I thought it was sexy.
557,KUMAIL,557,"Me too. Not like sexy, but like cool
sexy. Not like aroused sexy. I'm gonna
not say sexy anymore."
558,BETH,558,"Hey, you guys wanna get something to eat?"
559,BETH,559,So is it always like that?
560,KUMAIL,560,"Oh like tonight? No, usually a
different mom comes in to help me. I'm
joking. No, it's not always like that.
I'd quit if it was."
561,TERRY,561,Here's a joke.
562,BETH,562,"No, Terry, don't. Terry's about as
funny as a fart at a funeral."
563,TERRY,563,"This is funny, this is a funny one. A
giraffe walks into a bar and he says to
the bartender, ""Highballs on me."" You
get it, right?"
564,KUMAIL,564,Oh that was the end of the joke?
565,TERRY,565,Yes.
566,KUMAIL,566,That was the whole joke?
567,TERRY,567,"That's the joke. That's the beauty of it,
boom."
568,KUMAIL,568,I thought there was more.
569,TERRY,569,"He's a giraffe, he's tall, so it would
stand to reason his testicles are high
and a highball is a type of drink, and
you ruined it by saying I wasn't funny
first."
570,KUMAIL,570,"No, it's good. I like my jokes thoroughly
explained."
571,TERRY,571,You're just busting my high balls.
572,TERRY,572,"Complex finish. Flamboyant mouth-feel.
Good. How about you?"
573,KUMAIL,573,"Hmm, fruit-forward."
574,TERRY,574,Good term. Absolutely fruit-forward.
575,KUMAIL,575,"This one is in the front seat. It's
driving the wine car."
576,TERRY,576,Exactly.
577,BETH,577,I like wine cause of the buzz.
578,TERRY,578,She's a bit of a lightweight.
579,BETH,579,"So is Terry! He'll be passed out on the
sofa in less than an hour!"
580,TERRY,580,"Ah that's nonsense. You know that's not
true."
581,BETH,581,"You weren't supposed to be on the show
tonight, were you?"
582,KUMAIL,582,"Oh? Me on the show tonight? Yeah, yeah
I was. I was the headliner."
583,KUMAIL (CONT'D),583,"Okay. I lied about the show to get out
of hanging out with you guys. And then
I lied about headlining to impress you
guys."
584,BETH,584,Well that didn't work.
585,KUMAIL,585,"Also, I think I screwed up with your
daughter."
586,BETH,586,"Yeah, you did."
587,BETH,587,"I don't know how people do it when
their family's sick. My Uncle Lew, he
got cancer, then he had a stroke, then
a heart attack, then he had a
recurrence of the cancer. But you know
what killed him?"
588,KUMAIL,588,Cancer?
589,BETH,589,"Car accident. We think maybe it was a
heart attack while he was driving. And
he did still have cancer too. And you
know what? He ate sprouts his whole
fucking life. Hadn't had a yolk in 30
years. I don't know how I'm going to
sleep tonight."
590,KUMAIL,590,You wanna stress eat?
591,BETH,591,Fuck yeah.
592,KUMAIL,592,Oh my god.
593,BETH,593,"Most noticeable. Oh no, hold on,
there's more."
594,BETH (CONT'D),594,The legendary cemetery photo shoot.
595,KUMAIL,595,Oh my god.
596,BETH,596,"I laughed so hard when I saw these. She
got so mad at me."
597,KUMAIL,597,You're gonna wake him up.
598,BETH,598,"Are you kidding me? He can sleep through
anything. Hey Terry!"
599,KUMAIL,599,How did you and Terry meet?
600,BETH,600,"I was going to East Carolina University
and I was waiting tables. We met at
this coffee shop, I was waiting on him.
I liked his hair. He was a teacher
already. Thick New York accent like
nobody I'd ever met. Totally wrong for
me. So naturally we fell-in-love. My
family could not stand him. We're all
military people, army pilots. All my
brothers played football. Terry
couldn't even change a tire. My father
got so mad he broke every dinner plate
we had. Now back then, you go to the
gas station, you fill up your tank, you
get a dinner plate. But just one at a
time. Cup, saucer. It took us a year of
fill-ups to get the whole set back. And
Terry just stuck around. Eventually
they just all got over it."
601,KUMAIL,601,They just got over it. How?
602,BETH,602,"Lots of fucked up dinners. How'd your
parents meet, Kumail?"
603,KUMAIL,603,"So we have arranged marriage as you
know. A big group got together to see a
movie, but really it was just a set up
so my mom and dad could meet."
604,BETH,604,What movie did they see?
605,KUMAIL,605,I have no idea. I never asked.
606,BETH,606,"She's great, you know?"
607,KUMAIL,607,I know.
608,BETH,608,I feel good about this surgery.
609,KUMAIL,609,"Yeah. These doctors know what they're
doing."
610,BETH,610,"No they don't. They're just winging it
like everybody else."
611,KUMAIL,611,Fuck.
612,EMILY'S VOICE,612,"Hey it's me. So I tried making some
Pakistani food to surprise you. And
either I'm a bad cook or all Pakistani
food is terrible. I don't know yet. Bye!"
613,EMILY'S VOICE,613,"Hey it's me. If you just wanna come over
and like kiss me for two seconds, I'd
really love that tonight. Ok. Bye!"
614,EMILY'S VOICE (CONT'D),614,"Hey it's me. So did you want to meet at
the gallery, or - Oh my god! Oh my god, a
bird just hit me in the head. Oh my god
I'm not kidding. I'll call you right
back. Oh my god, is it okay?"
615,DR. SPELLMAN,615,"The infection around the lungs was
removed. We should be able to pull her
out soon."
616,TERRY,616,Oh boy.
617,BETH,617,How soon?
618,DR. SPELLMAN,618,"She should be up by tomorrow morning at
the latest. We'll also test the pleural
fluid from the thoracentesis so we can
create a more targeted antibiotic
strategy."
619,BETH,619,So this is good news?
620,DR. SPELLMAN,620,"It's very good news. We'll just hold
onto her for a few more days and then
you can have her back."
621,TERRY,621,"She's a fighter, right?"
622,DR. SPELLMAN,622,Yes.
623,SHARMEEN,623,"I was so worried. We saw on the news
that a train derailed and we thought
that you were on the train and you had
died."
624,KUMAIL,624,"Nobody died on that train, Ma."
625,SHARMEEN,625,But did they look under the train?
626,SHARMEEN (CONT'D),626,"And these are her parents, Farhan and
Tina. They also just dropped in."
627,KHADIJA,627,"I've just been through so many of these
appointments and I never have anything in
common with the guys. You know when girls
at work complain about dating, I just
want to body slam them. They have no
idea. I don't know. My mom says I'm
becoming the bruised apple at the bottom
of the apple bucket."
628,KUMAIL,628,"No, no. You're not."
629,KHADIJA,629,I am.
630,KUMAIL,630,You're not.
631,KHADIJA,631,"So do you want to hangout sometime? Like
without our parents? Have you been to the
cat cafe? The cats just come up to you
and nestle in your lap and you just pet
them."
632,KUMAIL,632,I don't think that's a good idea.
633,KHADIJA,633,You don't like cats?
634,KUMAIL,634,"I mean I don't think it's a good idea for
us to hangout again. It's not you. You're
fantastic. I just can't do this arranged
marriage thing -- with anybody."
635,KHADIJA,635,So why did you meet me?
636,KUMAIL,636,It wasn't my idea.
637,KHADIJA,637,"I'm just really tired. Do you ever want
to just be in a relationship so you can
finally relax?"
638,KUMAIL,638,I'm sorry. You deserve better than me.
639,KHADIJA,639,"People are always telling me what I
deserve. It's bullshit. And stop being so
sorry about everything. I'm gonna go."
640,KHADIJA (CONT'D),640,"And you know what? I watched the X-Files,
like three whole episodes, and it's a bad
show."
641,TERRY,641,"Wow, they should call this website,
""Everything is Cancer Dot Com"".
Everything you put in, it could be
cancer. Hiccups could be cancer. Come on.
You take the fun out of hiccups now."
642,BETH,642,"Do you know this is the 17th best
hospital in Chicago?"
643,TERRY,643,Really? Out of how many?
644,BETH,644,"I don't know, but Northwestern's number
one."
645,TERRY,645,"Well how do they rate it? What's their
methodology?"
646,BETH,646,"I don't know, Terry. But 17th is bad."
647,TERRY,647,"It's not great, unless the sample size
is, you know, that all depends."
648,KUMAIL,648,"Here, look at the comments."
649,TERRY,649,"This is why I don't want to go online
cause it's never good. You go online,
they hated Forrest Gump. Frickin' best
movie ever."
650,DR. CUNNINGHAM,650,Terry - Hi. Can we talk?
651,TERRY,651,Yeah.
652,DR. CUNNINGHAM,652,"We got the biopsy results. They are
unfortunately inconclusive. We are
concerned-"
653,TERRY,653,"They couldn't find out what the disease
was, or where the virus came from or
the bacteria or whatever."
654,KUMAIL,654,"But they took out the infection so it
shouldn't matter?"
655,TERRY,655,"I know, that's what I said but her
vitals didn't normalize. And now they
say that the infection is continuing to
spread, it's in her kidneys."
656,KUMAIL,656,"But the kidneys are so far from the
lungs."
657,TERRY,657,"I know, it's an aggressive infection
and they said what they gotta do now is
figure out what this mystery disease
actually is."
658,BETH,658,I'm calling Northwestern.
659,TERRY,659,"Just hold on, hold on."
660,BETH,660,Terry! Goddammit!
661,KUMAIL,661,I think we should talk about this--
662,BETH,662,"--You shut up! I'm sick of this shit,
Terry. We're getting her out of here!"
663,TERRY,663,"They're in the middle of the whole
process of elimination."
664,BETH,664,"So you're saying Northwestern can't
take that information and continue the
search? This place is a shithole."
665,BETH (CONT'D),665,"I'm sorry. Anna, could I have that?"
666,TERRY,666,"Will you just stop for a second? They're
the doctors. You act like you know what
you're talking about. You don't."
667,BETH,667,"I can't find my cellphone. You got a
phone?"
668,TERRY,668,"Don't give her a phone. You don't need a
phone. You don't need to call anybody
right now."
669,TERRY (CONT'D),669,"They're doing it. They're the experts
here, and I trust them."
670,BETH,670,"Well that's very nice. But I don't. Can
you unlock that thing?"
671,BETH (CONT'D),671,"There's a reason why they're #17 and
Northwestern's #1. And it's not because
people trust them!"
672,TERRY,672,"Oh - you think that you're smarter than
me because you say big sentences. Well
you're not!"
673,BETH,673,"I don't think I'm smarter than you! You
just don't think you're as smart as I
am! That's not my fault!"
674,TERRY,674,"Right. It's never your fault.
Everything's my fault."
675,BETH,675,"Oh there are some things that are
definitely just your fault."
676,TERRY,676,"Okay, that's bullshit. You need to stop
freaking out and calm down."
677,BETH,677,And you need to stop being a coward.
678,TERRY,678,"Greatest hits, coming back. You can
stop, I'll replay the rest of this from
memory."
679,NURSE JUDY,679,"Oh, you're giraffe-ing it."
680,KUMAIL,680,"It was the biggest thing they had. I
don't even know if she likes giraffes. We
never talked about giraffes. Hey, do
they know what they're doing? Cause
they don't tell us anything. Like, Lyme
Disease? You know the girl on The Real
World had it? Did you guys look for
that?"
681,NURSE JUDY,681,"Yes, we did."
682,KUMAIL,682,"Did you know she gets hurt all the
time? She messed up her ankle recently -
could that be Lupus?"
683,NURSE JUDY,683,"Kumail. We're looking into everything.
We're not holding anything back from
you. We're still just eliminating
possibilities."
684,KUMAIL,684,"Cause Beth wants to move her to
Northwestern."
685,NURSE JUDY,685,"Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The
hospital will approve it because it'll
get the liability off their hands, but
we put her in a coma for a reason. To
stabilize her. Moving her could be very
dangerous. The infection could spread.
Trust me she is fighting. And so are
we."
686,KUMAIL,686,"Hey Terry. I was just talking to the
nurse - You okay?"
687,TERRY,687,"Yeah, of course. Totally fine."
688,TERRY (CONT'D),688,"Beth went to Emily's, so I'm gonna wait
here until they kick me out. Keep an
eye on her."
689,KUMAIL,689,Do you wanna crash at my place?
690,TERRY,690,You got the golf channel?
691,KUMAIL,691,No.
692,TERRY,692,"That wasn't funny, right?"
693,KUMAIL,693,I thought that was a serious question.
694,TERRY,694,Let's get the fuck out of here.
695,KUMAIL,695,So this is the place.
696,TERRY,696,Wow...this place is terrible.
697,KUMAIL,697,"Hey I talked to Nurse Judy, and she was
saying that moving Emily could be a bad
idea."
698,TERRY,698,Really?
699,KUMAIL,699,"Yeah, she said it could be dangerous."
700,KUMAIL (CONT'D),700,Like...
701,TERRY,701,"No. Yeah. I hear you. I'd give anything
to trade places with Emily. Being a
parent, it's a nightmare. Loving
somebody this much sucks."
702,KUMAIL,702,Yeah.
703,TERRY,703,"And I guess you've noticed some tension
between Beth and me."
704,KUMAIL,704,Not really. That's none of my business.
705,TERRY,705,"Yeah well, it's there. Big time."
706,KUMAIL,706,"It's getting really late. We should go
to sleep."
707,TERRY,707,I cheated on her.
708,KUMAIL,708,Fuuuuck.
709,TERRY,709,I did. It was just a one night stand.
710,KUMAIL,710,Okay.
711,TERRY,711,"We met at some bar in Cincinnati. They
have these teacher conferences. Who
goes to a math conference to get laid?"
712,KUMAIL,712,Math teachers?
713,TERRY,713,"Yeah. I think I was depressed, that's
what it was."
714,KUMAIL,714,"Yeah. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Get a
full night's sleep. Catch up fresh in the-"
715,TERRY,715,"She just smelled so good. It was horrible
too. As soon as I was finished. As soon
as I'd finished, I was like, what did you
fucking do?! What did you just do?!"
716,TERRY (CONT'D),716,"What did you do?! You know that moment of
clarity you get right after an orgasm?"
717,KUMAIL,717,Yup.
718,TERRY,718,"I told Beth right away. I had to. She
was devastated. Now she hates me."
719,KUMAIL,719,"She might be mad at you, but she doesn't
hate you. You should've heard the way she
was talking about you. Hey, can I ask you
something? Why did you tell her?"
720,TERRY,720,"Oh, I had to. I'm no good with guilt."
721,KUMAIL,721,Do you guys talk about it?
722,TERRY,722,"Not anymore. She said she forgave me,
but no. She hasn't. Let me give you
some advice Kumail. You're going to
know the woman you want to spend the
rest of your life with when you cheat
on her. When you cheat on her and you
just feel like shit."
723,KUMAIL,723,"So, to fully know I love someone, I
have to cheat on them?"
724,TERRY,724,"Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's
terrible advice."
725,TERRY (CONT'D),725,"Love isn't easy. That's why they call
it love."
726,KUMAIL,726,I don't really get that either.
727,TERRY,727,"I know. I thought I could just start
saying something and something smart
would come out."
728,KUMAIL,728,Hey did you see Terry?
729,CHRIS,729,"No, I heard him leave this morning. I'm
going to Sevies. You want anything?"
730,KUMAIL,730,"No, I'm good, thank you."
731,CHRIS,731,You don't want a hot dog or nothing?
732,KUMAIL,732,Dude it's 8:30 in the morning.
733,CHRIS,733,"Okay, no hot dog."
734,SHARMEEN,734,We just spoke to Khadija's parents.
735,KUMAIL,735,What are you doing here?
736,SHARMEEN,736,"What is wrong with you, Kumi?"
737,KUMAIL,737,Nothing is wrong with me. I'm sorry-
738,SHARMEEN,738,Sorry? That's all you have to say?
739,KUMAIL,739,I wasn't that into her.
740,KUMAIL (CONT'D),740,"We come here but we pretend like we're
still back there? That's so stupid!"
741,AZMAT,741,"Don't you talk to your mother like
that!"
742,KUMAIL,742,"You don't care what I think. You just
want me to follow the rules. But the
rules don't make sense to me. I don't
pray. I don't. I haven't prayed in
years. I just go down there and I play
video games."
743,AZMAT,743,You don't believe in Allah?
744,KUMAIL,744,"I don't know what I believe, Dad! I
don't know. And I can't marry someone
you find for me."
745,SHARMEEN,745,And why not?
746,KUMAIL,746,"Because I'm in love with someone. I am.
Her name is Emily and she's gonna be a
therapist. And right now she's very
sick but I couldn't tell you that. It
makes me so sad that I couldn't tell
you any of that. I really appreciate
everything you've done for me. I truly,
truly do. And I know Islam has been
really good for you, it has made you
good people, but I don't know what I
believe. I just need to figure it out
on my own."
747,SHARMEEN,747,You're not my son.
748,AZMAT,748,"Kumi, you're being selfish. You're not
thinking about us. You're not thinking
about Khadija. In fact you're not even
thinking about that girl that you are in
love with. You think American Dream is
just about doing whatever you want and
not thinking about other people?"
749,AZMAT (CONT'D),749,You're wrong! You are wrong!
750,CHRIS,750,"Hey... I never went to the store. I was
just listening at the door. My mom kicked
me out for dealing weed at sixteen, so I
get it man."
751,KUMAIL,751,"Hey, so when are we going to talk to Beth
about what we talked about?"
752,TERRY,752,We're gonna move her.
753,KUMAIL,753,"What? What are you talking about? You
fucking caved?"
754,TERRY,754,I didn't cave. I don't cave.
755,KUMAIL,755,"Okay, okay. I know you don't cave. You're
great. But we talked about this last
night."
756,TERRY,756,I know. We're moving her. She's right.
757,KUMAIL,757,"What? No. I told you what the nurse
said. Hey Beth, the nurse told me that
moving Emily could be a very bad idea."
758,BETH,758,"Well Northwestern told us it could be
very good."
759,KUMAIL,759,"Well, they don't see her. This nurse
sees her and she told me herself."
760,TERRY,760,It's okay. They don't need to see her.
761,KUMAIL,761,It's not okay. There. I got it!
762,TERRY,762,That's a map of the garage.
763,KUMAIL,763,"Wait, wait! Do you want to be
responsible? She could die!"
764,BETH,764,"Kumail, we're responsible for her no
matter what. We're her parents. Now I'm
sorry, we're moving her."
765,STU,765,"Welcome to Quick'n Hot. May I take your
order please?"
766,KUMAIL,766,"Yeah, um can I get a burger with 4
slices of cheese."
767,STU,767,Four burgers. Anything else sir?
768,KUMAIL,768,"No. One burger with four slices of
cheese."
769,KUMAIL (CONT'D),769,One burger with four-
770,STU,770,I'm sorry. We can't do that.
771,KUMAIL,771,"Just put 4 slices of cheese on a
burger."
772,STU,772,We can't do that. There's no button -
773,KUMAIL,773,"Who the fuck is this ""we"", man? Who the
fuck is this ""we""? It's me and you.
We're just people. Fucking listen to
me. Fuck this corporate entity. Put
four slices of cheese on THE FUCKING
BURGER."
774,STU,774,We can't do that.
775,KUMAIL,775,"What the fuck, you fucking idiot?"
776,KUMAIL (CONT'D),776,"Hey, look at me. Cause I'm a human
being. You're a human being. Look at
me. Look me in the eyes when you fuck
me! Look at me. PLEASE!"
777,STU,777,Today's my first day.
778,KUMAIL,778,Fuck you!
779,STU,779,I'll just ring you up for four burgers.
780,KUMAIL,780,I'm sorry.
781,STU,781,"Do you want any fries or drink with
that?"
782,KUMAIL,782,I'll take four fries. I'm sorry.
783,KUMAIL,783,Fuck!
784,CHRIS,784,"Hey man, Montreal finals. You ready? Oh
wait, are you getting all dark and
moody before your set? Yeah, punish
yourself like a nasty little baby."
785,KUMAIL,785,I am not in the mood. Okay Chris?
786,CHRIS,786,I'll get you in the mood.
787,CHRIS (CONT'D),787,I'll get you all in the mood.
788,CJ,788,You all right?
789,KUMAIL,789,"Why does everybody say the same fucking
thing? Yeah, I'm doing great."
790,CJ,790,"Okay, all right dude. I'm just checking."
791,DODD,791,"The fuck've you been, man? You're on
next!"
792,TERRY (O.S.),792,"Kumail, it's Terry. Listen, we're not
moving here. The doctors, they said.."
793,DODD,793,"This next performer, my man, Mr. Kumail
Nanjiani!"
794,KUMAIL,794,"Have you guys heard of this new drug
cocktail called cheese? Like that's the
name of it, it's called cheese. I saw
all these news reports, and they were
like, there's a new drug, it's called
cheese. Everyone's doing it in the
Midwest, kids are doing it."
795,KUMAIL (CONT'D),795,"It's just really hard to do stand-up
comedy when your girlfriend is in a
coma."
796,KUMAIL (CONT'D),796,"Not quite sure what part you're
laughing at. They say she's fighting,
but she doesn't look like she's
fighting. She looks like she's just
laying there. I said horrible things to
her. I hurt her. She loves birds. Like
she gets excited every time she sees a
bird. She's like, look at this, it's a
bird. And I'm always like, yeah,
they're all over the place, they're
birds. But she likes that bird. Every
bird she sees, she sees it."
797,KUMAIL (CONT'D),797,"Her dad just called and said that they
can't transfer her because the infection
has reached her heart. Which means..."
798,KUMAIL (CONT'D),798,She could die.
799,KUMAIL,799,"I don't know if you can hear me or not,
but it would be really good if you pulled
through. If you have to go, you can go,
but it would be really great if you
stayed. And I'm really sorry about what I
did -"
800,EMILY,800,"Mom. You're getting your tears all over
me. When am I gonna be able to feel my
face?"
801,TERRY,801,"You gave us quite a scare there, Scout."
802,EMILY,802,Scout?
803,TERRY,803,Come on. I call you that all the time.
804,EMILY,804,No. Not since I was a grown up.
805,TERRY,805,I've called you that your whole life!
806,NURSE JUDY,806,Sorry hon.
807,EMILY,807,What is that crap?
808,NURSE JUDY,808,"We have to thicken your liquids for a
bit. Your esophagus isn't strong enough
to swallow yet."
809,EMILY,809,That shit tastes like semen.
810,TERRY,810,That's nice for a father to hear.
811,DR. CUNNINGHAM,811,"She won't have any social inhibitions
until the anesthetic wears off."
812,EMILY,812,"It does! Seriously, Mom. You should try
this."
813,BETH,813,"Oh wait a minute, honey!"
814,TERRY,814,"Oh, come on, come on. They'll charge us
forty eight dollars for it, don't worry
about it."
815,EMILY,815,Why are you here?
816,KUMAIL,816,I haven't heard her voice in a while.
817,BETH,817,He's been here the whole time.
818,DR. CUNNINGHAM,818,Could I speak with you both outside?
819,BETH,819,"Honey, we'll be right outside."
820,KUMAIL,820,Hey.
821,DR. CUNNINGHAM,821,"Emily has a rare condition called Adult
Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned
Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling
still hadn't gone down even after
several days in bed, which is strange.
Still's disease is when the body thinks
healthy tissue is an infection so it
tries to fight it. It's like a big
biological misunderstanding."
822,TERRY,822,"Yeah, yeah."
823,DR CUNNINGHAM,823,"We gave her anti-inflammatories and she
stabilized within hours. She's gonna
take time to recover but she'll be
fine."
824,TERRY,824,Wow.
825,EMILY,825,What are you doing here?
826,KUMAIL,826,"I was visiting someone down the hall and
I was like, I'll just pop in and say hi
to Emily."
827,EMILY,827,Oh.
828,KUMAIL,828,"No, I'm joking, I was here for you."
829,EMILY,829,You're an asshole and I don't like you.
830,KUMAIL,830,I'm not an asshole. I'm really not.
831,EMILY,831,"No, you're an asshole."
832,KUMAIL,832,"You have a lot of drugs in you so you're
not thinking as clearly."
833,EMILY,833,"Naw dog. I'm not joking. You're not funny
to me. You just make me sad. You make me
sad inside of my heart, and it makes me
sad to look at you. So I think you should
probably go. Just go and tell my mom I
want her."
834,EMILY (CONT'D),834,Will you please get my mom?
835,KUMAIL,835,Emily wants to see you.
836,KUMAIL (CONT'D),836,"I'm gonna head out. I don't think I
should be here."
837,TERRY,837,"Alright, Kumail. Here's the thing. Your
living condition is a potential health
risk and you're not that funny. But....
you're probably not suited to do
anything else either so that's
troublesome--"
838,KUMAIL,838,"You really made it sound like you were
going to say something positive there."
839,TERRY,839,"I guess I did, didn't I? You know I
know the good stuff. You know how I
feel. I gotta get in there."
840,KUMAIL,840,"So you gonna hang around Chicago for a
while?"
841,BETH,841,Yeah. She's got physical therapy.
842,KUMAIL,842,"Did you ever think you'd be excited to
have your daughter go through physical
therapy?"
843,KUMAIL,843,"It's so strange that we could go
through one of the most intense
experiences of our lives together and
just never see each other again."
844,BETH,844,Maybe. But I hope not.
845,MARY,845,"Hi little sad man. Mopey boy. We have
something to tell you. We are moving to
New York. And we want you to come with
us."
846,MARY,846,He will be fine.
847,CJ,847,"There's not enough room in the car,
probably. We leave in a week, all
right? And I already called shotgun
Chicago to Pittsburgh. Do not fuck this
up."
848,MARY,848,Your destiny awaits!
849,CJ,849,"This will be the biggest move of your
life. Other than the one from Pakistan."
850,TERRY,850,"Hey, clink clink! Thank you everybody
for coming. I just wanted to say a
couple of words here."
851,EMILY,851,Why is Kumail here?
852,BETH,852,"Cause he was there the whole time. I
invited the nurses, I invited him."
853,TERRY,853,"Emily, come on up here. I wanna say
something."
854,TERRY (CONT'D),854,"Emily successfully peeled an orange
this morning."
855,TERRY (CONT'D),855,"It was a clementine, full disclosure,
it's those little ones that a baby
monkey could peel, but she did it. And
that's all, thank you everybody."
856,KUMAIL,856,"Hey. I like your cane. I've heard
pimpin' ain't easy."
857,EMILY,857,Right.
858,KUMAIL,858,"Hey, can we talk for a second?"
859,EMILY,859,Sure.
860,KUMAIL,860,"So, I've been collecting some things
that are important to me and I wanted
to show them to you. I call this my bag
of devotion."
861,KUMAIL (CONT'D),861,"This is all the visitor passes from
when I visited you when you were in the-"
862,KUMAIL (CONT'D),862,"These are the ticket stubs from when
your parents came to see me perform and
I realized how great they are, and how
great you are, and how great honesty
is."
863,EMILY,863,"What did you do? Did you cremate
someone?"
864,KUMAIL,864,"These are the ashes of all the
Pakistani women - not the women - the
pictures of the Pakistani women. I
thought this was a good idea, but it
feels a little stupid."
865,KUMAIL (CONT'D),865,"I know I was a terrible boyfriend. But
I've changed. And I am the person you
need me to be. I really am. So, will
you take me back?"
866,EMILY,866,"Kumail, I'm really glad that you went
through this experience, but you have
to understand that all that happened
while I was asleep. Like you felt one
way a few weeks ago and now you're
saying you feel the total opposite way
and the only thing that's changed is
that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look
at all of this, and I just think, I
can't do it again. I can't be the
reason that you don't have a family. It
just feels totally different now. And I
can't do that again. Do you understand?"
867,KUMAIL,867,Okay.
868,KUMAIL,868,"Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. There's no
plate. Oh I forgot. I've decided I
won't let you kick me out of the
family. Since I am a member of the
family, it would stand to reason that I
would get a vote in whether or not I
get kicked out, and that vote would
have to be unanimous. Standard
parliamentary procedure. So all those
in favor of not kicking Kumail out of
the family, raise your hand."
869,KUMAIL (CONT'D),869,"Great. Motion to kick Kumail out of the
family, denied. So you guys can just
talk to me."
870,KUMAIL (CONT'D),870,"Okay, you're giving me the silent
treatment. I figured that was what was
going to happen. I have a solution."
871,KUMAIL (CONT'D),871,"""Hi. How are you?"" It's just a real
basic one. ""Pass the salt."" Practical.
""Always with the comedy."" Mom, made
that one specially for you. ""Kumail,
how did you become so much more
handsome than your brother Naveed?"""
872,NAVEED,872,Bullshit.
873,KUMAIL,873,"I admit this one is designed to stir up
some controversy. ""It's interesting how
you can't really kick someone out of your
family because they'll always be your
family."" I agree with that one. It's a
good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here
for you."
874,KUMAIL (CONT'D),874,"I'm sorry I lied about the girls and
the LSAT and all of that. That was
wrong. And one more thing: I'm moving
to New York to pursue stand-up, but I
am not leaving this family."
875,KUMAIL (V.O.),875,"My parents want me to get arrange
married. Or as it's called in Pakistan,
romance! Earlier today, I told them
everything. I told them about my life. I
told them about Emily. They kicked me out
of the family. I may never talk to them
again. So that happened -"
876,EMILY,876,What is it?
877,BETH (O.S.),877,Can I come in?
878,EMILY,878,Okay.
879,KUMAIL (CONT'D),879,"The only time I've cried that much is
when I watched the first 15 minutes of
Up. This is a picture of me and my
mother. I'm seven years old."
880,TERRY,880,"You know people talk about New York
water but Chicago water is very
underrated, I think. It's good."
881,EMILY,881,"Hey guys, I think I might just pop out
for a bit."
882,TERRY,882,By yourself?
883,EMILY,883,"Yeah, just hop around the block, maybe
get some frozen yogurt."
884,TERRY,884,"Are you okay? Can you do it, can you walk
by yourself?"
885,EMILY,885,"Yeah, Dad."
886,BETH,886,Have fun.
887,TERRY,887,"If you feel a coma coming on, call us."
888,EMILY,888,"Dad, it's too soon. I love you, I'll see
you in the morning."
889,TERRY,889,"Love you, bye."
890,BETH,890,Have fun.
891,EMILY,891,I will.
892,TERRY,892,Got your phone?
893,EMILY,893,Yeah.
894,KUMAIL,894,"But you liked it, huh?"
895,NAVEED,895,"Yeah. I mean, yeah."
896,KUMAIL,896,Hey!
897,EMILY,897,Hi...
898,KUMAIL,898,What are you doing here?
899,EMILY,899,"I was in the neighborhood and I saw
that you were gonna be here so I
thought I'd come say hi."
900,KUMAIL,900,"You look great. How's your blood oxygen
level?"
901,EMILY,901,"Oh, well within range."
902,KUMAIL,902,Nice.
903,KUMAIL (CONT'D),903,"Uh, this is my brother, Naveed."
904,EMILY,904,"Hi, I'm Emily."
905,NAVEED,905,I've heard lots about you.
906,EMILY,906,It's so good to finally meet you.
907,EMILY,907,"There's actually something I wanted to
tell you."
908,NAVEED,908,"Okay, well I'm going to just... goodbye."
909,BETH,909,Are you warm enough?
910,TERRY,910,"Yeah, yeah. I've got my two pairs of
socks on."
911,BETH,911,Do you mind?
912,TERRY,912,No... no...
913,BETH,913,I'm glad we're going home tomorrow.
914,TERRY,914,"Me too. See? I should have brushed my
teeth."
915,BETH,915,I like it.
916,EMILY,916,"When something like this happens,
there's this sort of expectation that
you're going to have this completely
new lease on life and feel totally
different about everything. Like
cherish every sunrise. And for the most
part I just feel like, ugh I can't get
up that early. I'm sorry, I feel like
I've been talking about myself so much.
Are you doing a lot of stand-up?"
917,KUMAIL,917,"Yeah, I bombed my Montreal Comedy
Festival audition, like horrifically."
918,EMILY,918,"I saw the video. It wasn't great. I'll be
honest with you, it wasn't great."
919,KUMAIL,919,I know.
920,EMILY,920,"But there was a lot I liked. Like a lot I
liked."
921,KUMAIL,921,I'm moving to New York.
922,EMILY,922,Really?
923,KUMAIL,923,"Yeah. Mary and CJ and I are just gonna
drive out. We have a place already."
924,EMILY,924,When do you leave?
925,KUMAIL,925,Next weekend.
926,EMILY,926,"I'm so excited for you. That is great.
I think you are going to do so great in
New York."
927,KUMAIL,927,What were you going to say?
928,EMILY,928,What?
929,KUMAIL,929,"You said you were going to say something
to me. What was it?"
930,EMILY,930,"Oh, just that I wanted to thank you. My
parents told me everything you did for me
and I feel like the last time we spoke I
didn't properly thank you so-"
931,KUMAIL,931,Oh yeah. Totally fine.
932,EMILY,932,I should probably go.
933,KUMAIL,933,Do you wanna call an Uber?
934,EMILY,934,"No, I'm gonna walk actually. This has
been really great. Okay, bye."
935,CHRIS,935,"The scene is gonna be so different with
you guys gone."
936,KUMAIL,936,You should... come out...
937,CHRIS,937,Nah. I'm good here. I'm gonna miss you.
938,KUMAIL,938,I'm gonna miss you.
939,CHRIS,939,"Get out of here, you assholes."
940,MARY,940,"Come here, you big dummy."
941,AZMAT,941,"You are still kicked out of the family,
but because we did not get a proper
chance to say bye to you... Your mother
is so angry with you. She is not going
to get out of the car. She's not even
going to look at you. And I don't
believe you kept so much secret from
me, your father."
942,KUMAIL,942,I'm sorry.
943,AZMAT,943,Here. She asked me to give this to you.
944,AZMAT (CONT'D),944,"Biryani. For your trip. Your favorite.
She made it herself specially for you
with extra potatoes."
945,KUMAIL,945,Thank you Ma.
946,KUMAIL (CONT'D),946,Is she okay?
947,AZMAT,947,Right now? No.
948,KUMAIL,948,I'll miss you.
949,AZMAT,949,"I am forbidden from hugging you. So. It
was nice to have you as my son. Goodbye
forever. And do me a favor, when you
reach New York, just text us and tell
us that you've reached safely, okay?"
950,KUMAIL,950,"Dad, can I ask you something? When you
and Mom went on your first date, what
movie did you see?"
951,AZMAT,951,Satte pe Satta.
952,AZMAT (CONT'D),952,Her favorite song. Why are you asking?
953,KUMAIL,953,Just curious.
954,KUMAIL,954,"So the first time I came to America, I
was fourteen and I was just visiting my
uncle in New York and it just happened
to be Thanksgiving. On my first day in
America, my uncle took me to the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade and I was like,
this is every day in America! As
advertised. Every day they have a party
celebrating Garfield. No day has lived
up to that day. So I was lying to my
parents, I was telling them I was gonna
be a lawyer. And they're very
disappointed cause they wanted me to be
a doctor. And you guys are like, why
didn't you just tell them that you
wanted to be a doctor?"
955,KUMAIL (CONT'D),955,"It's a lie anyway. And I'm like, well it
has to be believable. If I told them I
want to be a doctor, they'd be like,
""bullshit."" If I say lawyer, they're
like, ""oh, ok, that's something."" Cause
there's a strict hierarchy: doctor,
engineer, lawyer, hundreds of jobs,
ISIS, then comedian."
956,KUMAIL (CONT'D),956,"Uhh. I'm sorry. It's very rude to
heckle comedians."
957,EMILY,957,"Oh that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of
woo-hooed you."
958,KUMAIL,958,"Well see that's a common misconception.
Heckling doesn't have to be negative."
959,EMILY,959,"So if I was like, oh my god, you're
amazing in bed! That would be a heckle?"
960,KUMAIL,960,"Yeah, and now you're getting more laughs
than me, and I don't like that. Do you
want to come up, do my job? Are you from
out of town, m'am?"
961,EMILY,961,Chicago.
962,KUMAIL,962,"Ooh Windy City. And what brings you to
New York?"
963,EMILY,963,I'm here to see someone.
964,KUMAIL,964,"And have you seen him? Or her, I mean I
don't know what your deal is."
965,EMILY,965,"Yeah, I've seen him."
