0,BOBBY,0,Get off the goddamn road!
1,BOBBY,1,Fuck you!
2,BOBBY,2,No!...Not now!...Shit!
3,BOBBY,3,Oh shit!
4,BOBBY,4,You Harlin?
5,DARRELL,5,Nope.  Darrell.
6,BOBBY,6,Harlin around?
7,DARRELL,7,He's up at the Look Out.
8,BOBBY,8,Will he be back soon?
9,DARRELL,9,"Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a
cemetery."
10,BOBBY,10,You own this place?
11,DARRELL,11,Yep.
12,BOBBY,12,Then why do you call it Harlin's?
13,DARRELL,13,'Cause Harlin used to own it.
14,BOBBY,14,But he's dead.
15,DARRELL,15,So?
16,BOBBY,16,"You want to take a look at my car?  I think
the radiator hose is--"
17,DARRELL,17,"Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
Sometimes I don't even want to get out of
bed. Course don't want to get out for the
cold one's neither.  Then of course the
clouds come in..."
18,BOBBY,18,"Look, Harlin, I've got places to be."
19,DARRELL,19,Darrell--
20,BOBBY,20,"OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look
at my radiator hose.  It's busted."
21,BOBBY,21,So?
22,DARRELL,22,It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
23,BOBBY,23,"I know it's busted.  What did I just tell
you?"
24,DARRELL,24,"Well, you know so much why don't you just
fix it yourself?"
25,BOBBY,25,"If I could do you think I'd be standing
here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or
do I have to go somewhere else?"
26,DARRELL,26,"Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is
fifty miles from here. Only other gas
station down in town closed 3 years ago
when the mine got shut..."
27,BOBBY,27,"Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you
fix it, or not?"
28,DARRELL,28,"Yeah, I can fix it."
29,BOBBY,29,Great!
30,DARRELL,30,"Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can
find a hose like this one, or close enough.
Gonna take time."
31,BOBBY,31,How much time?
32,DARRELL,32,Time.
33,BOBBY (rewinds his watch),33,What time is it now?
34,DARRELL,34,Twenty-after-ten.
35,BOBBY,35,"Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be
ninety already."
36,DARRELL,36,"Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now
might be seventy-two. These clouds move
around a lot."
37,DARRELL,37,What happened to your hand?
38,BOBBY,38,Accident.
39,DARRELL,39,"You got to be more careful. Hands is
important.  Let me show you something. When
I was a kid, now I don't know if you can
still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a
lawnmower."
40,BOBBY,40,"I'm very interested in this but is there
someplace..."
41,DARRELL,41,"Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple
folk like it."
42,BOBBY,42,"I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be
careful with her, will you?"
43,DARRELL,43,Just a car.
44,BOBBY,44,"It's not just a car. It's a sixty-four and
half Mustang convertible. That's the
difference between you and me, and why you
live here and I'm just passing through."
45,BOBBY,45,"Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff
out of the trunk."
46,BLIND MAN,46,Hey!  You there!
47,BOBBY,47,"You want something, old man?"
48,BLIND MAN,48,"Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got
no respect, boy?"
49,BOBBY,49,You want something?
50,BLIND MAN,50,"Yeah I want something.  I want you to run
over to that machine and get me a pop."
51,BOBBY,51,You can't do that yourself?
52,BLIND MAN,52,"Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm
blind.  Can't you see that?"
53,BOBBY,53,"I'm sorry, I didn't--"
54,BLIND MAN,54,"What'd you think I was doing out here
with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?"
55,BOBBY,55,"I don't know.  I thought you were keeping
the sun out of your eyes."
56,BLIND MAN,56,I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
57,BOBBY,57,Christ no!
58,BLIND MAN,58,"Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them
fighting the commies.  Fought the war and
lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so
you can come around here and make fun of
me."
59,BOBBY,59,I said I was sorry.
60,BLIND MAN,60,"Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and
get me my pop before I die of thirst."
61,BOBBY,61,"Yeah, sure.  You got change?"
62,BLIND MAN,62,"Change?  You want my change?  I fought the
war and lost my eyes just so I could give
you my change?"
63,BOBBY,63,"All right, old man.  Christ."
64,BLIND MAN,64,"Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Colas.
Colas ain't nothing but flavored water."
65,BLIND MAN,65,"Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be
opening my own bottle."
66,BOBBY,66,Christ!
67,BLIND MAN,67,"A little for Mother Earth. I'm about fifty
percent Indian, you know. To all our
relations."
68,BLIND MAN,68,Ah!  Just what I needed!  Want some?
69,BOBBY,69,I'll pass.
70,BOBBY,70,"I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.
He looks sick."
71,BLIND MAN,71,That's 'cause he's dead.
72,BOBBY,72,"Oh, Jesus."
73,BLIND MAN,73,"I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was
you?"
74,BOBBY,74,"What the hell are you keeping a dead dog
around for?"
75,BLIND MAN,75,"He's only just dead.  What was I supposed
to do with him?  I can't take him away
anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for
me.  Do you?"
76,BOBBY,76,Hell no!
77,BLIND MAN,77,"See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him
here beside me.  That's where he belongs
anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not
anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals
since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was
just a pup then... a companion that's
loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no
matter how much you kick him...I miss him.
(as Bobby moves away) I'll see ya later,
unless I come across something worse."
78,BOBBY,78,"Can I give you a hand, beautiful?"
79,GRACE,79,I'm just going to my car?
80,BOBBY,80,That's right on my way.
81,GRACE,81,"My mother told me never to accept offers
from strangers."
82,BOBBY,82,"My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger
anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get
to know each other, beautiful?"
83,GRACE,83,Do you have to call me that?
84,BOBBY,84,I don't know your real name.
85,GRACE,85,Maybe I don't want you to.
86,BOBBY,86,"Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would
have kept on walking."
87,GRACE,87,"You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?"
88,BOBBY,88,"I like that about me, beautiful."
89,GRACE,89,It's Grace.
90,BOBBY,90,"May I carry your package, Grace?"
91,BOBBY,91,Jesus.
92,GRACE,92,You sure you can manage?
93,BOBBY,93,I got it.
94,GRACE,94,Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
95,BOBBY,95,No!
96,BOBBY,96,"No, I've got it."
97,GRACE,97,What happened to your hand?
98,BOBBY,98,Accident.
99,GRACE,99,You should be more careful.
100,GRACE,100,"It's very nice of you to help me.  That
package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot."
101,BOBBY,101,"No trouble at all, really."
102,BOBBY,102,Wasn't nothing.
103,GRACE,103,"Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.
I should have parked closer.  I just didn't
think it would be so heavy.  I could drive
up."
104,BOBBY,104,That's all right.  I got it.
105,GRACE,105,"It's just new drapes and curtain rods.  If
I had known it was going to be so heavy I
would have had them delivered up to the
house."
106,BOBBY (panting),106,That a fact?
107,GRACE,107,"I just got tired of looking at the old
drapes. My mother made them. Had them long
as I can remember. You ever seen something
and just knew you had to have it?"
108,BOBBY (straining),108,"Yes, I have."
109,GRACE,109,"'Course they cost a little more than I
should really be spending.  But, damn it, I
don't hardly ever do anything nice for
myself.  I deserve nice things."
110,BOBBY (can hardly talk),110,I ... can't ... argue ...
111,GRACE,111,This is it.
112,GRACE,112,"Thank you, Bobby."
113,BOBBY,113,"You're welcome, Grace."
114,GRACE,114,"You're not from around here, are you?"
115,BOBBY,115,"Why you say that?  Just because I help a
lady with her package?"
116,GRACE,116,"You don't have that dead look in your eyes
like the only thing you live for is to get
through the day."
117,BOBBY,117,I just drove in this morning.
118,GRACE,118,Drove into Superior?  What for?
119,BOBBY,119,"Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up
the road."
120,GRACE,120,"You're lucky you didn't break down in the
desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no
time. When you leaving?"
121,BOBBY,121,"Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how
long that's going to take."
122,GRACE,122,And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
123,SHERIFF,123,Morning Grace.
124,GRACE,124,Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
125,SHERIFF,125,"Well it's about time. Looks like you found
yourself a helper too."
126,GRACE,126,"Well, he offered, and I just couldn't
refuse. His car overheated."
127,SHERIFF,127,Oh?
128,BOBBY,128,"Morning, officer."
129,SHERIFF,129,Son.
130,SHERIFF,130,"Little excitement out at the reservation
this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were
up drinking all night and then Wayne starts
chasing Dale around the desert with his
shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for
backup."
131,GRACE,131,Anybody hurt?
132,SHERIFF,132,"Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's
sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he
didn't kill his own danged self."
133,SHERIFF,133,"Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting
you, son."
134,BOBBY,134,"Same here, officer."
135,GRACE,135,"Well, I guess I could use some help
getting this box into the house.  Not far.
You could shower, get something cool to
drink."
136,BOBBY,136,"Well, I could use something cool."
137,GRACE,137,Where you coming from?
138,BOBBY,138,"All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just
lately Dallas."
139,GRACE,139,You've been around.
140,BOBBY,140,I guess I've got wander in my blood.
141,GRACE,141,Where you headed?
142,BOBBY,142,"I don't know.  I have to make a stop in
Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe
I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be
able to pick up some action there."
143,GRACE,143,"So, what is it you do, Mister...?"
144,BOBBY,144,"Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever
pays best. Little bartending, used to teach
tennis, played a little competition ...
(drops it)."
145,GRACE,145,"I never played tennis. You just travel
around Bobby-- no direction, no steady
work.  You must like taking chances."
146,BOBBY,146,"If you're going to gamble, might as well
play for high stakes."
147,GRACE,147,What happens when you lose?
148,BOBBY,148,I pack up and go somewhere else.
149,GRACE (wistfully),149,"Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere
else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the
State Fair. It was nice, but it wasn't
nothing."
150,BOBBY,150,"I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.
I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do,
and get out."
151,GRACE,151,Sometimes I feel the exact same way.
152,VOICE(V.O.),152,I want my money.
153,VOICE(V.O.),153,I want my money.
154,BOBBY,154,"Look, I'll get the money! You don't want to
do this!"
155,VOICE (V.O.),155,"Take two for now. One a week, punk..."
156,VOICE (V.O.),156,"Two weeks, asshole. Get the money or you
gonna lose your nose and ears."
157,BOBBY (to himself),157,You're still lucky.
158,GRACE,158,Thought you might like a refill on your lemonade.
159,BOBBY,159,"That's good.  Cools you right off.
(tentatively) I saw you watching me."
160,GRACE,160,I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
161,BOBBY,161,I didn't say it bothered me.
162,GRACE,162,Did you like it; me watching you?
163,BOBBY,163,I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
164,GRACE,164,"Good, 'cause I liked what I saw."
165,BOBBY,165,Nice place.
166,GRACE,166,Thank you.
167,BOBBY,167,"Who's that, your father?"
168,GRACE (without much thought),168,Stepfather...
169,BOBBY (coy),169,Got a boyfriend?
170,GRACE,170,No. Not really.
171,BOBBY,171,"Must get kind of lonely for a woman living
by herself in a big house."
172,GRACE,172,I guess it must.
173,BOBBY,173,What do you do anyway?
174,GRACE,174,"A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly
I tell fortunes."
175,BOBBY,175,Where'd you learn to do that?
176,GRACE,176,From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
177,BOBBY,177,A medicine man?
178,GRACE,178,"Those are white words, not ours."
179,BOBBY,179,"Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You
must be good."
180,GRACE,180,Come here.
181,GRACE,181,"There's something in your past; something
you want to keep hidden.  There's a pain.
Something ... someone you can't forget.
And there is something you want very badly.
It seems very far away to you, but you are
determined, and you will do what you must
to get it."
182,BOBBY,182,My face tell you all that?
183,GRACE,183,"It tells me what every face tells me.
Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and
they have something they want.
(seductively) What is it you want?"
184,BOBBY,184,The same thing you do.
185,GRACE,185,Really?  I want to hang drapes.
186,GRACE,186,Hold me.
187,GRACE,187,"Tighter.  I won't break. You know girls are
a lot tougher than men think."
188,GRACE,188,There.  All done.  Lift me down.
189,BOBBY,189,What?
190,GRACE,190,Lift me down.
191,GRACE,191,"You can let go of me now. I'm safe.(with
a wicked smile) How do they look?"
192,BOBBY,192,Like you.
193,GRACE,193,Beautiful?
194,BOBBY (kidding),194,Like they're made of polyester.
195,GRACE,195,"I like them.  I was sick of looking at this
room.  I think they add a little life."
196,BOBBY,196,Nothing like a little liveliness.
197,GRACE,197,"No more drapes to hang.  Now what should
we do?"
198,BOBBY,198,I have an idea.
199,GRACE,199,And what would that be?
200,BOBBY,200,"All right, Grace.  No more games."
201,GRACE (innocently),201,Games?
202,BOBBY,202,"You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You
lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go
for being jerked around."
203,GRACE,203,"Really?  And what game did you want to
play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall
into bed with you?"
204,BOBBY,204,"I think I can find my own way back to
into town."
205,GRACE,205,"Maybe I like to find out about a man first.
Maybe I like to know what he's made of."
206,BOBBY,206,"I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a
few memories of bad women; just like most
guys.  But you already know that.  You read
my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade."
207,GRACE,207,You never did answer my question.
208,BOBBY,208,Still playing?
209,GRACE,209,That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
210,BOBBY,210,You know what I want.
211,GRACE,211,Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
212,JAKE (O.S.),212,Grace!
213,GRACE (nonplussed),213,Jake.  I thought you...
214,JAKE,214,Who the hell is this!?
215,BOBBY,215,Who the hell are you?
216,JAKE,216,I'm her husband.
217,BOBBY (shocked whisper),217,Husband ...?
218,JAKE,218,"Now who the hell are you, and it better be
good, or God help me I'll break you in
half."
219,BOBBY,219,"Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife.
I met her in town.  She needed a hand with
her drapes.  That's all."
220,JAKE,220,"Didn't much look like you were hanging
drapes."
221,BOBBY,221,"I swear to you that's all that happened.  I
haven't so much as set foot in your
bedroom."
222,JAKE,222,A lot that means.
223,BOBBY,223,"Grace, tell him."
224,BOBBY,224,"Damn it, Grace!  Tell him."
225,GRACE (coyly),225,"If he says that's what happened, Jake, it
must be true."
226,JAKE,226,"Oh yeah, and I suppose you didn't have
anything to do with it Grace, he just
wandered up here by hisself. I got a mind
to put you over my knee and paddle your
ass"
227,BOBBY (to Grace),227,"You bitch! Is this what it's all about? You
sucker me up here so you can watch the two
of us beat the shit out of each other over
you? You both... Forget it! (heads for the
door)"
228,JAKE,228,Where you going!
229,BOBBY (exiting),229,"'Scuse me, you want to take my head off,
mister. I won't even try to stop you. I
deserve it for being an idiot. But if
you're not, I think I'll be on my way...
Ow!"
230,JAKE,230,"You can't just walk in here and walk out,
you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new
asshole!"
231,BOBBY,231,You broke my nose!
232,JAKE,232,It ain't broke.
233,BOBBY,233,"Goddamn it! I'm... you're lucky I don't sue
you."
234,JAKE (opens the door),234,Get goin' Junior.
235,BOBBY,235,You people are crazy!
236,BOBBY,236,Fuckin' shithole!
237,BOBBY,237,What the fuck do you want?
238,JAKE,238,"I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be
walking... People die out here, y'know."
239,JAKE,239,"Aw, you're not still upset about that love
tap, are you? If I meant you real trouble,
I'd have given it to you by now. Get in,
lad. Come on. Get in."
240,JAKE,240,"After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I
got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants
to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it
instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that.
It's a funny thing, women."
241,BOBBY,241,Yeah...
242,JAKE,242,"Say, what happened to your hand?"
243,BOBBY,243,Accident.
244,JAKE,244,You've got to be--
245,BOBBY,245,"Yeah, I know.  More careful."
246,JAKE,246,"I guess we've never been introduced proper.
Jake McKenna."
247,BOBBY,247,That's a solid name.
248,JAKE,248,I'm a solid man.
249,BOBBY,249,Bobby Cooper.
250,JAKE,250,"""Bobby Cooper."" What brings you to
Superior, Coop?"
251,BOBBY,251,An overheated car.
252,JAKE,252,Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
253,BOBBY,253,Darrell's a moron.
254,JAKE (laughs),254,"Yeah, he sure is a character. You need any
help with that car now?... Where you
headed?"
255,BOBBY,255,California...
256,JAKE,256,Live there?
257,BOBBY,257,"Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.
Wants me to sail it for him."
258,JAKE,258,"You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.
Drive across the country, step on a boat
and just sail away.  A man could pretty
well disappear like that.  Just sail away
until all he was was a memory.  I guess a
little place like this would just be a dot
on a map to you after awhile."
259,BOBBY,259,"I hope so. (beat) Listen, McKenna about
your wife:  If I had known she was
married--"
260,JAKE,260,"It wouldn't have made a difference to you,
now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why?
Because you're a man without scruples."
261,BOBBY,261,Wait a second--
262,JAKE,262,"Ah, I can smell it on you."
263,BOBBY,263,Hey!
264,JAKE,264,"That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an
honest bone in his body.  Don't be
offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics
is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how
can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a
mind of her own, and a body to match, don't
she?  Eh?"
265,JAKE,265,"She does at that.  I knew when I married
her she was a free spirit.  A woman with
her looks and a man my age; what was I to
expect?  But you see a woman like that in a
town like this and you don't think, you do.
So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?
Women."
266,BOBBY,266,"Can't live with them, and you can't shoot
'em."
267,JAKE,267,"""You can't shoot 'em!"" I like that.
(laughs) I bet she led you on good, didn't
she?  Taking you up to the house to hang
drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had
you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your
face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down
her pants and hog her out. Then me busting
in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a
fire going under you."
268,BOBBY,268,Like you don't know.
269,JAKE,269,"Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I
can tell you got a temper on you."
270,JAKE,270,"Bet you just wanted to snap her neck right
then, didn't you?  Bet you just wanted to
kill her."
271,JAKE,271,Would you?
272,BOBBY,272,Would I what?
273,JAKE,273,Would you kill her?
274,JAKE,274,"Because I'm sick and tired of her little
games.  Because you could do it and drift
away on your boat and no one would ever see
you again.  Because I've got a
fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy
on her, and I would be more than happy to
give the man who does her in a good chunk
of it."
275,BOBBY,275,"I've done a few things but I'm not a
murderer, Mr. McKenna."
276,JAKE,276,How do you know if you've never tried?
277,BOBBY,277,"This is a joke, right?  You just want to
rattle me.  Right?"
278,JAKE,278,"That's right.  Nothing but a joke.  That's
all."
279,JAKE,279,"Enjoy your stay, lad."
280,BOBBY,280,Who
281,BOBBY,281,Got any cold soda?
282,WOMAN,282,Eh?
283,BOBBY,283,Soda.  You got any soda?
284,WOMAN,284,"Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es
bien."
285,BOBBY,285,Soda.  You know.
286,WOMAN,286,Oh.  Something to eat.  Si.
287,BOBBY,287,"Not eat.  Drink.  What the fuck is drink in
Spanish ... uh, agua?"
288,BIKER,288,"That's right, lady.  Keep it in you and
nobody gets hurt.  That goes for you too,
stud.  Gimmie the money.  Now!"
289,WOMAN,289,Eh?
290,SECOND BIKER,290,"The dinero, Senora.  Hand it over."
291,BIKER,291,"That's it?  Lady, I got kids to put through
school."
292,WOMAN,292,Es all I have.
293,BIKER,293,"Okay, pal.  Whatcha got? Give it, now."
294,"BIKER (thumbing through it, impressed)",294,Nice...Just who
295,"BIKER (thumbing through it, impressed)",295,else you got for papa?
296,BIKER,296,"Better...you're getting tasty. Now toss the
bag, sweetie."
297,BOBBY,297,It's just books.
298,BIKER,298,I'm a reader. Toss it.
299,BOBBY (an entreaty),299,It's personal things...family things.
300,BIKER,300,"How touching...I like family values. Give
it to me."
301,BOBBY,301,No.
302,BIKER,302,No?
303,SECOND BIKER,303,"Hey man, forget it. Come on."
304,BIKER,304,No?
305,WOMAN,305,"Senor, give him the bag."
306,BIKER,306,"That's all right. He doesn't want to give
me the bag..."
307,SECOND BIKER,307,He's fucking with you man. Shoot him.
308,BIKER (cont'd),308,...he doesn't have to give me the bag.
309,SECOND BIKER,309,"Let's go, man."
310,BIKER,310,"A little extra never hurt, Benji, would you
just relax."
311,WOMAN,311,No!  No! My wedding ring.
312,BIKER,312,Now we go.
313,WOMAN,313,You go to El Diablo!
314,SECOND BIKER,314,Bugger! You bitch!
315,WOMAN (cursing in Spanish),315,"Hijos de puta. Bayan a comer su propia
mierda en el infierno. (TRANSLATION: Sons
of bitches. Go eat your own shit in hell)."
316,WOMAN,316,I call the sheriff.
317,BOBBY,317,No! No police.
318,WOMAN,318,A hundred dollars? No police?
319,BOBBY,319,No police until I leave.
320,BOBBY,320,Hey.
321,DARRELL,321,"Hey, your ... what the hell happened to
you?"
322,BOBBY,322,Nothing.
323,DARRELL,323,Don't look like nothing.
324,BOBBY,324,Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
325,DARRELL,325,"Another accident?  You got to be more
careful."
326,BOBBY,326,What the hell happened to my car?
327,DARRELL,327,"Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear
through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like
a dream now."
328,BOBBY (suspicious),328,How much?
329,DARRELL,329,"Well ... you got your parts, you got your
labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty
bucks."
330,BOBBY,330,How much!?
331,DARRELL,331,Hundred-fifty.
332,BOBBY,332,To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
333,DARRELL,333,"A goddamn radiator hose in a
sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know
how long it took me to find that hose?"
334,BOBBY,334,"About an hour and a half, because that's
all the longer I've been gone."
335,DARRELL,335,"Actually, it's been about three hours.
You're the one thinks that car's so damn
fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn
prices?"
336,BOBBY,336,"That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to
tell me no one else in this shit hole
drives a Ford?"
337,DARRELL,337,"""That's not just a Ford, that's a
sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."""
338,BOBBY,338,What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
339,DARRELL,339,"I don't know, but ""it's the reason I'm living
here and you're just passing through.""  Now you
owe me a hundred-fifty dollars."
340,BOBBY,340,"It might as well be fifteen-hundred
dollars, because I don't have the money."
341,DARRELL,341,Then you ain't gonna have the car.
342,BOBBY,342,"Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago
for everything I had."
343,BOBBY,343,I've got five...six dollars.
344,DARRELL,344,"Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in
the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now
why don't you just take your American
Express Gold Card, and call that guy with
the big schnooz on TV and have him send you
the money lickity split."
345,BOBBY,345,I don't have a goddamn credit card.
346,DARRELL,346,"Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know
how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause
you're gonna have to work this one off."
347,BOBBY,347,"Look, I got a Movado.  It's worth at least
seven, eight hundred. You could sell it for
that."
348,DARRELL (studying it),348,"Who the hell to? Shit, can't see no
numbers."
349,BOBBY,349,"You don't need numbers.  That's why it's
expensive.  Look at the gold."
350,DARRELL,350,"...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't
worth a duck's fart (proffers his own
watch). This one here cost me $3.75 and
it's got every doodad you can imagine. No
sir I'll stick with this (walks away)."
351,BOBBY,351,"You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers
shut you down."
352,DARRELL,352,"You ain't got no credit card but you got a
lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't
you read the sign? It says..."
353,BOBBY,353,What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
354,DARRELL,354,I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
355,ED,355,"One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was
back in July of forty-seven. That afternoon
it dropped down to forty three! True story."
356,BOYD,356,"One time last year I remember it went from
98 to 23 same day. Wind, black clouds come
out like..."
357,BOBBY,357,You got a beer?
358,FLO,358,What kind?
359,BOBBY,359,Beck's.
360,FLO,360,"No Beck's. A-1, Coors..."
361,BOBBY,361,Heineken?
362,FLO,362,"No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got
Miller."
363,BOBBY,363,Genuine Draft?
364,FLO,364,"No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can
fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave
it."
365,BOBBY,365,I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
366,SHORT ORDER COOK,366,"Flo, cheeseburger bleedin'."
367,FLO,367,I'll be right back with that beer.
368,BOBBY,368,...and a waitress named Flo.  Christ.
369,BOBBY,369,Fucking cat.
370,JENNY,370,"Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the
juke?"
371,BOBBY,371,What?
372,JENNY,372,"I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a
quarter?"
373,JENNY,373,What happened to your hand?
374,BOBBY,374,"I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more
careful."
375,JENNY,375,Got any requests?
376,BOBBY,376,"That country shit all sounds the same to
me."
377,JENNY,377,How about I pick one out for you?
378,JENNY,378,"You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.
How come, I wonder, she don't put out no
more new records."
379,BOBBY,379,Cause she's dead.
380,JENNY,380,"Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?"
381,BOBBY,381,I've had time to get over it.
382,JENNY,382,"You're not from around here, are you?
Where you from?"
383,BOBBY,383,Oz.
384,JENNY,384,You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
385,BOBBY,385,You're too quick for me.
386,TOBY,386,"No....No....No I'm seeing but I'm not
believin'...Stop the wedding.  This can't
be. Hey!  What are you doing with my girl?"
387,TOBY,387,I axed you a question.
388,JENNY,388,"Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was
just talking."
389,TOBY,389,"You shut your mouth, girl, and get back
over to our table. (to Bobby) Now, I'm not
going to axe you again, Mister.  What were
you doing with my girl?"
390,BOBBY,390,I wasn't doing anything.
391,TOBY,391,"That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked
to me like you was trying to make time with
her."
392,BOBBY,392,"Make time?  Is everybody in this town on
drugs?"
393,JENNY,393,"Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a
quarter for the jukebox."
394,TOBY,394,"Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's
business to take care of. I ain't never
taken no drugs, mister, and ..."
395,BOBBY,395,"Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I
wasn't making a play for your girl."
396,TOBY,396,You expect me to believe that?
397,BOBBY,397,"I don't care what you believe as long as
you leave me alone."
398,TOBY,398,"Mister, I'm calling you out."
399,BOBBY,399,What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
400,FLO,400,"Toby, you go finish your soda and leave the
man alone."
401,TOBY (to Bobby),401,"You know who I am?  Toby N. Tucker.
Everyone round here call me TNT. You know
why?"
402,BOBBY,402,Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
403,TOBY,403,"'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I
go off, somebody gets hurt."
404,BOBBY,404,"Fine.  I was making time with your girl.
Now I'm scared to death and I learned my
lesson. Now can you go away?"
405,TOBY,405,"Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!"
406,BOBBY,406,"Christ, I don't believe this!"
407,TOBY,407,Stand up.
408,BOBBY,408,I wasn't hitting on your girl!
409,TOBY,409,"Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where
you sit."
410,FLO,410,"Toby, you stop it now! Can't you see he's
got a hurt hand?"
411,TOBY,411,"Don't you never mind, Flo.  This is gonna
be over real quick."
412,TOBY,412,"You're lucky, Mister.  Don't think it's
over.  I called you out and I'm gonna see
this through.  You hear me? (to Jenny)
Come on, girl.  I got half a mind to make
you walk home."
413,FLO,413,"My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil,
has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose."
414,SHERIFF,414,What was that all about?
415,FLO,415,"You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every
man he sees is after his Jenny."
416,SHERIFF,416,"More like Jenny is after every man she
sees."
417,FLO (to Bobby),417,"You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to
show off for his girl.  Give him a couple
of hours, he'll cool off.  Still want that
beer?"
418,"BOBBY (tense, seeing the Sheriff)",418,I'll take it to go.
419,ED,419,"How's it with you, Sheriff?"
420,SHERIFF,420,"Already started out bad.  Couple of bikers
from out of town tried to knock over
Jamilla's grocery store this morning. It
was a real shootout."
421,BOYD,421,What happened?
422,SHERIFF,422,The old witch killed 'em both.
423,ED,423,Holy shit!
424,FLO,424,Poor thing.  Is she all right?
425,SHERIFF,425,"Sure, when the sons of bitches tried to
steal her wedding ring. That's when she
started shooting.  Can't blame her.  The
ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Store's a mess."
426,BOYD,426,"It's the desert.  That's what it is.  The
desert makes everybody crazy.  Ain't that
right, Sheriff?  People go crazy out here."
427,ED,427,"Come on, Boyd.  I've got to make tracks.
That yogurt's got to make Santa Fe before
it spoils."
428,BOYD,428,Dr. Pepper don't have that problem.
429,FLO,429,"I can't open off-sale for you, sugar."
430,FLO,430,Let me get your change.
431,SHERIFF,431,"Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill
on the coffee."
432,FLO,432,"You be careful now, Virgil."
433,SHERIFF,433,Son of a bitch!
434,FLO,434,"Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are
you all right?"
435,SHERIFF,435,I think I burned my gun hand!
436,SHERIFF (Cont'd),436,"How 'bout we put something soft on it
later? (a look)"
437,FLO,437,"(quietly) I could put some butter on it,
hon'. (Her normal abrasive voice) It'd
serve you right, you asshole.  Put it under
some cold water. Joe, run get a mop and
clean this fuckin' mess up."
438,FLO,438,"Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the
nice man like that?  Sorry about that,
mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25. (gives
it to him) You try to have a nice day now,
would you?"
439,BOBBY,439,"Sure, I'll try."
440,BOBBY,440,"Cici?  Cici, it's Bobby...Bobby
Cooper...Yeah, look, I know it's been a
while, but I'm kind of in a
jam...yeah...One-hundred-fifty
dollars...That's a lie. I called you on
your birthday..Two years ago...I can't help
it if you didn't get the message. Cici,
honey, I don't want to argue. I need you to
wire me the money...Because they're fucking
going to"
441,BOBBY,441,"CD's...Yeah, well where's my Mr. Coffee.
Cici...Cici..."
442,BOBBY,442,Bitch. Cunt.
443,BOBBY,443,"73-11, this is Pluto. What's the line on
Dallas?"
444,GAMBLER'S VOICE,444,"Pluto. Fucking deadbeat. We head about
you. You owe ""the commie"" 13 dimes, why you
tryin' to get in my office? Lose this
fuckin' number."
445,BOBBY,445,Mike...Mike...you asshole.
446,GAMBLER'S VOICE,446,Mike who?
447,SERGEI,447,Da?
448,MR. ARKADY,448,"Sergei, what are you, a Neanderthal? How
many times do I have to tell you?  You
answer a phone ""hello,"" not ""da."""
449,SERGEI (nods yes),449,"Sorry, Mr. Arkady.(into phone)""Hello?"""
450,OPERATOR(V.O.),450,"I have a collect call from Bobby Cooper.
Will you accept the charges?"
451,SERGEI,451,"Mr. Arkady, deadbeat Cooper's calling."
452,SERGEI,452,He's calling collect.
453,MR. ARKADY (overly sweet),453,"Bobby, what a surprise.  I expected to be
seeing you, not talking to you over the
phone."
454,BOBBY,454,"I know, Mr. Arkadin. I know. I was on my
way to you, it's just ... what a day I've
had. I know I'm coming up with a highly
improbable story, and I know you're not
going to believe this, but this ...is..."
455,BOBBY,455,"had it. I was on my way to Vegas when my
car breaks down in the middle of nowhere."
456,MR. ARKADY,456,"That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame."
457,BOBBY,457,"And that's not the half of it, Mr.
Arkadin..."
458,MR. ARKADY,458,"""Arkady"""
459,BOBBY,459,"Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half
of it. I got your money, and I go into this
little grocery store in this hicktown to
get something to eat and then... well, it
gets"
460,MR. ARKADY,460,"...And let me guess.  This robber -- he
gets your money."
461,BOBBY,461,No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they
462,BOBBY,462,get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
463,MR. ARKADY,463,The old lady?
464,BOBBY,464,With a
465,BOBBY,465,"and... and the money in my bag gets all
shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is
left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?"
466,"MR. ARKADY (beat, dry)",466,"Pretty long, Bobby."
467,BOBBY,467,"Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta
there before the cops showed. So now I
don't have a cent to my name. I can't even
get my car out of the garage.  I tell you,
Mister... (pause) if it weren't for bad
luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at
all, you know? (beat, waits)  So, I was
wondering if you could wire me a hundred
fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of
this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a
Western Union thing.  And of course I'll
pay it back with the rest of the money."
468,MR. ARKADY(V.O.),468,Which you don't have.
469,BOBBY,469,"But which I can get. No problem. Look, I
can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's
worth 16 at least. I just need the 150,
uh..."
470,MR. ARKADY (pause),470,Where are you?
471,BOBBY (hopeful),471,"Uh...a little shithole in Arizona called
Superior. About 200 miles east of Phoenix."
472,"MR. ARKADY (pausing, V.O.)",472,"Superior, hunh?"
473,BOBBY(V.O.),473,"Yeah, if you could send it care of..."
474,MR. ARKADY,474,"...Now, let me get this straight. Two years
you give me problems with your fuckin'
payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand
dollars, you call me - collect - then ask
me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars
just so you can get your car fixed."
475,BOBBY(V.O.),475,A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
476,MR. ARKADY,476,"A hundred and ... Now you listen to me
you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if
you got hit by a truck and run over by a
steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand
dollars and"
477,MR. ARKADY,477,"you get it, or where from, but I want it on
my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what
real bad luck is."
478,MR. ARKADY,478,Do you understand me you little fuck?
479,BOBBY (snaps),479,"Oh, fuck you too!"
480,MR. ARKADY,480,What'd you say to me!
481,BOBBY,481,"Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the
strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of
strain here."
482,MR. ARKADY,482,"Bobby, you owed me that 'bread' 4 weeks
ago. Now you tell me you want another week.
That's 5 weeks, Bobby. That's also 5
fingers, cause you and I know it's a finger
a week Bobby. So you got balls. Good--now
you come here tomorrow and you talk to me
real nice and maybe I don't take the other
3 fingers you owe me, you see? Tomorrow --
and Bobby, don't make me come look for you,
okay...have nice day."
483,SERGEI (into phone),483,You got that? -- have nice day (hangs up).
484,MR. ARKADY,484,"The nerva that piece of shit! And look at
you, you Neanderthal -- don't you fuckin'
break pencils, you goombah!"
485,SOFIA,485,"Finger? What are you, a faggot? In my
country a man don't pay we cut off his
head."
486,MR. ARKADY,486,"Get your ass down to this Superior,
Arizona. Bring me this Bobby Cooper. I
don't think he got the lesson. This is your
last chance, Sergei."
487,SERGEI,487,Da.
488,OPERATOR(V.O.),488,Hello?
489,BOBBY,489,Hello?
490,OPERATOR(V.O.),490,Are you finished with your call?
491,BOBBY,491,Yeah.
492,OPERATOR(V.O.),492,"Please deposit an additional seventy-five
cents."
493,BOBBY,493,"Goddamn rat's ass fuck! Shit! Damn! Damn!
Damn!"
494,VOICE(V.O.),494,Thank you for using AT&T.
495,BOBBY,495,"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I hate this fuckin' town!
I hate it! Do you hear me?"
496,BOBBY,496,"Get me outta here, please.  I gotta get out
of this place."
497,JAKE,497,"What can I do for you, lad?"
498,BOBBY,498,I was hoping we could talk.
499,JAKE,499,Talk?  About what?
500,BOBBY,500,About things.  About your wife.
501,JAKE,501,Sweet Grace?  What about her?
502,BOBBY,502,About what you said this morning.
503,BOBBY,503,"You said you had an insurance policy out on
your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars."
504,JAKE,504,I do.
505,BOBBY,505,"You said you'd cut that up with the man who
did her in."
506,JAKE,506,I did?
507,BOBBY,507,"Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a
betting man. You want me to spell it out
for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in
on the money."
508,JAKE,508,"Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way
you're rambling on."
509,BOBBY,509,I'm not rambling.
510,JAKE,510,You're talking like a madman.
511,BOBBY,511,"Well then, I guess that qualifies me for
citizenship in this town. You're the one
brought it up. This morning. In your car."
512,JAKE,512,"Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband
gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody
dead."
513,BOBBY,513,Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
514,JAKE,514,"A man doesn't always mean the things he
says."
515,BOBBY,515,You meant it.
516,JAKE,516,What makes you say that?
517,BOBBY,517,"Because you're a slimy bastard who would
have his wife killed just to get his hands
on some money."
518,JAKE,518,And what does that make you?
519,BOBBY,519,"The slimy bastard who's going to do it for
you... (pause) You're a jealous man Jake.
If you can't have Grace to yourself...well,
you're not the sharing kind."
520,JAKE,520,"Well, I guess I have what you call a
love-hate relationship with Grace."
521,BOBBY,521,"You love her, but you hate her?"
522,JAKE,522,"No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of
person she is. I hate having to tolerate
the little ""games"" she plays. Like fucking
half of the town behind my back and
laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to
play. She wants me to hit her and when I
hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But
she's family. She's my little girl. My
baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes
roll back in her head as she sucks her last
breath, or to see her pretty pink brains
spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you?
You got the killing in you, boy...How much
you want?"
523,BOBBY,523,Make it twenty.
524,"JAKE (stressed, paces)",524,"Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of
money.  I won't get the insurance until
months after she's dead.  I don't imagine
you'll want to be stickin' around after
poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand;
that's more money than I could ever get my
hands on."
525,BOBBY,525,How much could you get?
526,JAKE,526,"Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a
maybe."
527,BOBBY,527,I need thirteen.
528,JAKE,528,That's a bit much.
529,BOBBY,529,"We're not talking about buying a car Jake.
We're talking about killing your wife. It's
thirteen, or it's nothing."
530,JAKE,530,"You drive a hard bargain, but I had a
feeling you were my boy when I met you."
531,BOBBY,531,"I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got
no choice but to do business with you.
Let's just call this a nasty little
marriage of convenience."
532,JAKE,532,"Don't say that.  I had a marriage of
convenience with Grace, and look where
that's lead...  Well, looks like we got
ourselves a contract."
533,BOBBY (sarcastic),533,Do we shake hands?
534,JAKE,534,"If you can't trust the man you've hired to
kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got
to look like an accident; that's the thing.
If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't
get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on
the chopping block while you're living it
up somewhere."
535,BOBBY,535,How do you want it?
536,JAKE,536,"How the hell should I know?  I've never had
a wife killed before. Jesus Christ!"
537,JAKE,537,"want this job, you don't know how to do
this? I guess I should have hired a
professional."
538,BOBBY,538,"You want to do this yourself?  I don't have
to do this, you know."
539,JAKE,539,"Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing.
I'm thinking. It can't be done at the
house. It should be..."
540,BOBBY,540,"Come to think of it, how 'bout some money
upfront?"
541,JAKE,541,"Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane
ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I"
542,JAKE,542,"This is what you do:  Go to the house to
see her."
543,BOBBY,543,And tell her what?
544,JAKE(V.O.),544,"...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see
her.  Tell her you don't care if she's
married or not, you had to be with her.
Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like
you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe
shift the conversation.  Get her thinking
about that jeep of hers.  She loves that
thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love.
She'll want to take you for a ride."
545,BOBBY,545,"I know you're not surprised I'm back here,
cause you can read my mind and all."
546,GRACE (seeing his new cut),546,"That's some cut. I told you to be more
careful."
547,BOBBY,547,"Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta
you say we get out of here, take a drive
somewhere, talk..."
548,GRACE,548,How do you know he's still not here?
549,BOBBY,549,Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
550,JAKE(V.O.),550,"She'll take you out somewhere in the
desert.  She loves it out there; ridin'
through the red rock and the mesas.  So do
I.  I guess we got that in common.  She'll
ride you out someplace quiet.  Someplace
deserted."
551,JAKE(V.O.),551,"There won't be anyone for miles around.
Just the two of you and some prairie dogs.
That's all.  You can sweet talk her a
little if you like.  Makes no difference to
me.  Just put her at ease, make her feel
relaxed --"
552,BOBBY,552,Are there snakes out here?
553,GRACE,553,"They hear you comin'.  They won't bother
you. Just don't sneak up on 'em."
554,BOBBY,554,Doesn't the isolation bother you?
555,GRACE,555,"Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a
reservation.  The sun, the desert; they
like a religion to us.  Jake's the same
way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're
alike that way.  That's about the only way."
556,BOBBY,556,You love him?
557,GRACE,557,No.
558,BOBBY,558,Did you ever?
559,GRACE,559,"Depends on what you call love. I grew up on
a reservation. A patch of desert in the
middle of nowhere. That's where they stick
Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us
to die. My brother killed himself when he
was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore.
There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket
out. Mom and me."
560,BOBBY,560,Is that why you're with him?
561,GRACE,561,"I let him think he was courtin' me, but I
reeled him in like a fish on a line. I
wanted him. I wanted what he could give me,
and I would've done anything to get him. Is
that love?"
562,BOBBY,562,I'm guessing no.
563,GRACE,563,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
564,BOBBY,564,"I take it things didn't much work out the
way you planned."
565,GRACE,565,"I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?"
566,GRACE(CONT),566,"All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake
like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind
being nothing but a big fish in a small
pond.  More like a little fish in a dried
up watering hole."
567,BOBBY,567,You could leave him.
568,GRACE,568,I don't know how.
569,BOBBY,569,Walk away.
570,GRACE,570,"It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take
chances; maybe you can wander around like
some stray wherever you please.  I can't.
I don't want to be alone.  I need to know
I'm going to be taken care of."
571,BOBBY,571,"You need a meal ticket is what you mean.
Some guy you can latch onto just long
enough for him to get you out of here."
572,GRACE,572,"Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't
try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.
I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I
guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I
tried to sucker you along like that.  Do
you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you
if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:
You just got to do whatever it takes to get
out."
573,BOBBY (soft echo),573,Whatever it takes.
574,GRACE,574,"I wish I was a bird.  I know it's stupid.
Every child says that.  When I was growing
up some of the old ones on the reservation
believed people could actually change into
animals.  I wish I could."
575,GRACE(CONT),575,"If I was a bird I would fly to Florida; to
Disney World.  I always wanted to go there.
I'd fly to New York.  Maybe.  I guess New
York isn't the best place to be a bird.
I'd fly to St. Louis, then New Orleans, all
over Texas.  Then I'd fly to California.  I
guess by then I'd have seen it all and I
could die."
576,GRACE(CONT),576,"They say you don't feel anything.  The
shock kills you before you hit the ground.
I don't know how they would know that.  But
I heard it's just like flying; straight
down into the ground.  I guess if it
doesn't hurt it's a beautiful thing."
577,GRACE,577,"Hate's a funny thing.  Right now I bet you
don't know if you want to kill me, or fuck
me."
578,GRACE,578,No...Stop!  I can't!
579,BOBBY,579,What's the matter?...Grace?
580,GRACE,580,Nothing.
581,BOBBY,581,Don't feel like nothing.
582,GRACE,582,"Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you
can."
583,BOBBY,583,"Grace, I've been fucked over too many
times, by too many women.  You're becoming
the queen of hot and cold."
584,GRACE,584,You'd never understand.
585,BOBBY,585,Try me.
586,GRACE,586,It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
587,BOBBY,587,Nothing I understand better than a mess.
588,GRACE (in great tension),588,"Jake was with my Mom after my real Dad
died."
589,BOBBY,589,You mean the Shaman?
590,GRACE,590,He
591,GRACE,591,"nothin' after he died. Jake took us in,
gave us a little money. He used to call me
his ""little halfbreed""... He kept Mom on
the side y'know, cause he was married
someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I
think, no one knew him around here...but
the thing was...you see..."
592,GRACE,592,"...he was raping me the whole time...for
years. He loved to do things to me. Believe
it or not, he used to say he was in love
with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a
woman's ass?"
593,BOBBY,593,Yeah.
594,GRACE,594,"You're sick too...he loved to do things to
me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up
cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She
become alcoholic...and the funny thing is--
I liked it. I liked being controlled by
Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as
he got, I wanted"
595,GRACE,595,"the way. Women say they don't want to be
taken like,"
596,GRACE,596,"-- they do. The first time he finished with
me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14.
Then he started crying like a baby...wanted
me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to
hate someone so much for so many years, but
still want to hold him, comfort him... They
found my Mom right down there (points) at
the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus
needles stuck all over her body and
Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk
and went insane. But I'll never believe she
ran off that cliff by accident. She was
born on this earth and she loved it. She
was like me. She just wanted to fly away."
597,GRACE,597,"After he got his divorce, he forced me to
marry him...but when I saw her body, I
swore to her on my soul that some day I'd
get Jake for what he did to her..."
598,BOBBY,598,I'm sorry...
599,GRACE,599,"Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?
(shrugs, stoic) Have you ever been to
California?"
600,BOBBY,600,Yeah.
601,GRACE (as if in a dream),601,Is it far from here?
602,BOBBY,602,"Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world."
603,GRACE,603,Is it pretty?
604,BOBBY,604,"Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches.
Blue water and clear skies as far as you
can see."
605,GRACE (like a little girl),605,Would you take me with you?
606,BOBBY (pause),606,I wish I could.
607,GRACE,607,"Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we
get there you can dump me. I don't care. I
just want to get out of here."
608,BOBBY,608,"Honey, baby, I"
609,BOBBY,609,of here
610,BOBBY,610,"lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car
back from that crazy mechanic..."
611,GRACE,611,Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
612,BOBBY,612,"You don't have any money put away, do you?"
613,GRACE,613,"Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at
a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't
want me goin' anywhere..."
614,BOBBY,614,"...you could get me money. I'll get you
out of here."
615,GRACE,615,There's money. A lot.
616,BOBBY,616,Where?
617,GRACE,617,"Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In
the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit
there and count it."
618,BOBBY,618,What do you mean?
619,GRACE,619,"At night. He just sits there and laughs and
talks to himself and counts it. I heard
him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert
thousand dollars down there. Maybe more."
620,BOBBY,620,In
621,GRACE,621,"Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He
don't trust banks. He keeps the money in
the floor right under the bed. He loves it
so much, he wouldn't think of spending any
of it on me. I never seen it but I know
he's got more than a hunnert thousand at
least..."
622,BOBBY,622,One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
623,GRACE (puzzled),623,What do you mean?
624,BOBBY (ignoring her),624,"If it's in a safe we'd have to get the
combination--"
625,GRACE,625,"It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all
the time.  I mean"
626,GRACE,626,scratches up against me when we do it.
627,BOBBY,627,"If the key's on him, how do we get the key?"
628,GRACE,628,Kill him.
629,BOBBY,629,"I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody."
630,GRACE,630,"It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's
had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he
wouldn't even have to"
631,GRACE,631,"(seductively) I mean, sometime in the
middle of the night, when it's quiet...when
he's asleep, you could just come up behind
him when he's pounding on me and..."
632,BOBBY,632,"Shit! Listen to you... Are you crazy,
Grace?"
633,BOBBY,633,"Jesus Christ! I think this place is making
me crazy. I was crazy to come back here and
see you. I'm crazy for listening to anyone
in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy
if I spent another minute with you."
634,GRACE,634,"But it's in you, Bobby. I see it. I see
Death. It's in your heart. Let it out for
me. Let it out..."
635,GRACE,635,"Do it for me, Bobby, you'll never regret
it. I promise you. I'll do anything for
you."
636,BOBBY,636,I...take me back to town...
637,GRACE,637,"You need the money, Bobby. It's a lot more
than $100,000. A lot more. How are you
going to get out of here? You need the
money. Whatever it takes, Bobby, remember?"
638,GRACE,638,"Where you going? I'll give you the
ride...Come back! Bobby? It's three miles."
639,GRACE (to herself),639,Bobby?...Whatever it takes.
640,JAKE (V.O.),640,"You've got the killing in you, boy."
641,JAKE (V.O.),641,Next time you'll do just fine.
642,BOBBY,642,No!
643,BLIND MAN,643,"It's the desert that makes you crazy. The
loneliness out here. Nobody to talk to.
People on the run. Trailer parks. White
trash. I seen some peculiar things on a hot
day.  I seen a scorpion sting itself to
death.  It just keeps driving its tail into
its body again and again.  A little killer
killing itself.  Seen a coyote kill itself
too.  Just kept on biting and tearing at
its own legs.  Near tore one clean off
before it bled to death.  And what a white
man'll do when it's freezing one moment,
hot as hell the next. A man could get
hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders
with another (smacking his lips) kiss kissy
kiss. Nice pussy y'see, see it coming. I
don't know what it is about the desert. I
figger it's sort of like putting a kettle
of water over a fire.  People is mostly
water.  We boil when it's hot.  'Cept when
we boil the water's got no place to go.  It
just churns inside of us until we can cool
off.  If it's not too late."
644,BOBBY,644,You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
645,BLIND MAN,645,"Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I
can't see."
646,BOBBY,646,That a fact?
647,BLIND MAN,647,"I can see just fine.  For example:  You're
a young man who thinks he's got someplace
to be."
648,BOBBY,648,Maybe I do.
649,BLIND MAN,649,"Or maybe you just think you do. Just
another small town. One guy chasing you.
You go big town. Just gonna have four guys
after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets
down to one thing -- are you a human being
or are you one of those hungry ghosts out
there never satisfied with nothing? Cause
you gotta remember you can run just as far
as you can, but wherever you go, that's
where you gonna be."
650,BOBBY,650,I think I've heard that before.
651,BLIND MAN,651,What do you want for free?
652,BOBBY,652,"You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man."
653,BLIND MAN,653,"Seems like I do but only cause end of the
day we're all eyes in the same head. And
everything is everything."
654,BOBBY,654,What?
655,BLIND MAN,655,...And everything is nothing too.
656,BOBBY (shakes his head),656,"Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner
and spout wise."
657,BLIND MAN,657,Think you'll live that long?
658,BLIND MAN,658,"Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you.
Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see
him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But
that ain't mean I don't know what's going
on around here. They're all cursed. Yes
sir."
659,BOBBY,659,Who's cursed?
660,BLIND MAN,660,"All them miners last century. Hungry
ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at
the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think
I'm fooling around here. White sky was on
fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a
flash, then darkness descended upon me.
They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I
cursed them. White people can't seem to
stay away from Indians (grabs his bandaged
hand, smelling the blood). You gotta watch
where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy
pussy, Indian pussy."
661,BLIND MAN (finishing),661,"...but they gotta know you don't fuck
around with Indians."
662,BOBBY,662,"I thought you said you lost your eyes in
the war?"
663,BLIND MAN,663,"So now you're going to tell me where I lost
my eyes. You don't think I know where I
lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them.
I lost them in the war. The war in the
joint. There's always wars in the joint.
Cause I was a code talker in the joint and
in the war too.(sniffs) Mmmm, nothing like
the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy."
664,BOBBY,664,"Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here
in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding."
665,BLIND MAN,665,"Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's
the curse. The mines done it. All that
uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium,
assononium, all that ""om""! Everybody's got
a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You
don't rip up the Earth and take everything
out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says,
""the more you eat, the more you
want....""..."
666,BOBBY,666,I got things to do.
667,BLIND MAN (offended),667,"Oh well, go do 'em. You don't see me
stopping you..."
668,BLIND MAN,668,"...But ain't you got a little something for
the infirm?"
669,BOBBY,669,"I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you
next time."
670,BLIND MAN,670,"Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well."
671,JENNY,671,"Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted
to thank you."
672,BOBBY,672,For what?
673,JENNY,673,For defending my honor this afternoon.
674,BOBBY,674,"I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I
wasn't defending you."
675,JENNY,675,But you was going to fight for me.
676,BOBBY,676,"I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was
just going to beat the shit out of your
boyfriend."
677,JENNY,677,"He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him
take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken
for.  Not yet that is."
678,BOBBY,678,"Get it through your head, little girl; I'm
not going for you.  If this Toby likes you,
then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're
not going to get much better in this town."
679,JENNY,679,"That's what I thought until you came riding
in.  I saw your car over at the gas
station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me
for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this
time of day."
680,BOBBY,680,How old are you?
681,JENNY,681,"Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in
two years, but that don't mean you can't
take me for a ride if you want."
682,BOBBY,682,"No, I don't want to take you for a ride.
What I want is for ... Hey, you don't
think you can get $150 from your parents,
could you?"
683,TOBY(O.C.),683,Mister!
684,BOBBY,684,"Oh, shit!"
685,TOBY,685,"That's right, Mister.  You better be
afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you
didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin'
around with my girl behind my back."
686,BOBBY,686,"I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.
Would you please tell him?"
687,JENNY,687,"You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get
in his fancy car and ride off and leave you
behind."
688,BOBBY,688,What the hell are you talking about?
689,JENNY,689,What's your name anyway?
690,TOBY,690,"Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust
you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a
million pieces and then ... and then bust
those pieces up, and then ... and then
spread them all around.  That's what I'm
gonna do.  You don't know what you're
dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm
psycho crazy."
691,BOBBY,691,"Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like
dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets
hurt. (at his wit's end) All right.  Let's
do this."
692,JENNY,692,"Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you
beat him all up and knock out all his teeth
and he's just drooling and bleeding all
over hisself, 'cause we love each other and
we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his
love child."
693,BOBBY,693,Will you shut up!
694,TOBY,694,"You gonna pay for that, Mister."
695,SHERIFF(O.C.),695,Toby!
696,TOBY,696,"Hey, Sheriff Potter."
697,SHERIFF (tough),697,"Toby, I just came from your mother's place.
She's worried sick about you.  She says she
ain't seen you since this morning."
698,TOBY,698,"That ain't true, Sheriff.  I was home for
lunch."
699,SHERIFF,699,"Boy, I'm not trying to hear nothing from
you except that you're heading home.  Now
run along."
700,TOBY,700,"Yes, sir.  Come on, Jenny."
701,JENNY,701,I want to stay.
702,TOBY,702,I said come on!
703,JENNY,703,"Bye, Mister.  Don't go nowhere without me.
I wanna have your love child."
704,TOBY,704,"Next time, Mister.  Next time."
705,SHERIFF,705,Where ya goin'?
706,BOBBY,706,Harlin's.
707,SHERIFF,707,Get in.
708,SHERIFF,708,"Seen you popping up a little bit of
everywhere today.  You're not planning on
staying are you?"
709,BOBBY,709,"No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if
that's what you're worried about."
710,SHERIFF,710,That's a nasty cut you got there.
711,BOBBY,711,"Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad
as it looks."
712,SHERIFF,712,"There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's
today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he
got whacked around good by one of the
robbers."
713,BOBBY,713,"Sounds like it. I wish I could help
Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and
get on up the road."
714,JAKE,714,"Everything all right, Virgil?"
715,SHERIFF (a little nervous),715,"Just fine, Jake. Where you going?"
716,JAKE,716,"I was just up at Darrell's. How's the wife?
That little eskimo baby walkin' yet?"
717,SHERIFF,717,Oh just fine.
718,JAKE,718,"You haven't seen Grace around, have you?
I'm looking for her."
719,SHERIFF,719,"No. But if I do, I'll tell her you're
looking for her, Jake."
720,JAKE (looking at Bobby),720,"Whatcha got there, some trash?"
721,SHERIFF,721,"Peculiar, how things happen. A man's car
breaks down. There's a hold up. People die
and all that money -- and now old Jake out
looking for his young wife. And then you
show up..."
722,SHERIFF,722,"Time's running out, son. I'll be seeing you
in the morning..."
723,DARRELL,723,"Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you
wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so
good."
724,BOBBY,724,"Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a
bit."
725,DARRELL,725,"One of those days you feel like you been
runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer
to where you tryin' to get than when you
started?"
726,BOBBY,726,You've been there?
727,DARRELL,727,"Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade
with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do
when you feel like that 'cept tough it out."
728,BOBBY,728,You believe that?
729,DARRELL,729,"You think bad, and bad is what you get."
730,BOBBY,730,"That's a good piece of advice, Darrell."
731,DARRELL,731,No charge.
732,BOBBY,732,"Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty
bucks for the car, as soon as I get where
I'm going I swear I'll--"
733,DARRELL,733,Two-hundred.
734,BOBBY,734,What?
735,DARRELL,735,It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
736,BOBBY,736,"You said this morning the hose was going to
run me one-fifty."
737,DARRELL,737,"Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone
I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run
you another fifty."
738,BOBBY,738,I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
739,DARRELL,739,"Yeah, but it was shot."
740,BOBBY,740,"I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to
do it!  You can't just do unauthorized
work."
741,DARRELL,741,"Well, now, you just know all there is about
bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you
read the sign."
742,BOBBY,742,What sign?
743,DARRELL,743,"The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do
unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to
do? Just let you ride out of here with a
bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident
and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna
blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there
goes my reputation."
744,BOBBY,744,"What reputation?  You're nothing but an
ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick."
745,DARRELL,745,Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
746,BOBBY,746,"Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car."
747,DARRELL,747,"Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe
me money, and this car ain't going nowheres
until I get it.  And if you take another
five hours I'll find another fifty dollars
worth of work to do on it. Is that clear?
Now get out of here 'fore I call the
Sheriff,"
748,DARRELL,748,"You want to play, Mister?  I'll play with
you.  You want to smash something?  So do
I."
749,BOBBY,749,No! Okay! Okay!
750,DARRELL,750,"What's the matter?  The fight gone out of
you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.
Maybe two."
751,"BOBBY (pleading, almost crying)",751,"Please, just leave the car alone!"
752,DARRELL,752,"Mister, you already pissed me off but good."
753,BOBBY (about to lose it),753,Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
754,DARRELL,754,"There you go, sweet talking me again."
755,BOBBY,755,"Look, Harlin."
756,DARRELL,756,Darrell.
757,BOBBY,757,"Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just
have to get something out of the trunk."
758,BOBBY,758,What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
759,DARRELL,759,"Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to
pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk
key."
760,BOBBY,760,"And you had to go into the trunk, didn't
you?"
761,DARRELL,761,"When I work on a car, I work on a car."
762,BOBBY (snaps),762,You motherfucker! (etc.)
763,DARRELL,763,"You can't help yourself, can you mister?
You're out of control."
764,BOBBY,764,I need a ticket.
765,CLERK,765,Where to?
766,BOBBY,766,Out of here.
767,CLERK,767,"But, in particular?"
768,BOBBY,768,"I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to
Mexico?  That's where I have to go."
769,CLERK,769,"Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico
would you like--"
770,BOBBY,770,"I don't care, just get me there."
771,CLERK,771,"How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a
local, arrives in two hours, and transfer
in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the
border."
772,BOBBY,772,How much?
773,CLERK,773,"One way, or round trip?"
774,BOBBY,774,One way.
775,CLERK,775,30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
776,BOBBY,776,"Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got."
777,CLERK,777,The ticket is 30.55.
778,BOBBY (rifling his pockets),778,"I bought a beer.  That was a dollar
something. Then I gave that girl 25 cents
for the juke box. And the blind man...the
soda...I..I'd have 30 if...if..."
779,CLERK,779,"I'm sorry, sir.  It's $30.55 for the
ticket."
780,BOBBY (to himself),780,"Yeah.  Just a little short.  Figures.  I
just wanted to get out, that's all."
781,BOBBY,781,"Please, ma'am, you don't understand! I"
782,BOBBY,782,"to get out of here.  They're going to come
looking for me."
783,BOBBY,783,"If I can't get this ticket then I'm going
to have to do things to get out of here."
784,BOBBY,784,"anybody, I just want to leave."
785,BOBBY,785,can't...I can't.
786,CLERK,786,"Okay, I'll give you the ticket, sir,
but...just...just, please calm down,
please!"
787,CLERK,787,"Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three.
Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight."
788,BOBBY,788,I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
789,BOBBY,789,Holy shit!
790,SERGEI,790,"Got you, shitface! Bobby Cooper. Bobby
Cooper..."
791,SHERIFF,791,"Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how
they work things in Nevada, but we got
speed limits in this state."
792,SERGEI,792,"Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am
looking town. I not even moving."
793,SHERIFF,793,"Whoa, what kind of accent you got there?
You one of them Russians?"
794,SERGEI,794,"I am Russian, da! I am also"
795,SERGEI,795,"da? Maybe we work something out, my friend
Sheriff?"
796,SHERIFF,796,"What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just
cause you Russians ain't commies anymore,
don't think money can buy everything..."
797,SHERIFF,797,"What's that? (He grabs the gun)
...""concealed"" is a definite no no in this
town, Ivan. You know anything about
Jamilla's grocery store?"
798,SERGEI,798,"What fuckin grocery store, you fucking
shithead idiot! You call yourself a
police..."
799,SHERIFF,799,"Get out of the car, spread them. You can
jawbone all you want or you have the right
to"
800,SHERIFF,800,"motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to
the can."
801,SERGEI,801,I want my lawyer!
802,BOBBY,802,Ow!
803,TOBY,803,"Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said
Toby Tucker beat the living shit out of
someone without giving them a fair chance."
804,BOBBY (gasping),804,"What the hell are you doing?  You fucking
psycho!"
805,TOBY,805,"I'm doing what any man would do if he'd
been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass."
806,BOBBY,806,"You idiot!  You don't even know what you're
fighting over!"
807,TOBY,807,"My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.
Now get up off the ground, or do I have to
whoop you where you lie?"
808,JENNY,808,"Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!"
809,TOBY,809,"You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him
up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to
see."
810,JENNY,810,"Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care
what he does to you, we can still be
together."
811,BOBBY,811,Get away from me!
812,TOBY,812,"Now, what's this?"
813,BOBBY,813,Give it to me!
814,TOBY,814,Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
815,BOBBY,815,"I'm leaving.  You never have to see me
again.  Just please, give me the ticket!"
816,TOBY,816,"This means something to you?  Jenny means
something to me."
817,BOBBY,817,Nooo!
818,TOBY (between bites),818,"I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be
eatin' nothing but soup the erst of your
days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than
you when I'm done.  I'm gonna mess you up
so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.
I'm gonna ..."
819,JENNY,819,Stop it!  You're killing him!
820,JENNY,820,You're killing him!  Toby!?  Toby!?
821,JENNY,821,You killed him! You killed him!
822,BOBBY,822,"Hello, Grace?  It's Bobby."
823,GRACE (coolly),823,"I thought you'd be on your way to Vegas by
now.  Is there something you wanted?"
824,BOBBY,824,I wanted to talk.
825,GRACE(V.O.),825,"I don't think we have anything to talk
about."
826,BOBBY,826,What about us?
827,GRACE,827,"There is no us, remember?"
828,BOBBY,828,"Except I can't get you out of my head,
Grace."
829,GRACE,829,Stop it.
830,BOBBY (V.O.),830,"Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the
truth scare you?"
831,GRACE,831,Because I know you're full of shit.
832,BOBBY,832,"I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here,
and I want to take you with me."
833,GRACE (V.O.),833,I thought you couldn't get your car.
834,BOBBY,834,I could if I had Jake's money.
835,GRACE (V.O.),835,Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
836,BOBBY,836,"I don't give a damn about the money.  I
want you, and I want to get us out of this
shithole.  There's only one way to do that."
837,GRACE,837,"Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?"
838,BOBBY,838,"I came back for you; this morning I came
back.  Before I even knew about the money.
You're what I want."
839,BOBBY,839,"The only reason I stormed off is because
you spooked me talking about Jake.  But
I've had nothing but time to think about
it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and
us getting the hell out of here.  But we've
got to get the money, baby.  We get the
money, I get the car, then we get the hell
out."
840,GRACE,840,You said you couldn't kill anybody.
841,BOBBY,841,"We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him
out and tie him up 'till we get away."
842,BOBBY,842,"It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this
for you.  I'm doing this so you can
fly...fly like a bird."
843,BOBBY (V.O.),843,Grace ... Grace?
844,GRACE,844,"After dark.  I'll leave the back door
unlocked."
845,JAKE,845,Who was that on the phone?
846,GRACE,846,Wrong number.
847,JAKE,847,"You spent a long time talking for a wrong
number.  But then you make friends so
easily.  Don't you, Grace?"
848,GRACE,848,"I put up new drapes, Jake."
849,JAKE,849,"I know.  I was here when your apprentice
was helping you.  Remember?"
850,GRACE,850,You never said anything.  About the drapes.
851,JAKE,851,They look nice.
852,GRACE,852,You haven't even looked at them once.
853,JAKE,853,They look nice.
854,GRACE,854,"I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought
you would like the colors."
855,"JAKE (softly, admiring)",855,"You look just like your mama when you move
like that against the light."
856,JAKE,856,"What the hell you looking at, girl?"
857,GRACE,857,"Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing."
858,BLIND MAN,858,"Well, that's it.  Sun's going down.  People
go home, trade stories over dinner.
They'll talk about the day, about the heat,
laugh about something crazy it made them
do.  They'll kiss, sleep a few hours, then
do it all over again."
859,BOBBY,859,"The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through
it all right."
860,BLIND MAN (giving back the change),860,Keep it.
861,BLIND MAN (OVER),861,"Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day;
separate, but equal.  Night is when you let
your guard down; when you see things in the
shadows and hear things in the dark."
862,BOBBY,862,"Difference between you and me, old man, is
I see the glass half full, you see it half
empty."
863,BLIND MAN,863,"Night is when you want to sleep, but the
dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.
It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high
in the sky so you could see what it is
you're afraid of."
864,BOBBY,864,You afraid of the dark?
865,BLIND MAN,865,"Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All
cause of a woman who made me this way.
People are afraid of what they can't see.
I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same
to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy
kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp,
slurp, the kiss of death (he makes a
strange sound). It's all the same to me."
866,BOBBY,866,"So, we're all just floating along like
twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is
that it?"
867,BLIND MAN,867,More or less.
868,BOBBY,868,"Not this twig, friend.  I got plans."
869,BLIND MAN,869,"Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder
than a man's plans. We all got plans. I
planned on seeing all my life. I know you
didn't plan on straying into town."
870,BOBBY,870,"No and I don't plan on sticking around
either."
871,BLIND MAN,871,"Well, don't say I didn't warn you when
things go your way."
872,BOBBY,872,"You got a lotta philosophy in you, old
timer but you don't fool me for one second
with all this blind man crap. One minute
you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's
the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to
you."
873,BLIND MAN,873,"Used to be a young smartass like you. Then
I got smart with the wrong man's daughter.
Got some acid poured on my peepers for my
trouble. You know human beings ain't always
just human -- they got animals living
inside 'em too...People give spare change
to war heroes not fools. All fools get is
pity. May not have eyes, but I see. And
you, boy?"
874,BLIND MAN,874,You got my pity.
875,BOBBY (doesn't believe him),875,Hope she was worth it.
876,BLIND MAN,876,"Oh, she was worth it.  She was worth every
black minute since."
877,BOBBY,877,Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
878,BLIND MAN,878,"Things ain't always the way they seem. You
got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day
comes Earthmaker is going to look in your
fucking heart! Then you better know what it
is you're doing."
879,BLIND MAN,879,"or just one of them hungry ghosts out there
floatin' around?"
880,BOBBY,880,You
881,BOBBY,881,man.
882,BLIND MAN,882,You know I won't be seeing you.
883,BLIND MAN,883,"Cheap bastard. Gives me back my own
money... Well, Jesse, time's up, let's go
for a walk."
884,JAKE(O.C.),884,"What the hell you doin', Grace?  Are you
coming to bed, or aren't you?"
885,JAKE,885,"Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You
like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta
go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but
you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't
you, cause you know Daddy's the best."
886,GRACE,886,"Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please."
887,JAKE,887,"You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my
heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You
betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't
no forgivin' ya, girl!"
888,GRACE,888,"Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!"
889,JAKE,889,"You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's
heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it
away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause
your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost
baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya
alone."
890,GRACE,890,No! No! Please!
891,JAKE,891,"Oh baby, I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry..."
892,JAKE,892,"I didn't mean to hurt you so bad. It
just...got away..."
893,JAKE,893,"Forgive me, baby, forgive me!"
894,GRACE,894,What's the matter?
895,JAKE,895,You didn't hear something?
896,GRACE,896,"Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my
ass."
897,JAKE,897,There's someone in the house.
898,GRACE (nervous),898,"Maybe...maybe the wind blew something over
(encouraging him to continue). Come on
baby, keep going."
899,GRACE (realizing),899,What's that? Jake -- where's you get that?
900,JAKE,900,Relax baby. Stay here.
901,GRACE,901,"Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff."
902,JAKE,902,"Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared
of things..."
903,JAKE,903,"Well, well.  As I live and breathe.  I
didn't expect to be seeing the like of you
again.  Thought you'd be long on your way
by now."
904,BOBBY,904,"That's my gun...(then) That fucking
Darrell!"
905,JAKE,905,"I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but
he's my half brother. We own Harlin's
together, yeah, that little redneck manages
to get paid no matter how things work out."
906,BOBBY (realizing),906,You been workin' me the whole time.
907,JAKE,907,"I guess this is what they call ""ironee""?
Hunh?"
908,BOBBY,908,"It's not what you think, Jake."
909,JAKE,909,"No, but it don't matter anyway when you're
lying there with your brains all over my
carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about
this drifter, didn't have enough money to
fix his car. And Darrell happened to find
his gun, and through maybe this drifter
heard old Jake got some money stashed away,
and figgered he might try to break in and
steal it!"
910,BOBBY,910,Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
911,JAKE,911,"...And he thought he'd clock old Jake
McKenna and turn his brains into wall
paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or
$20,000, or $200,000..."
912,BOBBY (very serious),912,"That's not the reason I'm here, Jake."
913,JAKE,913,There's another reason? It better be good.
914,BOBBY (V.O.),914,I came for Grace.
915,JAKE (V.O.),915,You came to take my wife from me?
916,BOBBY (sincere),916,No. I came to kill her.
917,JAKE (V.O.),917,Shhh! Liar.
918,BOBBY (V.O.),918,"It's the truth, Jake."
919,JAKE,919,"That's a thick change of heart from this
afternoon."
920,BOBBY,920,"Maybe I don't like being played, like she
played us today.  Maybe I don't like that
at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe
I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother."
921,JAKE,921,"You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of
talk."
922,BOBBY,922,"Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to
kill me, and if it comes down to me or
Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going
to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me
two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the
body where no one will ever find it. She
showed me the perfect place. There won't be
enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the
the money.  I've got to have the money."
923,JAKE,923,She's in the bedroom.
924,BOBBY,924,Wanna give me my gun?
925,JAKE,925,A strangling'll do just fine. Go to work.
926,BOBBY,926,How 'bout the pipe?
927,JAKE (sarcastic),927,She's got a slender neck.
928,JAKE,928,Hold on a second! Come here!
929,JAKE,929,"How the hell did you know where the
bedroom's at?"
930,BOBBY,930,What are you talking about!
931,JAKE (getting closer),931,"This morning when I came in on you and
Grace, you swore you hadn't been near the
bedroom. Now you make straight for it."
932,BOBBY (V.O.),932,"Come on, Jake --"
933,JAKE (V.O.),933,"Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You
probably didn't even make it out to the
desert this afternoon..."
934,JAKE,934,"...Or did you just ply the afternoon away
between my sheets putting your lips all
over her, you little horndog..."
935,BOBBY (changing tactics),935,"What difference does it make if I slept
with her? We're gonna kill her."
936,JAKE,936,"You're right! I don't give a damn about
her. But killing her's one thing. Fucking
her behind my back, that's another!"
937,BOBBY,937,O.K.! I admit it! I fucked her! But it's
938,BOBBY,938,wants you
939,BOBBY,939,and she wants your money.
940,JAKE (hesitates),940,What are you babbling about?
941,BOBBY (talking fast),941,"Think about it! How do you think I got in
here? Did you hear any glass break? Did you
hear a door splinter?"
942,BOBBY (V.O.),942,"How did the evening end?  After you went to
bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long
enough to leave the door unlocked?  Is that
what happened?"
943,JAKE,943,"You'd tell me anything to save your
pathetic life."
944,BOBBY,944,"You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake.
You know how badly she wants to get the
fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you,
Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me
kill her.  All I want is two-hundred
dollars to get out of here with."
945,JAKE,945,Two-hundred dollars?
946,BOBBY,946,"Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll
kill her!"
947,JAKE,947,"Sweet Christ, I'd be doing the world a
favor, ridding it of the likes of you. Get
your miserable ass off the floor. You're
positively pathetic... Go on, go kill
Grace."
948,JAKE,948,"I'm not letting you walk for nothing. Two
hundred dollars. Do it, boy."
949,GRACE,949,Jake!
950,JAKE,950,Grace!!
951,JAKE,951,"Well...looks like you got him, Grace.
That's good...that's real good.  He must of
slipped past me, but you got him.  Looks
like that drifter from this morning.  Got
to be careful who you make friends with,
sweetheart."
952,JAKE,952,"Why don't you put that down? It's all over
now.  Put it down."
953,JAKE,953,"Go on, girl.  Put it down."
954,JAKE,954,"Aww, that's my Grace:  Not about to let
someone get the best of her.  That's what I
love about you.  As dangerous as you are
unpredictable."
955,BOBBY,955,"Grace, goddamit, do something!"
956,JAKE,956,Grace...?
957,JAKE,957,"Help me, Grace, help..."
958,GRACE,958,"Like you helped her, Jake?"
959,BOBBY,959,What the hell'd you wait for?
960,GRACE,960,The money's right here! Get the key!
961,BOBBY,961,No! You get it!
962,GRACE,962,Didn't I tell you?
963,BOBBY (plunging into the cash),963,"There must be 150, 200 thousand here!
Goddamnit Grace, you were right!"
964,GRACE,964,"We done it, Bobby. Oh my God!"
965,GRACE,965,Fuck me baby!
966,BOBBY (looking at Jake),966,What about him?
967,GRACE,967,"Let him watch. I want him to know what he's
missing."
968,DARRELL (O.C.),968,What you want?
969,BOBBY,969,Open up!
970,DARRELL (O.C.),970,"We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes
up."
971,DARRELL,971,"What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've
figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming
over.  What do you want?"
972,BOBBY,972,I want my car.
973,DARRELL,973,You got the money?
974,DARRELL,974,"Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar
bills.  And this morning you was broke."
975,BOBBY,975,That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
976,DARRELL,976,"I don't want no dirty money.  I run an
honest business."
977,BOBBY,977,"Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?"
978,DARRELL (pause),978,"Well, there's a $50 overnight storage
charge we got to talk about."
979,BOBBY,979,"All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?"
980,DARRELL,980,No.
981,BOBBY,981,"Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how
much you make selling my gun? Deduct it."
982,DARRELL (going to get the keys),982,Don't know nothing about no gun.
983,BOBBY,983,"Course you don't. Tell me something
Darrell. Forty thousand people die every
day! How come none of them are you?"
984,DARRELL (throws him the keys),984,I think you know where to find her.
985,BOBBY,985,And the trunk key.
986,DARRELL (pulls out the trunk key),986,"Topped off the tank for you. No charge.
Just my way of doing business."
987,"BOBBY (jovial, confident now)",987,"Listen up good, Darrell. I'm getting outta
this shithole. You're staying! And one
little peep outta you -- remember that gun
makes you part of the food chain. Your
prints are all over it. I'd be awful
careful whose rectum I was pointing my
finger in, Darrell."
988,GRACE,988,"Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with
you?"
989,BOBBY,989,"I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on
a rock.  Hurt like hell."
990,GRACE,990,"I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep
and his caddy in the garage. People'll
think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us
some time...I know a back road we can take."
991,BOBBY,991,"Good thinking. (looking at her four bags)
What's all this?"
992,GRACE,992,I'm not coming back.
993,BOBBY (accepting),993,"Awright, let's go. I want to be fifty miles
from here before the sun comes up."
994,GRACE,994,"Funny thing; the jeep wouldn't start. I had
to push it."
995,BOBBY (dryly),995,Funny thing... I'll get the bags.
996,BOBBY,996,I can't see it.
997,GRACE,997,"It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ...
there!  There it is!"
998,GRACE,998,"Oh, God!  I can't believe it.  I'm out.
I'm finally out!"
999,BOBBY,999,Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
1000,GRACE,1000,"You don't know what it feels like to be
free of that place."
1001,BOBBY,1001,I don't know about that?
1002,GRACE,1002,"You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my
entire life there. I feel like someone just
took a million pounds off my shoulders."
1003,BOBBY,1003,We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
1004,GRACE,1004,Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
1005,BOBBY,1005,"I want a place where only the vultures will
find him...(then) It'll be over soon,
Grace."
1006,GRACE,1006,"Then will you take me on your friends' boat
with you?"
1007,BOBBY,1007,I'm not sailing his boat.
1008,GRACE,1008,But I thought --
1009,BOBBY,1009,"We're going to buy a boat of our own baby,
and sail it wherever we want to go."
1010,GRACE,1010,Anywhere?
1011,BOBBY,1011,What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
1012,GRACE,1012,"Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've
dreamed of going there and just lying on
the beach while the water licked up against
my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there."
1013,BOBBY,1013,You already have.
1014,BOBBY,1014,"You know I thought you'd left me back
there."
1015,GRACE,1015,What are you talking about?
1016,BOBBY (emotional),1016,"When I got back from the garage, and your
jeep wasn't there, I thought you'd gone and
left me and taken the money."
1017,BOBBY (emotional),1017,"...Cause I never had any luck with women,
Grace. You don't know what I been through.
The shit I've taken. I thought you were
like the rest of 'em... but when you came
out of the house... well you're here Grace
and we might be starting in the shit but
we're starting where I never been --
together with"
1018,BOBBY (emotional),1018,Grace.
1019,GRACE,1019,I love you Bobby.
1020,BOBBY,1020,"We're gonna pull this off, Grace."
1021,GRACE,1021,"Oh, my God!"
1022,GRACE,1022,Don't stop!
1023,BOBBY,1023,"He must've seen us swerving on the road,
that's all, just gonna give us a ticket for
swerving..."
1024,SHERIFF (into loudspeaker),1024,"Pull over, goddamnit, pull over!"
1025,GRACE,1025,Keep going!
1026,BOBBY,1026,"Fuck this!...Just shut up, Grace. We done
nothing! Be cool. Let me do the talking. He
doesn't know anything."
1027,BOBBY (starts),1027,"'Evening Sheriff, sorry bout that but this
jackrabbit..."
1028,SHERIFF,1028,You had to
1029,GRACE (nervous cool),1029,"I would never do that to you, baby... He
killed Jake -- said he'd kill me if I
didn't come with him. All he wants is the
money."
1030,BOBBY,1030,What!
1031,GRACE,1031,"OK...but he never made me cum! Really
Virgil, I was only doing what I had to do
so we could be free. Just like we talked
about. It meant"
1032,BOBBY,1032,"You fucking him too Grace? Is everybody
fucking everybody in this town?"
1033,SHERIFF,1033,"You fuck this guy -- get him to do your
dirty work and you think you can take the
money and dump me?"
1034,GRACE,1034,"No baby, you got it wrong."
1035,SHERIFF,1035,"This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where
were you going to meet me?"
1036,GRACE,1036,"It's not like that it... Look, Virgil, I
got the money here."
1037,SHERIFF (hurt),1037,"Oh Grace, you can say what you want...but,
I watched you fuck that pervert for years
while you're telling me you loved me? What
happened to going to Milwaukee together?
You and me -- gonna open up the finest
sporting goods store that city ever did
see? Get us a place on the north shore, by
the lake? Season Brewer tickets! Just you
and me, Grace. What happened?"
1038,GRACE,1038,"All talk, that's all you did was talk, and
all I did was sit around getting older
waiting for you to free me! You never did
nothin' Virgil, you're weak! (pointing to
Bobby)"
1039,SHERIFF,1039,"This is some girl you and me got here
Bobby, yessir, an excellent cocksuck too,
wouldn't you say? (back at Grace)... Course
you had a lotta practice haven't you
darling, going way back to your crazy mama!"
1040,GRACE (deadly),1040,"Shut up, Virgil! Take your share of the
money. It's not so bad."
1041,SHERIFF,1041,"I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not
gonna give up everything I got for a lousy
50,000 dollars. It's"
1042,SHERIFF,1042,"nothing. The whole thing... I want you to
be my wife...(hopeful). What do you way
Grace?"
1043,GRACE,1043,"You sound just like Jake... I did see into
the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it.
Go back to your family. They love you."
1044,BOBBY (misunderstanding),1044,"Look, we got more. We got $200,000 at
least. Split it three ways, we all walk
away..."
1045,SHERIFF,1045,"Shut up, boy! You don't know shit round
here! (to Grace) Get back. Did she tell you
that story about the bird flying away?"
1046,BOBBY (rolling on the ground),1046,"Ow! Look, I ... ow!"
1047,GRACE,1047,Stop! Stop it!
1048,SHERIFF (kicking again and again),1048,"Were you going to help her fly away,
asshole? What'd you think, you were the
first boy to drift through this town she
came on to? She tell you the story about
old Jake forcing her to marry him? That's a
good story... How he killed her crazy Mama?"
1049,GRACE,1049,"Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!"
1050,SHERIFF,1050,...But I bet the story she
1051,SHERIFF,1051,"was the best story of all. How old crazy
Jake"
1052,SHERIFF,1052,"fucking Papa! And now she's killed the
sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill
you!"
1053,GRACE,1053,No...you! You!
1054,BOBBY,1054,Grace. No!
1055,GRACE,1055,"Help me get him off the road. Into the car!
We'll ditch his car... Get the fuck up!"
1056,BOBBY (finally),1056,"Jesus, did you have to kill him?"
1057,GRACE,1057,Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you
1058,GRACE,1058,me.
1059,BOBBY,1059,"He was in love with you Grace. He would've
done what you wanted, you could've made a
deal and ..."
1060,GRACE,1060,"The only deal he had in mind was killing
you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me
into sucking his dick for the rest of my
life... no thanks."
1061,BOBBY,1061,He was a
1062,BOBBY,1062,looking for you when you kill a cop...
1063,GRACE,1063,He was a scumbag!... He wanted
1064,GRACE,1064,These guys don't let go! Even when they're
1065,GRACE,1065,"like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same."
1066,GRACE,1066,"So, aren't you going to ask me?"
1067,BOBBY,1067,"Ask you what? You mean what kind of
horrifying sick shit is coming next?"
1068,GRACE,1068,"Don't you want to know...? I bet it's
burning a hole in your brain just now?"
1069,BOBBY,1069,"Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a
past..."
1070,GRACE,1070,"Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my
Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't
you want to know that?"
1071,BOBBY (shouting),1071,What do you want me to say!
1072,GRACE,1072,"Yes! I was! I was fucking Daddy! And I
married him!... I married him...okay?"
1073,BOBBY,1073,Why?
1074,GRACE,1074,"All I wanted was to be a kid... He took
that from me... They all did... (very
quietly, dangerously) They treated me like
meat. A piece of meat."
1075,GRACE,1075,"Fuck them! Fuck the whole town! They
deserved to die!"
1076,BOBBY,1076,And us Grace? What do we deserve?
1077,GRACE (crying quietly to herself),1077,"""Nin chonk, nin chonk,"" my Mama used to say
in Apache. ""Your worst is doing this to
you,"" she said, ""your worst has killed
you."" And ""Be go tsee"" -- ""you will find
out the result of what you have done...""
Just when you think it's over, when you've
gotten away, it begins. Cause you never get
away."
1078,GRACE,1078,"It's easy to judge someone else when you
don't know nothing about it... I'm Apache,
Bobby. You don't eat what I eat. You don't
see what I see. Don't judge me."
1079,BOBBY,1079,I don't want to think anymore.
1080,GRACE (quietly),1080,Then drive...
1081,D.J. (V.O.),1081,"...Nobody's sure where it was heading so
fast but the way it hit the semi, it won't
be getting home now! Hey area weather is
gonna be hot! Hot! Hot! Then cold! Cold!
Cold! Just like yesterday. Just like every
day. Some surprise, huh? So if you're
planning on anything,"
1082,D.J. (V.O.),1082,"the weather, just wait one minute. Got any
brains, get up to Alaska and get yourself
some trailer park where you don't see no
desert for miles and miles..."
1083,BOBBY (over),1083,Right there... Drop it there. I got it.
1084,GRACE,1084,"See ya, Virgil. God bless."
1085,GRACE (indicates the gun),1085,Is this what's bothering you Bobby?
1086,BOBBY,1086,"No Grace, my hand's bothering me."
1087,GRACE,1087,"You think now that Jake's dead, there's all
that money there and I don't need you
anymore, and I might just sneak up behind
you sometime and...pop!"
1088,GRACE,1088,"Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted
to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?"
1089,BOBBY,1089,You could give me my gun back.
1090,GRACE,1090,Why don't we just finish what we started.
1091,GRACE (after a moment with Jake),1091,"What do you think happens to someone's
spirit when they die?"
1092,BOBBY,1092,"I think nothing happens. You're dead meat.
That's it."
1093,GRACE,1093,"You don't believe in anything do you,
Bobby?"
1094,BOBBY,1094,"I believe in this moment, that's all. There
is nothing else."
1095,BOBBY,1095,Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
1096,GRACE,1096,"You hit me, Bobby? You hit a woman, you
motherfucker! Didn't your Momma ever teach
you anything...?"
1097,GRACE,1097,Well?
1098,BOBBY,1098,"Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the
money, then you're on your own."
1099,GRACE,1099,"Don't leave me. I want to say with you,
Bobby."
1100,BOBBY,1100,"Why? So when the cops catch up with us you
can sell me out again?"
1101,GRACE,1101,"I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to
tell him that to get his guard down. Just
like you told Jake you was going to kill
me!"
1102,BOBBY,1102,"You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies.
Your mother, your father, what story are
you on now?  How come the town didn't know
you was his daughter?"
1103,GRACE (in pain),1103,"Cause my Mom slept around. A lotta men!
Anybody could've been my father. But"
1104,BOBBY (not listening),1104,"Well you got what you wanted all along by
fucking me.  I wish you had told me the
goddamn truth in the first place!"
1105,GRACE (screws out),1105,I didn't
1106,GRACE (screws out),1106,unnerstand?
1107,BOBBY,1107,"When you're finished with me, I'm next! I
been there, baby. I been there with other
cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you
as far as California. If we can make that.
After that you're on your own. Try Mexico.
With all this bread, you can live like a
queen."
1108,GRACE,1108,"I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby!
Please, I really want to be with you. Don't
blow this. Don't you think I care about
you?"
1109,BOBBY,1109,"I think you're a lying, back-stabbing
psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me.
But it's nice to know you cared..."
1110,GRACE,1110,"You don't know your own mind. It blocks
your heart."
1111,BOBBY,1111,Give me a hand.
1112,BOBBY,1112,"Poor old Jake, a few drinks, a fight with
the sheriff over his wife. And both of 'em
ended up dead."
1113,BOBBY,1113,"Time to go for a walk, Jake."
1114,GRACE,1114,My mother died in this canyon.
1115,BOBBY,1115,"Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It
doesn't work with me. One, two, three..."
1116,BOBBY,1116,"Look, it's not so bad we split up. It might
be months before they find these guys. If
at all. I mean with the mountain lions
around here. Remember, if they can't find
no bodies, there's no crime... (She doesn't
respond.) We'll be in Phoenix by noon. Lose
this car, get another one. Texas, Mexico
are big countries, all that money Grace,
you'll meet someone else, you know, there's
a lot of hope with a $100,000..."
1117,GRACE,1117,Hope is a four-letter word.
1118,BOBBY,1118,But we all need that too. Hold him.
1119,BOBBY,1119,You make a pretty couple.
1120,BOBBY,1120,"Won this in a poker game in Reno. God knows
who it's registered to.  You shoulda been
more careful, Jake. See you later."
1121,BOBBY,1121,Now all we got to do is try
1122,GRACE,1122,Shit!
1123,BOBBY,1123,"Grace! Help me, Grace...! We been through
too much together.  We've only had one day,
but you and me have been through more than
most people ever will. I know you were
angry at me, and, you know, you were right!
I'm sorry I hit you. I was wrong about
leaving you. You don't belong in Mexico."
1124,BOBBY,1124,"Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you
wouldn't leave me, Grace."
1125,GRACE,1125,Bobby? Are you all right?
1126,BOBBY,1126,I busted my leg!
1127,GRACE,1127,Can you make it back up?
1128,BOBBY,1128,"Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow
rope. It should reach down here. Go get it,
throw it down."
1129,GRACE,1129,"Bobby, the trunk...it's locked. Throw the
keys up to me. I'll get the rope."
1130,BOBBY,1130,"I can't throw that far. You got to climb
down here and get the keys. You can make
it. It's the only way Grace."
1131,BOBBY,1131,"Grace!...Please, Grace!  You have to help
me."
1132,GRACE,1132,Okay. I'm coming. Calm down!
1133,BOBBY (off),1133,"I knew you'd help me. I knew you wouldn't
leave me baby, cause we're tied together
too close. We belong together always."
1134,"GRACE (yelling back, echoing)",1134,"Bobby! Don't flip out on me. I can't do
this alone. I know you don't trust me, but
you gotta pull yourself together, I'm not
gonna leave you...I never wanted it to go
down like this. It was different with you
Bobby. You had dreams like me. You
listened... I would've gone anywhere with
you, Bobby. We can make this work. I'm
sorry...I really am. I didn't wanna hurt
you."
1135,BOBBY (as he crawls),1135,"They're right here, Grace.  The keys.  Come
get me out of here... Know why else I could
never leave you?"
1136,GRACE,1136,Why's that?
1137,BOBBY,1137,'Cause I love you.
1138,GRACE,1138,And I love you too.
1139,BOBBY,1139,"And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I
don't know if I want to love you..."
1140,BOBBY,1140,"I love you Grace, but"
1141,BOBBY,1141,He
1142,BOBBY,1142,You're still lucky.
1143,BOBBY (waves back),1143,Adios --
1144,BOBBY (sighs),1144,Oh shit!...(then) Arizona.
