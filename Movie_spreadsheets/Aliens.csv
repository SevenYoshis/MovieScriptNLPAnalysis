nominal hull integrity.  Hypersleep
capsules, style circa late twenties..."
1,LEADER,1,"Lights are green.  She's alive.
Well, there goes out salvage, guys."
2,MED-TECH,2,"Why don't I open the viewport?
Watch your eyes."
3,MED-TECH,3,And how are we today?
4,RIPLEY,4,Terrible.
5,MED-TECH,5,"Just terrible?  That's better
than yesterday at least."
6,RIPLEY,6,"How long have I been on
Gateway station?"
7,MED-TECH,7,"Just a couple of days.  Do you
feel up to a visitor?"
8,RIPLEY,8,Jones!
9,RIPLEY,9,"Come here Jonesy you ugly old
moose...you ugly thing."
10,MAN,10,"Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke.
I work for the company, but other
than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to
see you're feeling better.  I'm told
the weakness and disorientation
should pass soon.  Side effects of
the unusually long hypersleep, or
something like that."
11,RIPLEY,11,"How long was I out there?  They
won't tell me anything."
12,BURKE,12,"Well, maybe you shouldn't worry
about that just yet."
13,RIPLEY,13,How long?
14,BURKE,14,"All right.  My instinct says
you're strong enough to handle
this...Fifty-seven years."
15,RIPLEY,15,"Fifty-seven...oh, Christ..."
16,BURKE,16,"You'd drifted right through the
core systems.  It's blind luck that
deep-salvage team caught you when
they...are you all right?"
17,MED-TECH,17,"Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue!
4-1-5!"
18,RIPLEY,18,No...noooo!
19,DOCTOR,19,"Hold her...Get me an airway, stat!
And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!"
20,MED-TECH,20,"Bad dreams again?  Do you want
something to help you sleep?"
21,RIPLEY,21,No.. I've slept enough.
22,RIPLEY,22,"We made it, Jones.  We made it."
23,RIPLEY,23,Dumbshit.
24,BURKE,24,"Sorry...I've been running behind
all morning."
25,RIPLEY,25,"Have they located my daughter
yet?"
26,BURKE,26,"Well, I was going to wait
until after the inquest..."
27,RIPLEY,27,Is she...?
28,BURKE,28,"Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married
name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six
...at time of death.  Two years
ago."
29,BURKE,29,I'm sorry.
30,RIPLEY,30,Amy.
31,BURKE,31,"Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't
licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred
Parkside Repository, Little Chute,
Wisconsin.  No children."
32,RIPLEY,32,"I promised her I'd be home for
her birthday.  Her eleventh
birthday.  I sure missed that
one."
33,RIPLEY,33,"Well...she has already learned
to take my promises with a grain
of salt.  When it came to flight
schedules, anyway."
34,RIPLEY,34,"You always think you can make it
up to somebody...later, you know.
But now I never can.  I never
can."
35,BURKE,35,"The hearing convenes at 0930.  You
don't want to be late."
36,RIPLEY,36,"You read my deposition...it's
complete and accurate."
37,BURKE,37,"Look, I believe you, but there are
going to be some heavyweights in
there.  You got Feds, you got
interstellar commerce commission,
you got colonial administration,
insurance company guys..."
38,RIPLEY,38,I get the picture.
39,BURKE,39,"Just tell them what happened.  The
important thing is to stay cool
and unemotional."
40,RIPLEY,40,"Do you people have earwax, of
what?  We have been here three
hours.  How many different ways
do you want me to tell the same
story?"
41,VAN LEUWEN,41,"Look at it from our perspective.
You freely admit to detonating the
engines of, and thereby destroying,
an M-Class star-freighter.  A
rather expensive piece of hardware..."
42,INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR,42,"Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
That's minus payload, of course."
43,VAN LEUWEN,43,"The shuttle's flight recorder
corroborates some elements of
your account.  That the Nostromo
set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed
planet, at that time.  That
repairs were made.  That it resumed
its course and was subsequently set
for self-destruct.  By you.  For
reasons unknown."
44,RIPLEY,44,"Look, I told you..."
45,VAN LEUWEN,45,"It did not, however, contain any
entries concerning the hostile
life form you allegedly picked up."
46,RIPLEY,46,"Then somebody's gotten to it...
doctored the recorder.  Who had
access to it?"
47,ECA REP,47,"Would you just listen to yourself
for one minute."
48,VAN LEUWEN,48,"The analysis team which went over
your shuttle centimeter by
centimeter found no physical
evidence of the creature you
describe..."
49,RIPLEY,49,"That's because I blew it out the
Goddamn airlock!"
50,RIPLEY,50,Like I said.
51,INSURANCE MAN,51,"Are there any species like this
'hostile organism' on LV-426?"
52,ECA REP,52,"No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous
life larger than a simple virus."
53,RIPLEY,53,"I told you, it wasn't indigenous.
There was an alien spacecraft there.
A derelict ship.  We homed on its
beacon..."
54,ECA REP,54,"To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed
over three hundred worlds and no one's
ever reported a creature which, using
your words..."
55,ECA REP,55,"...'gestates in a living human host'
and has 'concentrated molecular acid
for blood.'"
56,RIPLEY,56,"Look, I can see where this is
going.  But I'm telling you those
things exist.  Back on that planetoid
is an alien ship and on that ship
are thousands of eggs.  Thousands.
Do you understand?  I suggest you
find it, using the flight recorder's
data.  Find it and deal with it --
before one of your survey teams
comes back with a little surprise..."
57,VAN LEUWEN,57,"Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That
will be..."
58,RIPLEY,58,"...because just one of those
things managed to kill my entire
crew, within twelve hours of
hatching..."
59,VAN LEUWEN,59,"Thank you, that will be all."
60,RIPLEY,60,"That's not all, Goddamnit!  If
those things get back here, that
will be all.  Then you can just
kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss
it goodbye."
61,BURKE,61,"You had them eating out of your
hand, kiddo."
62,RIPLEY,62,"They had their minds made up
before I even went in there.
They think I'm a head case."
63,BURKE,63,You are a head case.  Have a donut.
64,VAN LEUWEN,64,"It is the finding of this board of
inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley,
NOC-14672. has acted with questionable
judgment and is unfit to hold an
ICC license as a commercial flight
officer."
65,VAN LEUWEN,65,"Said license is hereby suspended
indefinitely.  No criminal charges
will be filed at this time and you
are released on own recognizance
for a six month period of
psychometric probation, to include
monthly review by an ICC psychiatric
tech..."
66,RIPLEY,66,Why won't you check out LV-426?
67,VAN LEUWEN,67,"Because I don't have to.  The
people who live there checked it
out years ago and they never
reported and 'hostile organism'
or alien ship.  And by the way,
they call it Acheron now."
68,RIPLEY,68,"What are you talking about.
What people?"
69,VAN LEUWEN,69,"Terraformers...planet engineers.
It's what we call a shake 'n' bake
colony.  They set up atmosphere
processors to make the air
breathable...big job.  Takes
decades.  They've already been
there over twenty years.  Peacefully."
70,RIPLEY,70,How many colonists?
71,VAN LEUWEN,71,"Sixty, maybe seventy families."
72,RIPLEY,72,Sweet Jesus.
73,ELEVATOR PASSENGER,73,Do you mind?
74,LYDECKER,74,"You remember you sent some
wildcatters out to that
plateau, out past the Ilium
range, a couple days ago?"
75,SIMPSON,75,Yeah.  What?
76,LYDECKER,76,"There's a guy on the horn,
mom-and-pop survey team.  Says
he's homing on something and
wants to know if his claim will
be honored."
77,SIMPSON,77,"Christ.  Some honch in a cushy
office on Earth says go look at
a grid reference in the middle
of nowhere, we look.  They don't
say why, and I don't ask.  I
don't ask because it takes two
weeks to get an answer out here
and the answer's always 'don't
ask.'"
78,LYDECKER,78,So what do I tell this guy?
79,SIMPSON,79,"Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
he finds something it's his."
80,JORDEN,80,"Look at this fat, juicy magnetic
profile.  And it's mine, mine,
mine."
81,ANNE,81,"Half mine, dear."
82,NEWT,82,And half mine!
83,JORDEN,83,I got too many partners.
84,NEWT,84,"Daddy, when are we going back
to town?"
85,JORDEN,85,"When we get rich, Newt."
86,NEWT,86,"You always say that.  I wanna go
back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.'"
87,TIM,87,You cheat too much.
88,NEWT,88,Do not.  I'm just the best.
89,TIM,89,"Do too!  You go in places we
can't fit."
90,NEWT,90,So!  That's why I'm the best.
91,ANNE,91,"Knock it off!  I catch either of
you playing in the air ducts again
I'll tan your hides."
92,NEWT,92,Mom.  All the kids play it...
93,JORDEN,93,Holy shiiit!
94,JORDEN,94,"Folks, we have scored big this
time."
95,ANNE,95,"You kids stay inside.  I mean
it!  We'll be right back."
96,ANNE,96,Shouldn't we call in?
97,JORDEN,97,"Let's wait till we know what to
call it in as."
98,ANNE,98,How about 'big weird thing'?
99,TIM,99,Cheater!
100,NEWT,100,"Timmy...they've been gone a
long time."
101,TIM,101,"It'll be okay, Newt.  Dad knows
what he's doing."
102,ANNE,102,"Mayday!  Mayday!  This is
Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner
calling Hadley Control.
Repeat.  This is..."
103,VOICE FROM VIDEO,103,"Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the
family are heading off for the
colonies!"
104,BON,104,"Best decision I ever made, Bill.
We'll be starting a new life
from scratch, in a clean world.
No crime.  No unemployment..."
105,BURKE,105,"Hi, Ripley.  This is
Lieutenant Gorman of the..."
106,BURKE,106,Ripley we have to talk.
107,BURKE,107,"They've lost contact with the
colony on Acheron."
108,RIPLEY,108,No.  There's no way!
109,BURKE,109,Hear me out...
110,RIPLEY,110,"I was reamed, steamed and
dry-cleaned by you guys...and
now you want me to go back out
there?  Forget it."
111,BURKE,111,"Look, we don't know what's going
on out there.  It may just be a
down transmitter.  But if it's
not, I want you there...as an
advisor.  That's all."
112,GORMAN,112,"You wouldn't be going in with the
troops.  I can guarantee your
safety."
113,BURKE,113,"These Colonial Marines are
some tough hombres, and they're
packing state-of-the-art firepower.
Nothing they can't handle...right,
Lieutenant?"
114,GORMAN,114,"We're trained to deal with these
kinds of situations."
115,RIPLEY,115,"What about you?  What's your
interest in this?"
116,BURKE,116,"Well, the corporation co-financed
that colony with the Colonial
Administration, against mineral
rights.  We're getting into a lot
of terraforming...'Building Better
Worlds.'"
117,RIPLEY,117,"Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial."
118,BURKE,118,"I heard you were working in the
cargo docks."
119,RIPLEY,119,That's right.
120,BURKE,120,"Running loaders, forklifts, that
sort of thing?"
121,RIPLEY,121,"It's all I could get.  Anyway,
it keeps my mind off of...
everything.  Days off are worse."
122,BURKE,122,"What if I said I could get you
reinstated as a flight officer?
And that the company has agreed
to pick up your contract?"
123,RIPLEY,123,If I go.
124,BURKE,124,If you go.
125,BURKE,125,"It's a second chance, kiddo.  And
it'll be the best thing in the
world for you to face this fear
and beat it.  You gotta get back
on the horse..."
126,RIPLEY,126,"Spare me, Burke.  I've had my
psych evaluation this month."
127,BURKE,127,"Yes, and I've read it.  You
wake up every night, sheets
soaking, the same nightmare
over and over..."
128,RIPLEY,128,"No!  The answer is no.  Now
please go.  I'm sorry.  Just
go, would you."
129,BURKE,129,Think about it.
130,BURKE,130,"Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi..."
131,RIPLEY,131,"Burke, just tell me one thing.
That you're going out there to
kill them.  Not study.  Not bring
back.  Just burn them out...clean
...forever."
132,BURKE,132,That's the plan.  My word on it.
133,RIPLEY,133,All right.  I'm in.
134,RIPLEY,134,"And you my dear, are staying
right here."
135,SPUNKMEYER,135,"Arrgh.  I'm getting too old for
this shit."
136,DRAKE,136,"They ain't payin' us enough
for this."
137,DIETRICH,137,"Not enough to have to wake up
to your face, Drake."
138,DRAKE,138,"Suck air.  Hey, Hicks...you look
like I feel."
139,HUDSON,139,This floor's freezing.
140,APONE,140,"Christ.  I never saw such a
buncha old women.  You want me
to fetch your slippers, Hudson?"
141,HUDSON,141,"Would you, Sir?"
142,HUDSON,142,"Hey, Vasquez...you ever been
mistaken for a man?"
143,VASQUEZ,143,No.  Have you?
144,FROST,144,"Hey, hand job, you take my
towel?"
145,SPUNKMEYER,145,"I need some slack, man.  How
come they send us straight back
out like this?  We got some slack
comin', man."
146,HICKS,146,You just got three weeks.
147,SPUNKMEYER,147,"I mean breathing, not this frozen
shit."
148,DIETRICH,148,"Yeah, 'Top'...what about it?"
149,APONE,149,You know it ain't up to me.
150,APONE,150,"Awright!  Let's knock off the
grabass.  First assembly's in
fifteen...let's shag it."
151,VASQUEZ,151,Who's the fresh meat again?
152,FERRO,152,"She's supposed to be some kinda
consultant...
(exaggerated)
...She was an alien once."
153,HUDSON,153,Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
154,APONE,154,Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
155,HUDSON,155,"Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?"
156,APONE,156,"Rescue mission.  There's some
juicy colonists' daughters we
gotta rescue from virginity."
157,SPUNKMEYER,157,"Shee-it.  Dumbass colonists.
What's this crap supposed to be?"
158,WIERZBOWSKI,158,"Cornbread, I think.  Hey, I wouldn't
mind getting me some more a
that Arcturan poontang.  Remember
that time?"
159,HICKS,159,"Looks like that new Lieutenant's
too good to eat with us grunts."
160,WIERZBOWSKI,160,"Yeah.  Got a corn cob up his ass,
definitely."
161,BISHOP,161,"I'm sorry you feel that way
about Synthetics, Ripley."
162,RIPLEY,162,"You never said anything about an
android being here!  Why not?"
163,BURKE,163,"Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's
been policy for years to have a
synthetic on board."
164,BISHOP,164,"I prefer the term 'artificial person'
myself.  Is there a problem?"
165,BURKE,165,"A synthetic malfunctioned on her
last trip out.  Some deaths were
involved."
166,BISHOP,166,I'm shocked.  Was it an older model?
167,BURKE,167,Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.
168,BISHOP,168,"Well, that explains it.  The
A/2's were always a bit twitchy.
That could never happen now with
out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible
for me to harm or, by omission of
action, allow to be harmed a
human being."
169,BISHOP,169,More cornbread?
170,RIPLEY,170,"Just stay away from me, Bishop!
You got that straight?"
171,WIERZBOWSKI,171,"She don't like the cornbread
either."
172,APONE,172,Tench-hut!
173,GORMAN,173,"At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't
have time to brief before we
left Gateway but..."
174,HUDSON,174,Sir?
175,GORMAN,175,"Yes, Hicks?"
176,HUDSON,176,"Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks."
177,GORMAN,177,What's the question?
178,HUDSON,178,"Is this going to be a stand-up
fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?"
179,GORMAN,179,"All we know is that there's
still no contact with the colony
and that a xenomorph may be
involved."
180,WIERZBOWSKI,180,A what?
181,HICKS,181,It's a bug-hunt.
182,HICKS,182,So what are these things?
183,RIPLEY,183,"I've dictated what I know on
these."
184,APONE,184,Tease us a bit.
185,SPUNKMEYER,185,Yeah...previews.
186,RIPLEY,186,"Okay.  It's important to understand
this organism's life cycle.  It's
actually two creatures.  The first
form hatches from a spore...a sort
of large egg, and attaches itself
to its victim.  Then it injects
an embryo, detaches and dies.
It's essentially a walking sex organ.
The --"
187,HUDSON,187,"Sounds like you, Hicks."
188,RIPLEY,188,"The embryo, the second form, hosts
in the victim's body for several
hours.  Gestating.  Then it..."
189,RIPLEY,189,"...then it...emerges.  Moults.
Grows rapidly --"
190,VASQUEZ,190,I only need to know one thing.
191,RIPLEY,191,Yes?
192,VASQUEZ,192,Where they are.
193,DRAKE,193,Yo!  Vasquez.  Kick ass!
194,VASQUEZ,194,Anytime.  Anywhere.
195,HUDSON,195,"Somebody said alien...she
thought they said illegal alien
and signed up."
196,VASQUEZ,196,Fuck you.
197,HUDSON,197,Anytime.  Anywhere.
198,RIPLEY,198,"Am I disturbing you conversation
Mr. Hudson?"
199,RIPLEY,199,"I hope you're right.  I really
do."
200,BURKE,200,"I suggest you study the disks
Ripley has been kind enough to
prepare for you."
201,GORMAN,201,Are there any questions?  Hudson?
202,HUDSON,202,"How do I get out of this
chicken-shit outfit?"
203,GORMAN,203,"All right.  I want this to go
smooth and by the numbers.  I
want DCS and tactical database
assimilation by 0830."
204,GORMAN,204,"Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
drop-ship prep details will have
seven hours..."
205,BISHOP,205,"Attention.  This concluded final
maneuvering operations.  Thank
you for your cooperation.  You
may resume work."
206,BURKE,206,Still nothing from the colony?
207,GORMAN,207,Dead on all channels.
208,FROST,208,"Clear, please."
209,HUDSON,209,Excuse me.
210,RIPLEY,210,"I feel like a fifth wheel
here.  Is there anything I can
do?"
211,APONE,211,"I don't know.  Is there anything
you can do?"
212,RIPLEY,212,"I can drive that loader.  I've
got a Class Two rating.  My
latest career move."
213,RIPLEY,213,Where you want it?
214,APONE,214,"Let's move it, girls!  On
the ready line.  Let's go,
let's go."
215,HUDSON,215,"I am ready, man.  Ready to get
it on.  Check-it-out.  I am the
ultimate badass...state of the
badass art.  You do not want to
fuck with me.  Hey, Ripley, don't
worry.  Me and my squad of
ultimate badasses will protect you.
Check-it-out..."
216,HUDSON,216,"Independently targetting
particle-beam phalanx.  VWAP!
Fry half a city with this puppy.
We got tactical smart-missles,
phased-plasma pulse-rifles,
RPG's.  We got sonic eeelectronic
ballbreakers, we got nukes, we
got knives...sharp sticks --"
217,HICKS,217,Save it.
218,HUDSON,218,"Sure, Hicks."
219,BURKE,219,Here we go.
220,FERRO,220,"Initiate release sequencer on my
mark.  Three.  Two.  One.  Mark!"
221,FERRO,221,Switching to DCS ranging.
222,SPUNKMEYER,222,"Two-four-o.  Nominal to profile.
Picking up some hull ionization."
223,FERRO,223,Got it.  Rough air ahead.
224,FERRO,224,Stand by for some chop.
225,RIPLEY,225,"How may drops is this for you,
Lieutenant?"
226,GORMAN,226,Thirty-eight...simulated.
227,VASQUEZ,227,How many combat drops?
228,GORMAN,228,"Well...two.  Three, including
this one."
229,FERRO,229,"Turning on final.  Coming around to
a seven-zero-niner.  Terminal
guidance locked in.  Where's
the damn beacon?"
230,GORMAN,230,"Let's see.  Everybody on line.
Drake, check you camera.  There
seems to be a..."
231,GORMAN,231,"...that's better.  Pan it around
a bit."
232,APONE,232,"Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up.
Let's move.  Two minutes.
Somebody wake up Hicks."
233,RIPLEY,233,That the atmosphere processor?
234,BURKE,234,"Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so,
all over the planet.  They're
completely automated.  We
manufacture them, by the way."
235,GORMAN,235,"Hold at forty.  Slow circle of
the complex."
236,RIPLEY,236,"The structure seems intact.  They
have power."
237,GORMAN,237,"Okay, let's do it."
238,APONE,238,"Awright!  I want a nice clean
dispersal this time."
239,VASQUEZ,239,You staying in here?
240,RIPLEY,240,You bet.
241,VASQUEZ,241,Figures.
242,GORMAN,242,"Set down sixty meters this side
of the telemetry mast.  Immediate
dust off on my 'clear,' then stay
on station."
243,APONE,243,"Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!"
244,GORMAN,244,"First squad up, on line.  Hicks,
get yours in a cordon.  Watch the
rear."
245,APONE,245,"Vasquez, take point.  Let's move."
246,APONE,246,"Sealed.  Hudson, run a bypass."
247,APONE,247,"First squad, assemble on me at
the main lock."
248,GORMAN,248,"Second team, move up.
Flanking positions."
249,GORMAN,249,"Quarter and search by twos.  Second
team move inside.  Hicks, take the
upper level.  Use your motion
trackers."
250,HICKS,250,Nothing.  No movement.
251,BURKE,251,Looks like my room in college.
252,RIPLEY,252,Wait!  Tell him to...
253,RIPLEY,253,"...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left.
There!"
254,HICKS,254,"You seeing this okay?  Looks
melted."
255,BURKE,255,Hmm.  Acid for blood.
256,HICKS,256,"Looks like somebody bagged them
one of Ripley's bad guys here."
257,HUDSON,257,"Hey, if you like that, you're gonna
love this..."
258,APONE,258,Second squad?  What's your status?
259,HICKS,259,"Just finished our sweep.
Nobody home."
260,APONE,260,"The place is dead, Sir.  Whatever
happened, we missed it."
261,GORMAN,261,"All right, the area's secured.
Let's go in and see what their
computer can tell us."
262,GORMAN,262,"First team head for operations.
Hudson, see if you can get their
CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at
the south lock by the up-link
tower..."
263,GORMAN,263,...We're coming in.
264,HUDSON,264,"He's coming in.  I feel safer
already."
265,VASQUEZ,265,Pendejo jerkoff.
266,HUDSON,266,"Sir, the CPU is on-line."
267,GORMAN,267,"Okay, stand by in operations."
268,GORMAN,268,Let's go.
269,RIPLEY,269,Burke!
270,WIERZBOWSKI,270,Scare you?
271,RIPLEY,271,"Christ, Wierzbowski!"
272,WIERZBOWSKI,272,"Sorry.  Hicks said to keep an
eye on you."
273,GORMAN,273,"Looks like you company can write
off its share of this colony."
274,BURKE,274,It's insured.
275,FRONT,275,"Sir, you should check this out..."
276,FROST,276,Right ahead here...
277,WIERZBOWSKI,277,Last stand.
278,GORMAN,278,No bodies?
279,FROST,279,"No, Sir.  Looks like it was a
helluva fight."
280,RIPLEY,280,Over there.
281,BURKE,281,Are these the same...?
282,RIPLEY,282,"Watch it, Burke..."
283,HICKS,283,It likes you.
284,BURKE,284,"These are dead.  There's just
the two alive."
285,RIPLEY,285,"Removed surgically before embryo
implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk,
John L.   Died during procedure."
286,RIPLEY,286,They killed him getting it off.
287,HICKS,287,Poor bastard.
288,HICKS,288,Behind us.
289,RIPLEY,289,One of us?
290,GORMAN,290,"Apone...where are your people?
Anybody in D-Block?"
291,APONE,291,Negative.  We're all in Operations.
292,HICKS,292,It's moving.
293,VASQUEZ,293,Which way?
294,VASQUEZ,294,You fuck!
295,RIPLEY,295,Come on out.  It's all right...
296,HICKS,296,"Ow!  Shit.  Watchit, she bites."
297,RIPLEY,297,"It's okay, it's okay.  It's over...
you're going to be all right now...
it's okay...you're safe..."
298,GORMAN,298,What's her name again?
299,DIETRICH,299,Rebecca.
300,GORMAN,300,"Now think, Rebecca.
Concentrate.  Just start at
the beginning..."
301,GORMAN,301,"Where are your parents?  You
have to try..."
302,RIPLEY,302,"Gorman!  Give it a rest would
you."
303,GORMAN,303,Total brain-lock.
304,DIETRICH,304,"Physically she's okay.
Borderline malnutrition, but
I don't think any permanent
damage."
305,GORMAN,305,"Come on, we're wasting our
time."
306,RIPLEY,306,"Here, try this.  A little
instant hot chocolate."
307,RIPLEY,307,"Poor thing.  You don't talk
much do you?  That's okay by
me.  Most people do a lot of
talking and they wind up not
saying very much."
308,RIPLEY,308,"Uh oh.  I made a clean spot
here.  Now I've done it.  Guess
I'll just have to do the whole
thing."
309,RIPLEY,309,"Hard to believe...there's a
little girl under all this.
And a pretty one at that."
310,BURKE,310,What's he scanning for?
311,GORMAN,311,"PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters.
Every adult colonist had one
surgically implanted."
312,HUDSON,312,"If they're within twenty
klicks we'll read it out here,
but so far...zip."
313,RIPLEY,313,"I don't know how you managed
to stay alive but you're one
brave kid, Rebecca."
314,NEWT,314,N-newt.
315,RIPLEY,315,What did you say?
316,NEWT,316,"Newt.  My n-name's Newt.
Nobody calls me Rebecca except
my dork brother."
317,RIPLEY,317,"Well, Newt it is then.  My
name's Ripley...and people
call me Ripley."
318,RIPLEY,318,"Pleased to meet you.  And who
is this?  Does she have a
name?"
319,NEWT,319,Casey.  She's my only friend.
320,RIPLEY,320,What about me?
321,NEWT,321,I don't want you for a friend.
322,RIPLEY,322,Why not?
323,NEWT,323,"Because you'll be gone soon,
like the others.  Like
everybody.  You'll be dead
and you'll leave me alone."
324,RIPLEY,324,"Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad
went away like that, didn't
they?"
325,RIPLEY,325,"They'd be here if they could,
honey.  I know they would."
326,NEWT,326,They're dead.
327,RIPLEY,327,"Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I
won't leave you.  I promise."
328,NEWT,328,You promise?
329,RIPLEY,329,Cross my heart.
330,NEWT,330,And hope to die?
331,RIPLEY,331,And hope to die.
332,HUDSON,332,"Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and
drop your linen!  Found 'em."
333,GORMAN,333,Alive?
334,HUDSON,334,"Unknown.  But, it looks like
all of them.  Over at the
processing station...sublevel
'C' under the south tower."
335,HICKS,335,"Looks like a Goddamn town
meeting."
336,GORMAN,336,Let's saddle up.
337,APONE,337,"Awright, let's go girls, they
ain't payin' us by the hour."
338,NEWT,338,"I was the best at the game.
I knew the whole maze."
339,RIPLEY,339,"The 'maze'?  You mean the
air ducts?"
340,NEWT,340,"Yeah, you know.  In the walls,
under the floor.  I was the
ace.  I could hide better
than anybody."
341,RIPLEY,341,"You're really something, ace."
342,GORMAN,342,"Forty meters in.  Ramp on
axial two-two.  Access to
sublevels."
343,GORMAN,343,B-Level.  Next one down.
344,GORMAN,344,"We're not making that out too
well.  What is it?"
345,HUDSON,345,"You tell me.  I only work
here."
346,GORMAN,346,What is it?
347,RIPLEY,347,I don't know.
348,GORMAN,348,Proceed inside.
349,RIPLEY,349,Oh God...
350,DIETRICH,350,"Looks like some sort of secreted
resin."
351,GORMAN,351,"They ripped apart the colony
for building materials."
352,RIPLEY,352,"And the colonists...When they
were done with them."
353,RIPLEY,353,"Newt, you better go sit up
front.  Go on."
354,FROST,354,Hotter'n hell in here.
355,HUDSON,355,"Yeah...but it's a dry
heat."
356,RIPLEY,356,"They're right under the
primary heat exchangers."
357,BURKE,357,"Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like
the heat, that's why they built..."
358,RIPLEY,358,"That's not what I mean.  Gorman,
if your men have to use their
weapons in there, they'll rupture
the cooling system."
359,BURKE,359,She's right.
360,GORMAN,360,So.
361,RIPLEY,361,"So...then the fusion
containment shuts down."
362,GORMAN,362,So?  So?
363,BURKE,363,"We're talking thermonuclear
explosion."
364,GORMAN,364,Shit.
365,GORMAN,365,"Apone, collect magazines
from everybody.  We can't
have any firing in there."
366,WIERZBOWSKI,366,Is he fucking crazy?
367,HUDSON,367,"What're we supposed to use,
man?  Harsh language?"
368,GORMAN,368,"Flame-units only.  I want
rifles slung."
369,APONE,369,Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
370,HICKS,370,"I always keep this handy.
For close encounter."
371,APONE,371,"Let's move.  Hicks, back
us up."
372,GORMAN,372,Any movement?
373,HUDSON,373,Nothing.  Zip.
374,DIETRICH,374,Sir!
375,WOMAN,375,Please...God...kill me.
376,APONE,376,Flame thrower!  Move!
377,HUDSON,377,Movement!
378,APONE,378,Position?
379,HUDSON,379,Can't lock up...
380,APONE,380,"Talk to me, Hudson."
381,HUDSON,381,"Uh, seems to be in front
and behind."
382,GORMAN,382,"We can't see anything back
here, Apone.  What's going on?"
383,RIPLEY,383,"Pull you team out, Gorman."
384,APONE,384,"Go to infrared.  Looks sharp
people!"
385,HUDSON,385,"Multiple signals.  All round.
Closing."
386,VASQUEZ,386,Let's rock.
387,GORMAN,387,"Who's firing?  I ordered a
hold fire, dammit!"
388,HUDSON,388,"Let's get the fuck out of
here!"
389,HICKS,389,"Not that tunnel, the other
one!"
390,CROWE,390,"You sure?  Watch it...behind
you.  Fucking move, will you!"
391,RIPLEY,391,"GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO
IT NOW!"
392,GORMAN,392,Shut up.  Just shut up!
393,GORMAN,393,"Uh,...Apone, I want you to
lay down a suppressing fire
with the incinerators and
fall back by squads to the
APC, over."
394,APONE,394,"Say again?  All after
incinerators?"
395,GORMAN,395,I said...
396,GORMAN,396,"...lay down (garbled) ...by
squads to...(garbled)"
397,APONE,397,"Dietrich?  Crowe?  Sound
off!  Wierzbowski?"
398,HUDSON,398,"We're getting juked!  We're
gonna die in here!"
399,APONE,399,"Yeah.  Right.  Right!  Fuck
the heat exchanger!"
400,GORMAN,400,I told them to fall back...
401,RIPLEY,401,They're but off!  Do something!
402,RIPLEY,402,"Newt, put your seatbelt on!"
403,GORMAN,403,"Ripley, what the hell...?"
404,GORMAN,404,"What are you doing?  Turn
around!  That's an order!"
405,VASQUEZ,405,Drake!  He's down!
406,HICKS,406,"He's gone!  Forget it, he's
gone!"
407,VASQUEZ,407,"No.. No, he's not.  He's --"
408,HICKS,408,Let's go!
409,HICKS,409,Get on the Goddamn door!
410,HICKS,410,"It's okay...we're clear.  We're
clear.  Ease up."
411,HICKS,411,"Sounds like a blown transaxle.
You're just grinding metal."
412,RIPLEY,412,Newt?  Where's Newt?
413,RIPLEY,413,You okay?
414,HUDSON,414,"Jesus...Jesus...I don't believe
it."
415,HUDSON,415,"I'm all right, leave it!"
416,HICKS,416,He's alive.  I think he's paralyzed.
417,VASQUEZ,417,He's fucking dead!
418,VASQUEZ,418,"Wake up pendejo!  I'm gonna kill
you, you useless fuck!"
419,HICKS,419,"Hold it.  Hold it.  Back off, right
now."
420,RIPLEY,420,Looks like it stung him.
421,HUDSON,421,"Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and
Dietrich aren't dead, man."
422,HUDSON,422,"They must be like Gorman.  Their
signs are real low but they ain't
dead!"
423,RIPLEY,423,"You can't help them.  Right now
they're being cocooned just like
the others."
424,HUDSON,424,"Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't
happening."
425,SPUNKMEYER,425,Need anything else?
426,VASQUEZ,426,"All right, we can't blow the fuck
out of them...why not roll some
canisters of CN-20 down there.
Nerve gas the whole nest?"
427,HUDSON,427,"Look, man, let's just bug out and
call it even, okay?"
428,RIPLEY,428,"No good.  How do we know it'll
effect their biochemistry?  I say
we take off and nuke the entire
site from orbit.  It's the only
way to be sure."
429,BURKE,429,"Now hold on a second.  I'm not
authorizing that action."
430,RIPLEY,430,Why not?
431,BURKE,431,"Well, I mean...I know this is an
emotional moment, but let's not
make snap judgments.  Let's move
cautiously.  First, this physical
installation had a substantial
dollar value attached to it --"
432,RIPLEY,432,"They can bill me.  I got a tab
running.  What's second?"
433,BURKE,433,"This is clearly an important
species we're dealing with here.
We can't just arbitrarily
exterminate them --"
434,RIPLEY,434,Bullshit!
435,VASQUEZ,435,"Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us."
436,HUDSON,436,"Maybe you haven't been keeping up
on current events, but we just got
out asses kicked, pal!"
437,RIPLEY,437,"Look, Burke.  We had an agreement."
438,BURKE,438,"I know, I know, but we're dealing
with changing scenarios here.  This
thing is major, Ripley.  I mean
really major.  You gotta go with
its energy.  Since you are the
representative of the company who
discovered this species your
percentage will naturally be
some serious, serious money."
439,RIPLEY,439,You son of a bitch.
440,BURKE,440,"Don't make me pull rank, Ripley."
441,RIPLEY,441,"What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks
has authority here."
442,BURKE,442,Corporal Hicks!?
443,RIPLEY,443,"This operation is under military
jurisdiction and Hicks is next in
chain of command.  Right?"
444,HICKS,444,Looks that way.
445,BURKE,445,"Look, this is a multimillion
dollar operation.  He can't make
that kind of decision.  He's just
a grunt!"
446,BURKE,446,No offense.
447,HICKS,447,None taken.
448,HICKS,448,"Ferro, you copying?"
449,FERRO,449,Standing by.
450,HICKS,450,"Prep for dust-off.  We're gonna
need an immediate evac."
451,HICKS,451,"I think we'll take off and nuke
the site from orbit.  It's the
only way to be sure."
452,BURKE,452,"This is absurd!  You don't have
the authority to --"
453,RIPLEY,453,"We're going home, honey."
454,FERRO,454,Spunkmeyer?  Goddammit.
455,FERRO,455,Where the fu --
456,RIPLEY,456,Run!
457,HUDSON,457,"Well that's great!  That's just
fucking great, man.  Now what the
fuck are we supposed to do, man?
We're in some real pretty shit now!"
458,HICKS,458,Are you finished?
459,HICKS,459,You okay?
460,NEWT,460,"I guess we're not leaving, right?"
461,RIPLEY,461,"I'm sorry, Newt."
462,NEWT,462,"You don't have to be sorry.  It
wasn't your fault."
463,HUDSON,463,"Just tell me what the fuck we're
supposed to do now.  What're we
gonna do now?"
464,BURKE,464,"May be could build a fire and
sing songs."
465,NEWT,465,"We should get back, 'cause it'll
be dark soon.  They come mostly
at night.  Mostly."
466,HICKS,466,"This is all we could salvage.  We've
got four pulse-rifles with about
fifty rounds each.  Not so good.
About fifteen M-40 grenades and
two flame throwers less than
half full...one damaged.  And
We've got four of these
robot-sentry units with scanners
and display intact."
467,RIPLEY,467,"How long after we're declared
overdue can we expect a rescue?"
468,HICKS,468,About seventeen days.
469,HUDSON,469,"Man, we're not going to make it
seventeen hours!  Those things
are going to come in here, just
like they did before, man...
they're going to come in here
and get us, man, long before..."
470,RIPLEY,470,"She survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training."
471,RIPLEY,471,"So you better just start dealing
with it.  Just deal with it,
Hudson...because we need you and
I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now
get on a terminal and call up some
kind of floor plan file.
Construction blueprints,
maintenance schematics, anything
that shows the layout of this
place.  I want to see air ducts,
electrical access tunnels,
subbasements.  Every possible way
into this wing."
472,HUDSON,472,Aye-firmative.  I'm on it.
473,BISHOP,473,"I'll be in medical.  I'd like to
continue my analysis."
474,RIPLEY,474,Fine.  You do that.
475,RIPLEY,475,"This service tunnel is how they're
moving back and forth."
476,HUDSON,476,"Yeah, right, it runs from the
processing station right into
the sublevel here."
477,RIPLEY,477,"All right.  There's a fire door
at this end.  The first thing we
do is put a remote sentry in the
tunnel and seal that door."
478,HICKS,478,"We gotta figure on them getting
into the complex."
479,RIPLEY,479,"That's right.  So we put up
welded barricades at these
intersections..."
480,RIPLEY,480,"...and seal these ducts here
and here.  Then they can only
come at us from these two
corridors and we create a free
field of fire for the other
two sentry units, here."
481,HICKS,481,"Outstanding.  Then all we need's
a deck of cards.  All right, let's
move like we got a purpose."
482,HUDSON,482,Aye-firmative.
483,NEWT,483,Aye-firmative!
484,VASQUEZ,484,Testing!
485,HUDSON,485,"Hudson here.  A and B
sentries are in place and
keyed.  We're sealing the
tunnel."
486,HICKS,486,Roger.
487,HICKS,487,"Here, put this on.  Then
I can locate you anywhere
in the complex on this --"
488,HICKS,488,"Just a...precaution.  You
know."
489,RIPLEY,489,Thanks.
490,HUDSON,490,"Uh, what's next?"
491,RIPLEY,491,"Now you just lie here and
have a nap.  You're exhausted."
492,NEWT,492,"I don't want to...I have
scary dreams."
493,RIPLEY,493,"I'll bet Casey doesn't have
bad dreams."
494,RIPLEY,494,"Nothing bad in here.  Maybe
you could just try to be like
her."
495,NEWT,495,"Ripley...she doesn't have
bad dreams because she's just
a piece of plastic."
496,RIPLEY,496,"Oh.  Sorry, Newt."
497,NEWT,497,"My mommy always said there
were no monsters.  No real
ones.  But there are."
498,RIPLEY,498,"Yes, there are, aren't there."
499,NEWT,499,"Why do they tell little kids
that?"
500,RIPLEY,500,"Well, some kids can't handle
it like you can."
501,NEWT,501,"Did one of those things grow
inside her?"
502,RIPLEY,502,"I don't know, Newt.  That's
the truth."
503,NEWT,503,"Isn't that how babies come?
I mean people babies...they
grow inside you?"
504,RIPLEY,504,"No, it's different, honey."
505,NEWT,505,Did you ever have a baby?
506,RIPLEY,506,Yes.  A little girl.
507,NEWT,507,Where is she?
508,RIPLEY,508,Gone.
509,NEWT,509,You mean dead.
510,NEWT,510,"Ripley, I was just thinking...
Maybe I could do you a favor and
fill in for her.  Just for a
while.  You can try it and if
you don't like it, it's okay.
I'll understand.  No big deal.
Whattya think?"
511,RIPLEY,511,"I think it's not the worst idea
I've heard all day.  Let's talk
about it later."
512,NEWT,512,Don't go!  Please.
513,RIPLEY,513,"I'll be right in the other
room, Newt.  And look...I can
see you on that camera right
up there."
514,RIPLEY,514,"Here.  Take is for luck.  Now
go to sleep...and don't dream."
515,RIPLEY,515,How is he?
516,BISHOP,516,"I've isolated a neuro-muscular
toxin responsible for the
paralysis.  It seems to be
metabolizing.  He should wake
up soon."
517,RIPLEY,517,"Now let me get this straight.
The aliens paralyzed the colonists,
carried them over there,
cocooned them to be hosts for
more of those..."
518,RIPLEY,518,"Which would mean lots of
those parasites, right?  One
for each person...over a hundred
at least."
519,BISHOP,519,Yes.  That follows.
520,RIPLEY,520,"But these things come from
eggs...so where are all the
eggs coming from."
521,BISHOP,521,"That is the question of the
hour.  We could assume a parallel
to certain insect forms who
have hivelike organization.
An ant of termite colony, for
example, is ruled by a single
female, a queen, which is the
source of new eggs."
522,RIPLEY,522,"You're saying one of those things
lays all the eggs?"
523,BISHOP,523,"Well, the queen is always physically
larger then the others.  A
termite queen's abdomen is so
bloated with eggs that it can't
move at all.  It is fed and tended
by drone workers, defended by
the warriors.  She is the center
of their lives, quite literally
the  mother of their society."
524,RIPLEY,524,Could it be intelligent?
525,BISHOP,525,"Hard to say.  It may have been
blind instinct...attraction to
the heat of whatever...but she
did choose to incubate her eggs
in the one spot where we couldn't
destroy her without destroying
ourselves.  That's if she exists,
of course."
526,RIPLEY,526,"I want those specimens destroyed
as soon as you're done with them.
You understand?"
527,BISHOP,527,"Mr. Burke have instructions
that they were to be kept alive
in stasis for return to the
company labs.  He was very specific."
528,RIPLEY,528,Burke!
529,BURKE,529,"Those specimens are worth
millions to the bio-weapons
division.  Now, if you're smart
we can both come out of this
heroes.  Set up for life."
530,RIPLEY,530,"You just try getting a dangerous
organism past ICC quarantine.
Section 22350 of the Commerce Code."
531,BURKE,531,"You've been doing your homework.
Look, they can't impound it if
they don't know about it."
532,RIPLEY,532,"But they will know about it, Burke.
From me.  Just like they'll know
how you were responsible for the
deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven
colonists here --"
533,BURKE,533,"Now, wait a second --"
534,RIPLEY,534,"You sent them to that ship.  I
just checked the colony log...
directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine.
Signed Burke, Carter J."
535,RIPLEY,535,"You sent them out there and you
didn't even warn them, Burke.
Why didn't you warn them?"
536,BURKE,536,"Look, maybe the thing didn't even
exist, right?  And if I'd made it
a major security situation, the
Administration would've stepped
in.  Then no exclusive rights,
nothing."
537,BURKE,537,"It was a bad call, that's all."
538,RIPLEY,538,"Bad call?  These people are fucking
dead, Burke!  Well, they're going
to nail your hide to the shed...
and I'll be there when they do."
539,BURKE,539,"I expected more of you, Ripley.
I thought you would be smarter
than this."
540,RIPLEY,540,Sorry to disappoint you.
541,HICKS,541,"They're coming.  They're in
the tunnel."
542,HICKS,542,"Guns A and B.  Tracking and firing
on multiple targets."
543,HUDSON,543,"They must be wall to wall in
there.  Look  at those ammo counters
go.  It's a shooting gallery down
there."
544,HICKS,544,"B gun's dry.  Twenty on A.
Ten.  Five.  That's it."
545,RIPLEY,545,They're at the fire door.
546,HUDSON,546,"Man, listen to that."
547,BISHOP,547,"Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have
some bad news."
548,HUDSON,548,"Well, that's a switch."
549,BISHOP,549,"That's it.  See it?  Emergency
venting."
550,RIPLEY,550,How long until it blows?
551,BISHOP,551,"I'm projecting total systems
failure in a little under four
hours.  The blast radius will be
about thirty kilometers.  About
equal to ten megatons."
552,HICKS,552,We got problems.
553,HUDSON,553,"I don't fucking believe this.
Do you believe this?"
554,RIPLEY,554,And it's too late to shut it down?
555,BISHOP,555,"I'm afraid so.  The crash did too
much damage.  The overload is
inevitable, at this point."
556,HUDSON,556,"Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short,
too!  Four more weeks and out.
Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin'
rock.  It ain't half fair, man!"
557,VASQUEZ,557,"Hudson, give us a break."
558,RIPLEY,558,"We need the other drop-ship.  The
on one the Sulaco.  We have to
bring it down on remote, somehow."
559,HUDSON,559,"How?  The transmitter was on the
APC.  It's wasted."
560,RIPLEY,560,"I don't care how!  Think of a
way.  Think of something."
561,HUDSON,561,Think of what?  We're fucked.
562,RIPLEY,562,"What about the colony transmitter?
That up-link tower down at the
other end.  Why can't we use that?"
563,BISHOP,563,"I checked.  The hard wiring
between here and there was severed
in the fighting."
564,RIPLEY,564,"Well then somebody's just going
to have to go out there.  Take a
portable terminal and go out there
and plug in manually."
565,HUDSON,565,"Oh, right!  Right!  With those
things running around.  No way."
566,BISHOP,566,I'll go.
567,RIPLEY,567,What?
568,BISHOP,568,"I'm really the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship anyway.
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I
may be synthetic but I'm not stupid."
569,RIPLEY,569,"All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll
you need?"
570,VASQUEZ,570,Listen.  It's stopped.
571,HICKS,571,"Well, they're into the complex."
572,BISHOP,572,"This duct runs almost to the
up-link assembly.  One hundred
eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes
to crawl down there.  One hour
to patch in and align the antenna.
Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
then about fifty minutes flight time."
573,RIPLEY,573,"It's going to be closer.  You
better get going."
574,BISHOP,574,See you soon.
575,HICKS,575,They're in the approach corridor.
576,RIPLEY,576,On my way.
577,HICKS,577,"Twenty meters and closing.
Fifteen.  C and D guns down
about fifty percent."
578,RIPLEY,578,Now many?
579,HICKS,579,"Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's
down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out."
580,RIPLEY,580,"They retreated.  The guns stopped
them."
581,HICKS,581,Yeah.  But look...
582,HICKS,582,"Newt time then can walk right
up and knock."
583,RIPLEY,583,"But they don't know that.  They're
probably looking for other ways
to get in.  That'll take them awhile."
584,HUDSON,584,Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
585,HICKS,585,"I want you two walking the perimeter.
I know we're all in strung out
shape but stay frosty and alert.
We've got to stop any entries before
they get out of hand."
586,HICKS,586,"How long since you slept?
Twenty-four hours?"
587,RIPLEY,587,They'll get us.
588,HICKS,588,Maybe.  Maybe not.
589,RIPLEY,589,"Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like
those others.  You'll take care of
it won't you, it if comes to that?"
590,HICKS,590,"If it comes to that, I'll do us
both.  Let's see that it doesn't
Here, I'd like to introduce you to
a close personal friend of mine."
591,HICKS,591,"M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and
under with a 30mm pump-action
grenade launcher."
592,RIPLEY,592,What do I do?
593,HICKS,593,"Just pull it in real right.  It
will kick some.  When the counter
here heads zero, hit this..."
594,HICKS,594,"Just let it drop right out.  Get
the other one in quick.  Just
slap it in hard, it likes abuse.
Now, pull the bolt."
595,HICKS,595,You're ready again.
596,RIPLEY,596,What's this?
597,HICKS,597,"Well, that's the grenade launcher
...you probably don't want to
mess with that."
598,RIPLEY,598,"Look, you started this.  Now show
me everything.  I can handle myself."
599,HICKS,599,Yeah.  I've noticed.
600,RIPLEY,600,How do you feel?
601,GORMAN,601,"All right, I guess.  One hell
of a hangover.  Look, Ripley...
I..."
602,RIPLEY,602,Forget it.
603,GORMAN,603,You still want to kill me?
604,VASQUEZ,604,It won't be necessary.
605,RIPLEY,605,"There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all
right."
606,BISHOP,606,"Now, if I did it right..."
607,FEMALE VOICE,607,"Attention.  Attention.  Automatic
fueling operations have begun.
Please extinguish all smoking
materials."
608,RIPLEY,608,"Newt.  Newt, wake up."
609,NEWT,609,Wah...?  Where are...?
610,RIPLEY,610,"Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in
trouble."
611,RIPLEY,611,Hey...hey!
612,RIPLEY,612,Hicks!  Hicks!
613,HICKS,613,"Roger.  Check back when you've
activated the ship."
614,HICKS,614,He's at the up-link tower.
615,BURKE,615,Excellent.
616,NEWT,616,Mommy...mommmyyyyy...
617,NEWT,617,"Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm
scared."
618,RIPLEY,618,"I know, honey.  Me too."
619,HICKS,619,"Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in
medical!  We got a fire!"
620,HICKS,620,The corner!  Ready?
621,HUDSON,621,Do it!
622,RIPLEY,622,Burke...it was Burke.
623,HUDSON,623,"I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now!"
624,HICKS,624,"I don't get it.  It doesn't
make any Goddamn sense."
625,RIPLEY,625,"He wanted an alien, only he
couldn't get it back through
quarantine.  But if we were impregnated
...whatever you call it...and then
frozen for the trip back at just
the right time...then nobody would
know about the embryos we were carrying.
We and Newt."
626,HICKS,626,Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
627,RIPLEY,627,"The only way it would work is if
he sabotaged certain freezers
on the trip back.  Then he could
jettison the bodies and make up
any story he liked."
628,HUDSON,628,Fuuuck!  He's dead.
629,HUDSON,629,"You're dogmeat, pal."
630,BURKE,630,"This is total paranoid delusion.
It's pitiful."
631,RIPLEY,631,"You know, Burke, I don't know
which species is worse.  You don't
see them screwing each other over
for a fucking percentage."
632,HICKS,632,Let's waste him.
633,HICKS,633,No offense.
634,RIPLEY,634,"Just find someplace to lock him
up until it's time to --"
635,RIPLEY,635,They cut the power.
636,HUDSON,636,"What do you mean, they cut the
power?  How could they cut the
power, man?  They're animals."
637,RIPLEY,637,Newt!  Stay close.
638,RIPLEY,638,"Let's get some trackers going.
Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch
Burke."
639,RIPLEY,639,Anything?
640,HUDSON,640,There's something.
641,HUDSON,641,It's inside the complex.
642,VASQUEZ,642,You're just reading me.
643,HUDSON,643,"No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're
inside.  Inside the perimeter.
They're in here."
644,RIPLEY,644,"Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez?"
645,VASQUEZ,645,Hudson may be right.
646,HICKS,646,It's game time.
647,RIPLEY,647,"Get back here, both of you.  Fall
back to Operations."
648,HUDSON,648,"This signal's weird...must be
some interference or something.
There's movement all over the
place..."
649,RIPLEY,649,Just get back here!
650,HUDSON,650,Movement!  Signal's clean.
651,HUDSON,651,Range twenty meters.
652,RIPLEY,652,Seal the door.
653,HUDSON,653,Seventeen meters.
654,HICKS,654,Let's get these things lit.
655,RIPLEY,655,"They learned.  They cut the power
and avoided the guns.  They must
have found another way in, something
we missed."
656,HICKS,656,We didn't miss anything.
657,HUDSON,657,Fifteen meters.
658,RIPLEY,658,"I don't know, an acid hole in
a duct.  Something under the
floors, not on the plans.
I don't know!"
659,HUDSON,659,"Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big
fucking signal.  Ten meters."
660,RIPLEY,660,"They're right on us.  Vasquez,
how you doing?"
661,HUDSON,661,Nine meters.  Eight.
662,RIPLEY,662,Can't be.  That's inside the room!
663,HUDSON,663,It's readin' right.  Look!
664,HICKS,664,Well you're not reading it right!
665,HUDSON,665,Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
666,RIPLEY,666,Medical!  Get to medical!
667,RIPLEY,667,Burke!  Open the door!
668,NEWT,668,Look!
669,HUDSON,669,Let's go!  Let's go!
670,HICKS,670,Fuckin' A!
671,HICKS,671,Hold you fire!
672,RIPLEY,672,Locked.
673,HICKS,673,Stand back.
674,GORMAN,674,You can't use those in here!
675,VASQUEZ,675,Right.  Fire in the hole!
676,HICKS,676,Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit.
677,VASQUEZ,677,What?
678,NEWT,678,Come on!  This way.
679,RIPLEY,679,Stay behind me.
680,NEWT,680,Come on.  Crawl faster.
681,RIPLEY,681,"DO you know how to get to the
landing field from here?"
682,NEWT,682,Sure.  Go left.
683,NEWT,683,Go right.
684,HICKS,684,"Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over."
685,BISHOP,685,"Yes, I read you.  Not very well..."
686,BISHOP,686,"The ship is on its way.  ETA
about sixteen minutes.  I've
got my hands full flying...
the weather's come up a bit."
687,HICKS,687,"All right, stand by there.  We're
on out way.  Over."
688,RIPLEY,688,Back.  Go back!
689,VASQUEZ,689,Losing fuel.
690,VASQUEZ,690,"You always were an asshole, Gorman."
691,NEWT,691,"This way.  Come on, we're almost
there!"
692,RIPLEY,692,"Newt, wait!"
693,NEWT,693,Here!  Go up.
694,NEWT,694,Just up there --
695,NEWT,695,Riiiiipppleee --
696,RIPLEY,696,Newt!
697,NEWT,697,Mommy...where are you?
698,NEWT,698,Moooommeeee...
699,RIPLEY,699,"Hicks, get down here.  I need
that locator."
700,RIPLEY,700,Newt!  Star wherever you are!
701,HICKS,701,This way.  We're close...
702,NEWT,702,Here!  I'm here.  I'm here.
703,RIPLEY,703,"Climb down, honey.  We have to
cut through this grate."
704,RIPLEY,704,Newt!  Newt!
705,RIPLEY,705,No!  Noooo!
706,HICKS,706,She's gone!  Let's go!
707,RIPLEY,707,"No!  No!  She's alive!  We
have to --"
708,HICKS,708,"All right!  She's alive.  I
believe it.  But we gotta get
moving!  Now!"
709,RIPLEY,709,"Come on, you can make it.
Almost there."
710,RIPLEY,710,HOW MUCH TIME?
711,BISHOP,711,PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
712,RIPLEY,712,WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
713,BISHOP,713,Ripley...
714,RIPLEY,714,"She's alive.  They brought her
here and you know it."
715,BISHOP,715,"In seventeen minutes this place
will be a cloud of vapor the
size of Nebraska."
716,RIPLEY,716,"Hicks, don't let him leave."
717,HICKS,717,We ain't going anywhere.
718,RIPLEY,718,"See you, Hicks."
719,HICKS,719,Dwayne.  It's Dwayne.
720,RIPLEY,720,Ellen.
721,HICKS,721,"Don't be long, Ellen."
722,VOICE,722,"Attention.  Emergency.  All
personnel must evacuate
immediately.  You now have
fourteen minutes to reach
minimum safe distance."
723,BURKE,723,"Ripley...help me.  I can feel
it...inside.  Oh, God...it's
moving!  Oh gooood..."
724,RIPLEY,724,Here.
725,VOICE,725,"You now have eleven minutes to
reach minimum safe distance."
726,NEWT,726,I knew you'd come.
727,RIPLEY,727,"Newt, I want you to hang on,
now.  Hang on tight."
728,VOICE,728,"You now have two minutes
to reach minimum safe
distance."
729,RIPLEY,729,BISHOP!
730,RIPLEY,730,BISHOP!
731,RIPLEY,731,"Close your eyes, baby."
732,VOICE,732,"You now have thirty seconds to
reach..."
733,RIPLEY,733,"Punch it, Bishop!"
734,RIPLEY,734,"It's okay, baby.  We made it.  It's
over."
735,BISHOP,735,"I gave him a shot, for the pain.
We'll need to get a stretcher to
cart him up to medical."
736,BISHOP,736,"I'm sorry if I gave you a scare
but that platform was just becoming
too unstable..."
737,BISHOP,737,"I had to circle and hope things
didn't get too rough to take you
off."
738,RIPLEY,738,"You did okay, Bishop."
739,BISHOP,739,"Well, thanks, I --"
740,RIPLEY,740,Go!
741,RIPLEY,741,Here!
742,RIPLEY,742,"Get away from her, you bitch!"
743,RIPLEY,743,Come on!
744,BISHOP,744,Not bad for a human.
745,NEWT,745,Mommy...Mommy?
746,RIPLEY,746,"Right here, baby.  Right here."
747,NEWT,747,Are we going to sleep now?
748,RIPLEY,748,That's right.
749,NEWT,749,Can we dream?
750,RIPLEY,750,"Yes, honey.  I think we both can."
