200 dollars a ton -- sugar !"
1,LAWYER,1,What about oil ?
2,CHARLIE,2,"Food, oil --look, let me show you
something. This is the economy of
the United States in two years --"

9,ACCOUNTANT,9,What's to prevent it ?
10,CHARLIE,10,"Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you,
I didn't build a two-billion-dollar
company in the last twenty years
by doing nothing. We can protect
our interests."
11,CHARLIE,11,"We are still the most powerful
nation in the world. Militarily."
12,CHARLIE,12,"You know bodyguard; he was a
captain in Viet Nam. You talk to
him, except he won't talk. This
kind of man can kill you with his
pinky. A nice quiet fella, though."
13,CHARLIE,13,"Carries a attache case at all
times. You know what's in it ?"
14,CHARLIE,14,An Ingram Machine pistol.
15,CHARLIE,15,CHARLIE					WILLARD (V.O.)
16,WILLARD (V.O.),16,"The attache case has been empty
for three years, but it makes him
safe to think there's a machine
pistol in it.
I don't like automatic weapons.
They jam.
I saw a friend of mine get
ripped open because he flicked his
M-16 to automatic, and it jammed.
How much money did the contractors
make on the M-16 ?"
17,WILLARD (V.O.),17,"He likes to hear stories about Nam.
I tell him I can't; they're not
cleared. The truth is he wouldn't
understand."
18,WILLARD (V.O.),18,"There's no way I can tell them...
what really happened over there.
I wouldn't've believed it if
someone'd told me."
19,WILLARD (V.O.),19,"There was only one part that
mattered -- for me, anyway. I
don't even know if I remember
all of it. I can't remember
how it ended, exactly -- because
when it ended I was insane."
20,WILLARD (V.O.),20,"But I know how it started
for me -- I was on R. and R.
in Saigon; my first time south
of the DMZ in three months. I
wasn't sure, but I thought this
guy was following me."
21,CAPTAIN,21,How about a drink ?
22,WILLARD,22,"Sure, thanks."
23,CAPTAIN,23,Winning the war by yourself.
24,WILLARD,24,Part.
25,CAPTAIN,25,Which part is that ?
26,WILLARD,26,My part.
27,WILLARD,27,"Beer, with ice and water."
28,CAPTAIN,28,That's good gin.
29,WILLARD,29,"I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis."
30,CAPTAIN,30,Delta ?
31,WILLARD,31,No.
32,CAPTAIN,32,North ?
33,WILLARD,33,Yeah. Way north.
34,CAPTAIN,34,What unit were you with ?
35,WILLARD,35,None.
36,CAPTAIN,36,"Rangers, eh?"
37,WILLARD,37,Sort of.
38,CAPTAIN,38,Were you Longe Range Recon --
39,WILLARD,39,"No -- I worked too far north for
LRRP."
40,CAPTAIN,40,That's quite an array of ribbons...
41,WILLARD,41,Let's talk about you.
42,CAPTAIN,42,I was an FO for the 25th.
43,WILLARD,43,Tracks ?
44,CAPTAIN,44,Yeah.
45,WILLARD,45,Fat. That's real fat.
46,CAPTAIN,46,Sometimes.
47,WILLARD,47,"At least you always have enough
water. How many gallons does
each one of those damn things
carry ?"
48,CAPTAIN,48,Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
49,WILLARD,49,"You know, I can remember once,
getting back below the DMZ -- and
the first Americans we ran into
were a track squadron. I just
couldn't believe how much water
they had. We'd been chewing
bamboo shoots for almost a week,
and before that, for two weeks,
we'd been drinking anything --
rain water, river shit, stuff
right out of the paddies. And
there were these guys standing
by their trucks spilling water
all over. I could've killed them."
50,WILLARD,50,"I swear to God I would have, too,
if ..."
51,CAPTAIN,51,"I didn't know we had units up
there in North Vietnam."
52,WILLARD,52,We do.
53,CAPTAIN,53,How long were you up there ?
54,WILLARD,54,A long time.
55,CAPTAIN,55,A year ? Waiter another beer.
56,WILLARD,56,"I go up on missions. Listen
Captain, buy me all the beer
you want, but you better tell
that asshole over there you're
not going to find out anymore
about me."
57,WILLARD,57,What do you want ?
58,CIVILIAN,58,"If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon
Group, we'd like you to come with
us."
59,WILLARD,59,Whose orders ?
60,CAPTAIN,60,"Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th
A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --
Com-Sec -- Intelligence --
Nha Trang."
61,WILLARD,61,Who are you ?
62,CIVILIAN,62,The agency.
63,WILLARD (V.O.),63,"They took me to some place outside
Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters
for all operations in South East Asia.
I'd worked for Intelligence before --"
64,WILLARD,64,"Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
reporting as ordered, sir."
65,COLONEL (O.S.),65,"Okay, Willard, sit down."
66,COLONEL,66,"Have you ever seen this officer
before, Captain Willard ?"
67,WILLARD,67,"No, sir."
68,COLONEL,68,This gentleman or myself ?
69,WILLARD,69,"No, sir."
70,COLONEL,70,"I believe on your last job you
executed a tax collector in Kontum,
is that right ?"
71,WILLARD,71,"I am not presently disposed to
discuss that, sir."
72,MAJOR,72,Very good.
73,COLONEL,73,"You know much about about Special Forces;
Green Berets, Captain ?"
74,WILLARD,74,"I've worked with them on occasions
and I saw the movie , sir."
75,COLONEL,75,"Then you can appreciate Command's
concern over their -- shall we say
'erratic' methods of operation."
76,COLONEL,76,"I have never favored elite units,
Captain, including your paratroopers
or whatever. Just because a man
jumps out of an airplane or wears
a silly hat doesn't give him any
priviliges in my book -- not in
this man's army."
77,MAJOR,77,"We didn't need 'em in Korea --
no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy
and an M-1 Garand, none of this
fancy crap -- no sir."
78,CIVILIAN,78,Major.
79,COLONEL,79,"We have Special Forces A
detachments all along the
Cambodian border. Two here and
another one here -- twelve or
fourteen Americans -- pretty
much on their own; they train
and motivate Montagnard natives;
pick their own operations. If
they need something, they call
for it, and get it within
reason. What we're concerned
with is here."
80,COLONEL,80,"The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
It was originally a larger base,
built up along the river in an
old Cambodian fortress.
The area has been relatively
quiet for the past two years --
but --"
81,COLONEL,81,"... Captain, we know something's
going on up there -- Major --"
82,MAJOR,82,"Communications naturally dwindled
with the lack of V.C. activity,
this is routine, expected ... but
six months ago communication
virtually stopped."
83,COLONEL,83,"About the same time -- large numbers
of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent
began leaving the area -- this in
itself is not unusual since these
people have fought with the Rhade
Tribe that lived in the area for
centuries. But what is unusual is
that we began to find Rhade refugees
too -- in the same sampans as the
M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid
of V.C. They've put up with war
for twenty years -- but something
is driving them out."
84,MAJOR,84,"We communicate with the base
infrequently. What they call for
are air strikes, immediate --
always at night. And we don't
know what or who the air strikes
are called on."
85,WILLARD,85,Who ?
86,MAJOR,86,"You see, no one has really gone
into this area and come back alive."
87,WILLARD,87,Why me ?
88,MAJOR,88,"Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,
Special Forces. We understand
you knew him."
89,WILLARD,89,Yeah.
90,COLONEL,90,"He's commanding the detachment
at Nu Mung Ba."
91,VOICE (ON TAPE),91,"Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick --
Mark flare -- affirmative damn --
Immediate receive -- hearing
automatic weapons fire man ..."
92,SECOND VOICE,92,"Blue Delta five
This Big Rhine -- three
Need that ordinance immediately
Goddamn give it to me immediate
Christ -- Big Rhino --
Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn."
93,THIRD VOICE,93,This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta.
94,MAJOR,94,That's Colonel Kurtz.
95,KURTZ (V.O.),95,"I want that napalm dropped in the
trees -- spread it among the
branches.
We'll give you a flare -- an
orange one -- bright orange."
96,KURTZ (V.O.),96,"We'd also like some white phosporous,
Blue Delta. White phosporous, give
it to me."
97,WILLARD,97,I only met Kurtz once.
98,CIVILIAN,98,Would he remember you ?
99,WILLARD,99,Maybe.
100,COLONEL,100,What was your impression of him ?
101,CIVILIAN,101,You didn't like him.
102,WILLARD,102,Anyone got a cigarette.
103,WILLARD,103,I thought he was a lame.
104,COLONEL,104,A lame ?
105,WILLARD,105,"This is years ago, before he
joined Special Forces, I guess.
We had an argument."
106,COLONEL,106,About what ?
107,WILLARD,107,"I don't know. He was a lame,
that's all."
108,COLONEL,108,But why ?
109,WILLARD,109,"He couldn't get through a
sentence without all these
big words; about why we kill."
110,COLONEL,110,"Well, he's killing now."
111,WILLARD,111,Maybe.
112,CIVILIAN,112,What does that mean ?
113,WILLARD,113,"Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't
believe he's capable of that.
I just don't believe it."
114,COLONEL,114,It's got to be Kurtz.
115,CIVILIAN,115,"The point is that Kurtz or
somebody attacked a South
Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three
days ago. Last week a Recon
helicopter was lost in the area --
another took heavy damage --
direct fire from their base
camp."
116,WILLARD,116,Our Recon flight ?
117,CIVILIAN,117,Ours.
118,WILLARD,118,Touchy.
119,CIVILIAN,119,"You can see, of course, the
implications, if any of this --
even rumours leaked out."
120,WILLARD,120,"You want me to clean it up --
simple and quiet."
121,CIVILIAN,121,"Exactly -- you'll go up the
Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. --
appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by
accident, re-establish your
acquintance with Colonel Kurtz,
find out what's happened -- and
why. Then terminate his command."
122,WILLARD,122,Terminate ?
123,CIVILIAN,123,Terminate with extreme prejudice.
124,WILLARD (V.O.),124,"I met the P.B.R. crew; they were
pretty much all kids, except for
Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's
Mate Third Class L. Johnson --
Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate
Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef --
Radio Operator Second Class T.
Miller; they called him Mr. Clean."
125,WILLARD,125,"Chief, try to keep out of where
we're going -- Why we're goin' and
what's gonna be the big surprise."
126,CHIEF,126,"All right with me, I used to drive
a taxi."
127,WILLARD,127,Let's go.
128,CHIEF,128,"The Delta closes off to us about
ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll
be able to pick up some supplies --
bit I think there are only two
points we can draw enough water
to get into the Nung River. It's
all Charlie's turf from there on
out."
129,WILLARD,129,"We're gonna have some help to
get in the river. You know
these waters, Chief ?"
130,CHIEF,130,"'Bout six months ago I took a man
up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was
regular Army too. Shot himself
in the head. I brought his body
back down."
131,WILLARD,131,Shot himself. What for ?
132,CHIEF,132,"Beats me -- the sun was too much
for him, or the mud. Who knows ?"
133,WILLARD,133,Arch light.
134,CHEF,134,"I hate that -- Every time I hear
that noise something terrible
happens."
135,CHIEF,135,Anybody see some smoke ?
136,CLEAN,136,Too far inland.
137,LANCE,137,There they are.
138,CLEAN,138,"Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not
till it's too late -- don't have
to hit you neither, concussion'll
do it for a quarter mile or better.
Burst your ears -- suck the air
outta your lungs."
139,WILLARD (V.O.),139,"The dossier on A detachment had
letters from Kurtz' wife and the
wives and families of his men.
All asking where to send future
mail, understanding the necessery
silence due to the nature of
their work -- None of the men had
written home in half a year."
140,WILLARD (V.O.),140,"Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a
dedicated and well-disciplined
spirit. He is a fine officer,
combining military efficiency --
with a broad background in the
Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ..."
141,WILLARD (V.O.),141,"... He views his military career
as the dedication of his talents
to bringing our values and way of
life to those darker, less
fortunate areas in the world."
142,WILLARD (V.O.),142,"... I feel Captain Kurtz' request
for Special Forces training is
highly unusual in regard to his
past humanitarian concerns, and
his somewhat liberal politics,
though I can see no reason to
deny it."
143,WILLARD (V.O.),143,"... We feel Major Kurtz' need to
bring a sense of Western culture
to the backward peoples of these
areas will be of use in
accordance with our 'Vietnamization'
programs ..."
144,WILLARD (V.O.),144,"One day later we came to an
advanced staging area along the
coast. This was our last chance
to pick up supplies before
approaching the mouth of the
Nung River."
145,LANCE,145,Hey.
146,CHIEF,146,"Lance -- I want you to go with the
Captain an' get three extra drums
of fuel and maybe scrounge some
more 50 caliber."
147,LANCE,147,Yeah -- look at those uniforms.
148,CHIEF,148,"Poor bastards, have a long year
to go."
149,SERGEANT,149,"I don't know anything about these
papers, sir."
150,WILLARD,150,"They're in order -- it's perfectly
clean -- just check with ComSec-
Intel like I said."
151,SERGEANT,151,"Well, you know I don't have the
priority to do that, sir. It
says here not to contact Com-Sec-
Int. Who's your commanding
officer ?"
152,WILLARD,152,Right now -- I am.
153,SERGEANT,153,Well who the hell verifies that ?
154,WILLARD,154,I do.
155,CHIEF,155,"No shit -- what's all the activity
for around here ?"
156,SERGEANT,156,The show --
157,WILLARD,157,What show ?
158,SERGEANT,158,"Big show in the parade grounds
this noon -- some boss stuff --"
159,WILLARD,159,This -- Bob Hope or the like --
160,SERGEANT,160,"No sir, I think -- this'll be a
little bit different --"
161,CHIEF,161,Where's it gonna be ?
162,CHEF,162,"It's really too much -- I mean
I've collected every picture of
her since she was Miss December."
163,CLEAN,163,"Yeah -- you can really get hung
up on them like the cat in the
Delta."
164,CHIEF,164,What cat  ?
165,CLEAN,165,"One that went up for murder -- he
was an Army Sergeant."
166,CHIEF,166,I never heard about that.
167,CLEAN,167,"Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy
mag, man -- I mean like he was there
when it arrived -- He just knew."
168,CHEF,168,So what happened ?
169,CLEAN,169,"He was working A.R.V.N. patrols
and had one a them little cocky
gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow,
the Lieutenant took his new Playboy
one day, sat on the end of the dock,
and wouldn't give it back."
170,CHEF,170,Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
171,CLEAN,171,"Then went too far -- he sat
there and starts mutilating the
centerfold. Poking pins in her an'
all that. Sergeant says, don't do
her like that. You leave your
shitty little hands off that girl.
Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in
Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't
do that again. You'll wish you
hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked
his iron to rock and roll and gave
the little zero a long burst
through the Playboy mag. Man, it
blew him clean off the dock --
Hell, just the magazine was floatin'
there all full of holes."
172,CHIEF,172,They nail him for it bad ?
173,CLEAN,173,"He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't
give him no medals or nothing --"
174,AGENT,174,"I'd like to say hello from all of
us up here, to all of you out there.
All of you who've worked so hard
during Operation Brute Force --
Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen
-- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors.
And I want you to know that we feel
proud of you and know how hard your
job is. To prove it -- we've brought
some entertainment we think you're
gonna like: The Playmate of the Year
and her two runners up !"
175,WILLARD (V.O.),175,"Two days out of Hau Fat, there was
nothing but us and the coastline.
I felt like I had set off for
the center of the earth..."
176,CHIEF,176,Smoke !
177,WILLARD,177,Where ?
178,WILLARD,178,Black smoke ... secondary burning.
179,CHIEF,179,"Yeah -- fishing village --
helicopters over there. Hueys,
lots of 'em."
180,WILLARD,180,"First Air Cavalry. They're the
ones gonna get us into the River."
181,KILGORE,181,"Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line
back about a hundred yards -- give
me some room to breathe."
182,KILGORE,182,Bring me some cards.
183,GUARD,183,Sir ?
184,KILGORE,184,"Body cards, you damn fool --
cards !"
185,WILLARD,185,"Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th
Recon Group -- I carry priority
papers from Com-Sec Intelligence
11 Corp -- I believe you understand
the nature of my mission."
186,KILGORE,186,"Yeah -- Na Trang told me to
expect you -- we'll see what we
can do. Just stay out of my way
till this is done, Captain."
187,KILGORE,187,"Six a spades -- eight a hearts --
Isn't one worth a Jack in this
whole place."
188,KILGORE,188,What ? Here. You sure?
189,KILGORE,189,"What's your name, sailor ?"
190,LANCE,190,"Gunner's Mate, Third Class --
L. Johnson, sir."
191,KILGORE,191,Lance Johnson? The surfer?
192,LANCE,192,"That's right, sir."
193,KILGORE,193,"It's an honor to meet you Lance.
I've admired your nose-riding for
years -- I like your cutback, too.
I think you have the best cutback
there is."
194,LANCE,194,"Thank you, sir."
195,KILGORE,195,"You can cut out the sir, Lance --
I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy
foot."
196,KILGORE (O.S.),196,"This is Mike from San Diego and
Johnny from Malibu -- they're good
solid surfers -- none of us are
anywhere near your class, though."
197,WILLARD,197,"My orders are from Com-Sec
Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --"
198,KILGORE,198,"Just hold up a second, Captain --
I'll get to you soon enough --
We've got things to do here."
199,KILGORE,199,"... we do a lot of surfing around
here. Like to finish up operations
early and fly down to Vung Tau for
the evening glass. Have you ever
surfed the point at Vung Tau? I
liked the beach breaks around Na
Trang a lot -- good lefts."
200,KILGORE,200,"... we keep three boards in my
Command Huey at all times. You
never can tell when you're gonna
run into something good. I got a
guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict
a swell two days in advance. We
try to work it in."
201,KILGORE,201,"Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw
one."
202,KILGORE,202,"Where've you been riding, Lance?"
203,LANCE,203,I haven't surfed since I got here.
204,KILGORE,204,"That's terrible -- we'll change
that -- I'd like to see you work --
I've always liked your cutback;
got a hell of a left turn, too."
205,KILGORE,205,"Why the hell you wanna go up
to Nu Mung Ba for?"
206,WILLARD,206,I got bored in Saigon.
207,KILGORE,207,"What's the furthest you been
in?"
208,WILLARD,208,Haiphong.
209,KILGORE,209,"Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?"
210,WILLARD,210,No. Walked.
211,KILGORE,211,What'd you do for supplies?
212,WILLARD,212,"Mercenaries -- agents, traitors --
they put out caches."
213,KILGORE,213,Can you trust them?
214,WILLARD,214,"No. They put out two or three
for every one I needed. When
you get to the one you'll use,
you just stake it out. If
something feels wrong, you just
pass it up. On one mission, I
had to pass up three and ended
up living on rats and chocolate"
215,KILGORE,215,"Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter
Kurtz commanded a Green Beret
detachment at Nu Mung Ba."
216,WILLARD,216,When did you hear?
217,KILGORE,217,"'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz
still alive?"
218,WILLARD,218,Who knows.
219,KILGORE,219,"Seems to me he got himself
fragged. i heard some grunt
rolled a grenade in his tent.
Maybe a rumor. Helluva man --
remarkable officer. Walter
Kurtz woulda been a General
some day. General of the Army.
Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?"
220,WILLARD,220,I met him.
221,KILGORE,221,Don't you agree?
222,WILLARD,222,He musta changed !
223,WILLARD,223,"I got to get into the Nung
River, here or here."
224,KILGORE,224,"That village you're pointing at
is kinda hairy."
225,WILLARD,225,Hairy ?
226,KILGORE,226,"I mean it's hairy -- they got some
pretty heavy ordnance, boy --
I've lost a few recon ships in
there now and again."
227,WILLARD,227,"So? I heard you had a good bunch
of killers here."
228,KILGORE,228,"And I don't intend to get some of
them chewed up just to get your
tub put in the mouth of the
goddman Nung River. You say you
don't know Kurtz?"
229,WILLARD,229,I met him.
230,KILGORE,230,"You talk like him. I don't
mind taking casualties,
Captain, but I like to keep
my ratio ten to one in this
unit -- ten Cong to one."
231,WILLARD,231,You'll find enough Cong up there.
232,KILGORE,232,What about this point here?
233,KILGORE,233,"What's the name of that goddamn
village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook
names all sound the same."
234,KILGORE,234,"Mike, you know anything about
the point at Vin Drip Drop?"
235,MIKE,235,Boss left.
236,KILGORE,236,What do you mean?
237,MIKE,237,"It's really long left slide,
breaks on the short side of the
point -- catches a south swell."
238,LANCE,238,Nice.
239,KILGORE,239,"Why the hell didn't you tell me
about that place -- a good left."
240,KILGORE,240,"There aren't any good left slides
in this whole, shitty country.
It's all goddamn beach break."
241,MIKE,241,"It's hairy ,though. That's
where we lost McDonnel -- they
shot the hell out of us. It's
Charlie's point."

245,LANCE,245,Boss. What's the wind like.
246,MIKE,246,Light off shore -- really hollow.
247,WILLARD,247,"We could go in tomorrow at dawn
-- there's always off-shore wind
in the morning."
248,CHIEF,248,"The draft of that river might be
too shallow on the point."
249,KILGORE,249,"Hell, we'll pick your boat up and
lay it down like a baby, right
where you want it. This is the
Cav boy -- airmobile. I can
take that point and hold it as
long as I like -- and you can
get anywhere you want up that
river that suits you, Captain.
Hell, a six foot left."
250,KILGORE,250,"You take a gunship back to division

him pick out a board, and bring me
my Yater Spoon -- the eight six."

282,WILLARD,282,"Automatic weapons flashes along

millimeter guns and AK-47's."

One time we had a hill bombed

379,LANCE,379,You hear it again?
380,WILLARD,380,"No -- I don't think so. But
it'll be back. They were

383,LANCE,383,Any time -- us -- Americans.
384,WILLARD,384,"I don't think he´d of shot us on

if he saw me taking the board --"
385,LANCE,385,"A Yater spoon is hard to get --
especially here."

389,LANCE,389,"Captain -- that was all true
about the rats and chocolate
and stuff?"
390,WILLARD,390,Sure.
391,LANCE,391,"And you could just tell when
the supplies were booby trapped?"
392,WILLARD,392,"It's a feeling you get in the
jungle. When you get good, you
can find a track and tell not
only how many they are, but
their morale, how far they're
going, whether they're near
their camp, the weapons they're
carrying."
393,CLEAN,393,"How can you tell their weapons..
an' how far they're going?"
394,WILLARD,394,"Mostly from the imprints when they
put them down to rest. their morale
from the way they drag their feet,
or the joints that may be lying
around. If they're near a base
camp, they wouldn't be conserving
food; they'll be throwing it away
half-eaten. If the branches aren't
broken, their weapons are slung.
But all this is just technique..
There's a feeling you get after a
while, that's what's important.
I was going through a village once.
I was looking for a certain party.
I took off my boots, and walked
into each hut. It was midnight.
I went into three like that and
suddenly I realized I´d gone into
each hut the same way -- standing
up -- so the next one I went in on
my belly. An RPD burst took out
the door a bit above my head."
395,WILLARD,395,Things like that.
396,KILGORE (V.O.),396,"I'm not gonna hurt or harm you,
boy -- I just want the board
back -- You can understand --
It was one of my best -- You
know how hard it is to get a
board you like, boy. I'm not
gonna hurt or harm you --
Just leave it where I can find
it --"
397,CLEAN,397,"Jesus -- that guy's too damn
much."
398,CHIEF,398,"I wonder if that was the same
copter."
399,WILLARD,399,"He's probably got 'em all over
the river with that recording.
We better move now while it's
dark."
400,CHIEF,400,"Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take
Lance with you --"
401,WILLARD,401,I'll go with him --

403,WILLARD,403,Chef.
404,CHEF,404,"Yes, sir --"
405,WILLARD,405,Why they call you that?
406,CHEF,406,"Call me what, sir?"
407,WILLARD,407,"Chef -- is that 'cause you like
mangoes an' stuff?"
408,CHEF,408,"No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir

409,WILLARD,409,A sauciere --
410,CHEF,410,"That's right, sir -- I come from
New Orleans -- I was raised to
be a sauciere.. a great sauciere.
We specialize in sauces; my whole
family. It's what we do. I was
supposed to go to Paris and study
at the Escoffier School; I was
saving the money. They called
me for my physical so I figured
the Navy had better food."
411,WILLARD,411,What are you doing out here?
412,CHEF,412,Cook school -- that did it.
413,WILLARD,413,How?
414,CHEF,414,"They lined us all up in front of
a hundred yards of prime rib --
magnificent meat, beautifully
marbled.. Then they started
throwing it in these big
cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.
I looked in, an' it was turning
gray. I couldn't stand it. I

424,CLEAN,424,Was a big tiger -- no shit?
425,WILLARD,425,"Who stopped to measure him -- let's

426,CHEF,426,"A motherfucking tiger -- I could've
been killed."
427,CHIEF,427,"You forgot the mangoes, didn't
you?"
428,CHEF,428,"Mangoes? There as a fucking
tiger in the woods -- I could've
been eaten alive. I'm never
going into that jungle again.
I gotta remember never get out of
the boat; never get outta the boat."
429,WILLARD (V.O.),429,"He was right, the Chef -- never
go into the jungle, unless you're
ready to go all the way."
430,WILLARD (V.O.),430,"What was in the jungle? What was
there, waiting for me?"
431,WILLARD (V.O.),431,"... Kurtz was in there. Or was he;
was it Kurtz? He was just a name
to me now; I couldn't remember a

add up to me. all his liberal
bullshit about the end of savagery

our way of life..."
432,WILLARD (V.O.),432,"Our way of life -- I really

something. I know how you feel
about this, but I had to ask Bob

just couldn't stand it anymore,
not knowing where you are, whether

Walt, I'm sorry I said that. Bob
didn't tell me anything -- he said
he couldn't -- I can't stand it

He wouldn't tell me what the fight

buffaloes -- get off my back."
501,CHIEF,501,"Careful,  Captain, they've been
known to charge."
502,WILLARD,502,"All right I got a little surprise
for you --"
503,WILLARD,503,"I've arranged with those people
we saw at Hau Fat to give us some
50 caliber in trade for a couple
a drums of fuel --"
504,CHEF,504,No shit.
505,WILLARD,505,"Chef -- since you're such a fan
of Miss December's I think you
should be detailed with Lance and
Clean to take the first drum up
there."
506,CHEF,506,I don't believe you --
507,CHIEF,507,"What're you trying to say, Captain --"
508,WILLARD,508,"You'll see soon enough -- get going,
sailor --"
509,CHIEF,509,No shit -- hot damn --
510,CHEF,510,"I've got every one of your
pictures -- I've got the
centerfold -- the Playmate's
review -- the Playmate of the
Year run-off -- everything, even
the calender --"
511,LYNDA,511,"Well, get undressed and let's
get it over with --"
512,CHEF,512,"I can't believe it -- I'd a
never even got to see you if it
wasn't for this war --"
513,CHEF,513,"You wouldn't mind -- uh kinda
draping that jacket over you
sort of the way you were in the
calender, would you?"
514,LYNDA,514,"Come on -- cut this crap -- I
gotta get back to Saigon --"
515,CHEF,515,"Just let me look awhile -- I just
don't believe --"
516,LANCE,516,Well -- uh thanks -- see you around.
517,CATHY,517,Yeah.
518,CATHY,518,Who are you?
519,CLEAN,519,I'm next --
520,WILLARD,520,"Ma'am -- I'd like to thank you for
what you an' all your friends have
done for us -- I want you to know
that me an' the men appreciate
you coming all this way -- riskin'
your lives -- living uncomfortably
an' doing all you can to entertain
us. I want you to know personally,
Miss, that for the past few minutes
you have made me feel at home."
521,WILLARD,521,"Just wanted to say that, ma'am."
522,WILLARD (V.O.),522,"Two days and nights later, we
approach the Do Lung Bridge."
523,SOLDIER,523,"I gotta get out a here -- I´ll pay
-- I got money."
524,CHIEF,524,Get away from this boat.
525,WILLARD,525,"Who's your C.O., soldier?"
526,SOLDIER,526,"Fuck you, you'll get what's coming
to you."
527,LIEUTENANT,527,Captain Willard?
528,WILLARD,528,That's me.
529,LIEUTENANT,529,"Captain Willard -- we got these
from Nha Thrang two days ago --
they expected you here then --"
530,LIEUTENANT,530,"You don't know how happy that makes
me, sir."
531,WILLARD,531,Why?
532,LIEUTENANT,532,"Now I can get out a here -- if
I can find a way out."
533,WILLARD,533,"We'll be needing some supplies
and fuel -- do you know anybody
who can give me a hand?"
534,LIEUTENANT,534,"I'd just clear out as soon as I
could if I were you, sir. They're
gonna start working on the bridge
with torches again. Charlie will
start throwing it in hard --"
535,WILLARD,535,What is this bridge?
536,LIEUTENANT,536,"It's of strategic importance for
keeping the highway into Bat Shan
open -- the generals don't like to
admit that Bat Shan is surrounded."
537,LIEUTENANT,537,"Every night we build it and by
0800 they've blown it up -- it
and a lot of good men -- But the
generals like to say the road is
open -- ha ! Nobody uses that
road except Charlie."
538,LIEUTENANT,538,This is the cesspool of hell.
539,SOLDIER (O.S.),539,Incoming.
540,CHIEF,540,"All right -- Lance, go with the
Captain an' see what you can
scrounge --"
541,CHIEF,541,"Better make it fast, sir -- we
don't really need much anyway."
542,VOICE,542,"Straight ahead, son of a bitch."
543,SOLDIER,543,"You came right to it, son of
a bitch --"
544,WILLARD,544,"Son of a bitch, sir."
545,WILLARD,545,Where's your chief supply officer?
546,SOLDIER,546,Beverly Hills --
547,WILLARD,547,What?
548,SOLDIER,548,"Straight up the road -- a concrete
bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where
else you think he'd be?"
549,WILLARD,549,C'mon --
550,SOLDIER (O.S.),550,"Get your asses down, buddy."
551,VOICE,551,"Watch your feet, asshole --"
552,VOICE,552,You stepped on my face.
553,LANCE,553,We thought you were dead.
554,VOICE,554,The whole world loves a smart ass.
555,WILLARD,555,"What're you shooting at, soldier?"
556,GUNNER,556,Gooks.
557,GUNNER,557,"I´m sorry, sir."
558,WILLARD,558,"It's all right, sergeant -- what's
out there?"
559,GUNNER,559,"They were tryin' to cut through
the wire -- I got 'em all I think."
560,OTHER SOLDIER,560,Oh yeah -- listen.
561,GUNNER,561,"He's trying to call his friends --
send up a flare."
562,SPOTTER,562,"Those are all dead, stupid, he's
obviously underneath 'em --"
563,GUNNER,563,Wake up the Roach.
564,ROACH,564,"Yeah, man."
565,SPOTTER,565,Slope in the wire -- hear him.
566,SPOTTER,566,Bust him.
567,GUNNER,567,Hear him?
568,ROACH,568,"Sure , yeah."
569,GUNNER,569,You need a flare --
570,ROACH,570,"No, it´s cool."
571,ROACH,571,He's close -- real close.
572,ROACH,572,Muhhh Fuhhh ...
573,CHEF,573,"Geez, I wish they'd hurry."
574,SOLDIER,574,"Hey, buddy, that boat still runs,
eh?"
575,CLEAN,575,"Yeah, it still runs."
576,SOLDIER,576,"Do me a favor buddy, please."
577,CLEAN,577,What is it?
578,SOLDIER,578,"Send these out when you get back
to the world."
579,SOLDIER,579,"It's to everyone I really knew --
the first girl I screwed -- my
brother -- best friend -- I wanted
to tell 'em how much I enjoyed
knowing 'em -- it's been a great
twenty years. I gotta let 'em
know."
580,CLEAN,580,"What're you askin' me for -- put
'em in the first helicopter comes
in tomorrow."
581,SOLDIER,581,Nobody comes in here.
582,SOLDIER,582,"The N.V.A. 312th -- over there
the 307th -- on that hill we
counted fourteen different guns
in one minute -- they got rockets
mortars, snipers in those trees,
there's a million of those shitty
little bastards out there -- we're
all gonna die."
583,SOLDIER,583,I'm gonna be dead.
584,SOLDIER,584,"You got a chance in that boat --
by morning you could be five miles
down the river."
585,CLEAN,585,We ain't goin' down the river.
586,CLEAN,586,What's up river from here anyhow --
587,SOLDIER,587,Spooky.
588,CLEAN,588,Charlie?
589,SOLDIER,589,"No, it'd be spooky without the war
-- give 'em back."
590,CHIEF,590,"Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?"
591,WILLARD,591,"We found some bodies -- let's get
out a here."
592,CHIEF,592,I can't see a fucking thing.
593,CHIEF,593,"We hit a big enough one this
hull will shatter like a Corvette.
Fucking plastic boat."
594,WILLARD,594,"What about ducking into one of
those tributaries till this river
slows down?"
595,CHIEF,595,Who knows what's up there?
596,WILLARD,596,"Can't be any worse than this.
What do you think?"
597,CHIEF,597,"I think this river wants to take
us home fast. I'm practically
goin' in reverse."
598,WILLARD,598,"Well, get in there."
599,CHIEF,599,"This whole area is lousy with
V.C. -- We don't stand a chance.
Lemme turn around and we'll be
in Hau Fat in six minutes."
600,WILLARD,600,Get in there !
601,CHIEF,601,"This is my crew and my fucking
boat, and I'm the responsible
party."
602,WILLARD,602,"Get in there now or I'll bury
you in this river."
603,CHIEF,603,"You're fucking crazy. You're
going to get us all killed."
604,LANCE,604,"It breaks through in about
twenty feet."
605,WILLARD,605,What do you see?
606,CHEF,606,I don't know.
607,WILLARD,607,Keep cutting.
608,CHEF,608,"I know it sounds stupid, but I
feel like the goddamn jungle's
watching us."
609,WILLARD,609,Probably is.
610,CHEF,610,Whatdoya think it thinks.
611,WILLARD,611,That we're dumber than we look.
612,CHIEF,612,"Lance -- 'bout twenty meters
starboard."
613,CHEF,613,There in the trees !
614,CHIEF,614,"Elevate Lance, in the tree. No,
I saw another."
615,CHEF,615,"Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw
the fucking flash."
616,CLEAN,616,"I'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a-
bitch, it's jammed, oh God,
it's jammed."
617,WILLARD,617,Throw me that ordnance.
618,WILLARD,618,Give me some kind a field a fire --
619,CHEF,619,We're through.
620,CHEF,620,"Oh, God --"
621,LANCE,621,I ain't finished ! I ain't finished !
622,WILLARD,622,"Bring that bow ordnance into
those trees."
623,CHEF,623,"There's some bad holes, man,
and the cracks -- water's coming
through the cracks. Food's shot
to hell."
624,WILLARD,624,How much is left?
625,CHEF,625,"Less than half -- sure is a
mess down there."
626,WILLARD,626,And the grass?
627,CHEF,627,"Still got a lot of that stuff
from Nha Trang. But we're
running low on the other."
628,WILLARD,628,Hey.
629,WILLARD,629,That's a light down there --
630,CHEF,630,"Yeah, it is."
631,CHIEF,631,What the hell is it?
632,WILLARD,632,"In the middle of the jungle --
a goddamn light."
633,WILLARD,633,Watch it !
634,WILLARD,634,They're not Cong.
635,CHIEF,635,We're Americans.
636,CHEF,636,"Maybe you shouldn't say we're
Americans?"
637,WILLARD,637,"Chef, try your French."
638,CHEF,638,Nous sommes Americains --
639,CHEF,639,Nous ne voulon pas vous agresser.
640,WILLARD (O.S.),640,"French Nationals -- they may not
be too friendly, though."
641,CHEF,641,"Nous sommes Americains -- nous
sommes des amis --"
642,FRENCHMAN,642,"Vous parlez Francais comme une vache
espanole."
643,CHEF,643,"I thought it was pretty good,
myself."
644,CHIEF,644,What'd he say?
645,CHEF,645,"Said I speak French like a
Spanish cow."
646,FRENCHMAN (O.S.),646,Laisser tomber vos armes --
647,CHEF,647,"Put the guns straight up -- stand
away from the mounts."
648,WILLARD,648,Do it.
649,FRENCHMAN (O.S.),649,"Vous pouvez approcher mais
doucement --"
650,CHEF,650,Take her in slow.
651,PHILIPPE,651,Hands on the heads.
652,CHIEF,652,"I can't steer with my goddamn
feet."
653,CHEF,653,"Hey, they speak American."
654,GASTON,654,Who is the commanding officer?
655,CHIEF,655,I --
656,WILLARD,656,"I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard.
This is Chief Warrant Officer
Phillips -- it's his boat. We
were shot up bad downriver and
need repairs and food -- we can
pay you in gold."
657,GASTON,657,Philippe --
658,LANCE,658,I'll help you with --
659,PHILIPPE,659,Do not move --
660,GASTON,660,"Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --"
661,WILLARD,661,"As I said, we can pay you in
gold."
662,GASTON,662,"Entirely unnecessary, Captain."
663,GASTON,663,"We share a common enemy -- you
are our guests."
664,GASTON,664,"I am Gaston de marais -- this is
my family's plantation. It has
been such for 121 years. It will
be such after I die.
This is my son, Philippe -- he
has fought in Algeria and held
the rank of Captain. And Henry
LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was
at Dien Bien Phu. My personal
servant, Tran Van Kac ---"
665,GASTON,665,My youngest son -- Christian --
666,GASTON,666,Christian's wife -- Ann-Marie --
667,GASTON,667,"And my youngest daughter --
Claudine."
668,WILLARD,668,American weapons?
669,GASTON,669,We took them from the dead.
670,GASTON,670,"Now -- I assume you want to rest,
to shower. We'll attend to your
repairs after dinner."
671,CHEF,671,Shower.
672,WILLARD,672,"We don't want to bother you any,
we --"
673,GASTON,673,"A man of war is never bothered to
aid an ally -- you will follow me,
Captain."
674,WILLARD,674,"A habit of men of war, sir --
you understand."
675,GASTON,675,"Of course, Captain -- an
unfortunate necessity."
676,CHIEF,676,What about the boat?
677,PHILIPPE,677,My men will keep it for you --
678,CHIEF,678,"Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the
boat."
679,WILLARD,679,Chief.
680,WILLARD,680,Come with us.
681,GASTON,681,"A suitable accomodation for
your men, captain -- you will,
of course, be quartered with us --"
682,WILLARD,682,Go ahead --
683,GASTON,683,"Captain, this way."
684,GASTON,684,"Magnificent, eh, Captain?"
685,GASTON,685,"It is very good -- there is no
current -- It is very good. I
have never seen one like it in
all Indochina. I was in Paris
when it arrived -- do you know
what might have caused --"
686,WILLARD,686,"Looks like a two thousand pound
to me. Yeah, a two thousand
pound bomb."
687,GASTON,687,"No, I've seen those in Normandy.
This is much better."
688,GASTON,688,"My country -- my country could
never originate this. Magnificent."
689,CHEF,689,"A hot shower, hot damn."
690,WILLARD (V.O.),690,"I wondered -- how long has this room
been like this; how long has the
furniture been standing in these
places?"
691,WILLARD (V.O.),691,"Was it like this sixty years ago?
Eighty years? But here, even
eighty years is nothing."
692,WILLARD (V.O.),692,"It was jungle, once; and it will
be jungle, again..."
693,CHEF,693,"This food is wonderful ! I can't
believe the chef is a slope."
694,CHEF,694,Some more?
695,CHEF,695,Hey -- Lance.
696,LANCE,696,"Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya ..
wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni,
please."
697,GASTON,697,"Roxanne, I hope you are feeling
better."
698,ROXANNE,698,Je vais bien maintenant.
699,GASTON,699,"May I present Captain Willard?
He is of a paratroop regiment.
You know the difference between a
paratrooper and a regular soldier,
don't you , my dear?"
700,ROXANNE,700,"Yes, they come from the sky."
701,WILLARD,701,"I would like to know more about
the .. uh, plaque..."
702,GASTON,702,"Attacks repulsed, as I was saying."
703,GASTON,703,"This is only  for this war, Captain.
Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese
regular forces -- 15; South
Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular
forces and otherwise."
704,GASTON,704,"Americain -- 6. Of course, they
were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain."
705,WILLARD,705,"Of course. I -- Once we make
our repairs, we could send word,
we could have you evacuated
from here."
706,GASTON,706,Captain?
707,WILLARD,707,"You'll get blown outta here some
day."
708,GASTON,708,"We will never 'evacuate', Captain
-- this is our home. Indochina is
ours; it has been so for a hundred
and twenty-one years, there is
something to say for that."
709,WILLARD,709,"The Vietnamese think it's theirs
-- I guess the Americans do,
too."
710,GASTON,710,"But we civilized it. A place
belongs to those who bring light
to it, don't you agree."
711,WILLARD,711,"I always thought the French came
here to get the rubber."
712,PHILIPPE,712,"Excuse me, I must attend to my
men."
713,ROXANNE,713,"May I ask where the Captain is
going in his little boat?"
714,WILLARD,714,"We were going upriver when we
got caught in a storm, ma'am."
715,GASTON,715,"Upriver? Why upriver? There is
nothing there, only jungle."
716,WILLARD,716,Do you know that jungle?
717,GASTON,717,"When I was a boy, my father would
take me there, to hunt. There
are a few savages, but no man
can live there, no white man."
718,WILLARD,718,"What about an American named
Kurtz?"
719,GASTON,719,We have never heard of him.
720,GASTON,720,"Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit,
Captain."
721,WILLARD,721,Good night.
722,ROXANNE,722,"You must realize, Captain -- we
have lost much here -- I, my
husband. Gaston -- his wife and
son."
723,WILLARD,723,I'm sorry to hear that.
724,ROXANNE,724,Cognac?
725,WILLARD,725,"I should be checking on the
boat."
726,ROXANNE,726,"The war will still be here
tomorrow."
727,WILLARD,727,I guess so.
728,ROXANNE,728,"Do you miss your home, Captain?
Have you someone there?"
729,WILLARD,729,"No. Not really.
I was discharged from the army
four years ago. I went home,
wasted some time, bought a Mustang
Mach 1, drove it a week. Then
I re-upped for another tour. No,
everything I love is here."
730,ROXANNE,730,Then you are like us.
731,ROXANNE,731,What will you do after the war?
732,WILLARD,732,"I just follow my footsteps, one
at a time, trying to answer the
little questions and staying away
from the big ones."
733,ROXANNE,733,What's a big question?
734,WILLARD,734,Kurtz.
735,WILLARD,735,I know you've heard of him.
736,ROXANNE,736,Yes.
737,WILLARD,737,What did you hear?
738,ROXANNE,738,"That strange things.. terrible
things have occured around this
American, Kurtz."
739,WILLARD,739,What things?
740,ROXANNE,740,"Gaston would never tell me. It
was asubject not to be spoken of,
Captain."
741,WILLARD,741,Yes.
742,ROXANNE,742,"Did you know -- deeper in the
jungle, upriver -- there are
savages?"
743,WILLARD,743,I know.
744,ROXANNE,744,"But Captain, I mean -- cannibals."
745,ROXANNE,745,"What a pity, you don't drink.
Since my husband died, there
are so many things I must do
alone."
746,ROXANNE,746,"Are you warm, Captain?"
747,WILLARD,747,The river is beautiful.
748,ROXANNE,748,"I spend hours watching that
river from my bedroom window.
It fascinates me."
749,ROXANNE,749,"I have been lonely here, Captain."
750,ROXANNE,750,I will fix you breakfast.
751,WILLARD,751,"I'm afraid I won't have time --
I gotta --"
752,ROXANNE,752,"Whe you reach the boat you will
find that half your fifty calibre
stores -- a case of grenades, a
mortar and two M-16's and a
case of clips are being
transfered to us by your order."
753,WILLARD,753,So that's it.
754,ROXANNE,754,"You may think what you wish,
Captain, but I like you very
much."
755,WILLARD,755,What if I say no.
756,ROXANNE,756,"Then Philippe will have to kill
all of you."
757,GASTON,757,"Two of my men deserted last
night. It happens from time
to time. I assume my daughter
told you of our conditions."
758,WILLARD,758,Your daughter.
759,CHIEF,759,"They taking half our ammo,
Captain -- said it was your orders."
760,WILLARD,760,That's right -- I did.
761,WILLARD,761,"I guess this is whAt men of war
do -- eh?"
762,GASTON,762,"We endure, captain -- you can
blow up the house and we will
live in the cellar -- destroy
that and we'll dig a hole in the
jungle and sleep on it. Burn
the forest and we'll hide in
the swamp. all the while, we
do but one thing -- clean the
blood off our bayonets."
763,GASTON,763,"Au revoir, Captain."
764,CHIEF,764,"Next time we  get in a good fire
fight -- I'd like to know how
she was, Captain."
765,CHEF,765,Holy shit.
766,CLEAN,766,"What did you put in all those
ammo boxes?"
767,WILLARD,767,"Rocks, sand -- those two men
who deserted."
768,CHIEF,768,When'd you do it?
769,WILLARD,769,While you were sleeping.
770,WILLARD (V.O.),770,"We moved deeper and deeper into
the jungle. It was very quiet
there. It was like wandering on
a prehistoric planet, an unknown
world ... where the men thought
they crawled to, I don't know.
For me, we crawled toward Kurtz --
exclusively."
771,CHEF (O.S.),771,Flood.
772,CHIEF (O.S.),772,"No -- most of 'em are still
standing -- might've been
disease."
773,WILLARD (O.S.),773,"I don't know -- there'd still
be some sign -- it's just like
the one this morning."
774,CHIEF,774,"-- All right, Lance --"
775,LANCE,775,The other one --
776,WILLARD,776,No -- leave it --
777,CHIEF,777,Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
778,WILLARD,778,Thta's not Charlie's work --
779,WILLARD,779,"Whoever put'em there didn't do it
to kill people -- They put 'em up
as signs --"
780,CHIEF,780,Signs?
781,WILLARD,781,Yeah -- like keep out --
782,WILLARD (V.O.),782,"Toward the night of the fifth
day out of Do Lung Bridge, we
judged ourselves about eight
miles from Kurtz' base.
Everything was still, the trees,
the creepers, even the brush
seemed like it had been changed
into some kind of stone. It was
unnatural, like a trance. Not
a sound could be heard. I began
to think I was deaf -- then the
fog came suddenly, and I was
blind too."
783,WILLARD,783,Listen.
784,CHIEF,784,What is it?
785,WILLARD,785,Listen.
786,CHIEF,786,"They're on the banks of the
river."
787,LANCE,787,Jesus !
788,CHIEF,788,"No, Lance. Not while you can't
see."
789,CHIEF,789,Will they attack?
790,WILLARD,790,"If they have boats ... or
canoes... they'd get lost in
the fog. We can't move either --
we'll end up on the shore."
791,CHEF,791,God...
792,LANCE,792,Sounds like hundreds of them.
793,WILLARD,793,Shhhhhh.
794,WILLARD,794,"It doesn't sound hostile --
it sounds like they've seen us
coming and it sounds like --
I don't know, a funeral. I
don't understand."
795,WILLARD (V.O.),795,"Two hours after the fog lifted,
we moved slowly to a spot we
thought was roughly a mile and
a half below Kurtz's camp. We
approached a long sand-bank
stretching down the middle of
the river."
796,CHIEF,796,Which way? Right or left?
797,WILLARD,797,Who knows? Right.
798,CHIEF,798,Looks pretty shallow.
799,WILLARD,799,"Upon reaching objective. Target
key personnel and commence
operation. Should difficulty
arise from which extraction is
impossible, break radio silence
Com-Sec Command code Strong Arm --
indicate purgative air strike --
code -- Street Gang."
800,WILLARD,800,"Purgative air strike ! Purgative !
They'd kill me too !"
801,CHIEF,801,"Shit ! Fucking arrows ! They're
shooting fucking arrows at us."
802,WILLARD,802,Steer her right.
803,WILLARD,803,"Keep going.. keep going.
They're just fucking sticks !
Chief, stay at the helm."
804,CHIEF,804,A spear?
805,WILLARD,805,Stop it.
806,LANCE,806,Chief's dead.
807,WILLARD (V.O.),807,"It was the strangest thing --
I don't know that I can explain
it. Two of my men dead, and all
I could think of was whether
Kurtz was dead too. That's all
I wanted: to see Kurtz, to hear
Kurtz."
808,WILLARD (V.O.),808,"Somehow, in the middle of this ...
carnival, Kurtz had grown into
something -- a gifted officer;
a great man.
Somehow, he was the only light
in this hopeless, hopeless
darkness.
And now I was too late --
he was probably gone, disappeared...
by a grenade rolled into his
tent -- or by some spear on the head.
Christ, I felt like howling like
those animals in the fog."
809,WILLARD (V.O.),809,"Here they are in Los Angeles.
Everything is safe. There's a
supermarket around the corner,
the police station around the
other. It would seem ridiculous
to them that I was shot to hell
because I had lost the privilege
of listening to the mysterious
Colonel Kurtz."
810,WILLARD (V.O.),810,"Of course I was wrong. He was
waiting for me. Kurtz was alive
and he was waiting for me."
811,WILLARD,811,"Just stand here with me where
they can see us. Do nothing."
812,WILLARD,812,We've been attacked.
813,AUSTRALIAN,813,"I know, I know, it's all right.
Come in this way. It's mined
over there. This way. It's
all right."
814,CHEF,814,Charlie?
815,WILLARD,815,Looks that way.
816,CHEF,816,Who's he?
817,WILLARD,817,God knows.
818,WILLARD,818,Who the hell are you?
819,AUSTRALIAN,819,Moonby. Got any Winstons?
820,WILLARD,820,Moonby what?
821,AUSTRALIAN,821,"Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal
Australian Regiment, Task Force.
Ex-Corporal Moonby,"
822,the hundreds of natives),822,What
823,MOONBY,823,"Oh, they're simple enough people.
It's good to see you, baby.
Nobody has any Winstons?"
824,MOONBY,824,This boat's a mess.
825,WILLARD,825,"Where's Kurtz? I want to talk
to him."
826,MOONBY,826,"Oh, you don't talk to Colonel
Kurtz."
827,MOONBY,827,You
828,MOONBY,828,"are good. I kept these people
off you, you know. It wasn't
easy."
829,WILLARD,829,Why did they attack us?
830,MOONBY,830,"Simple. They don't want him to
go."
831,WILLARD,831,You're Australian?
832,MOONBY,832,"Pre-Australian, actually. But
I'd dig goin' to California.
I'm California dreamin'."
833,"WILLARD
(almost to himself)",833,So Kurtz is alive.
834,MOONBY,834,"Kurtz. I tell you, that man
has enlarged my mind."
835,MOONBY,835,"But lemme tell you,"
836,MOONBY,836,"most dangerous thing in every
way that I've come on so far.
He wanted to shoot me. The
first thing he said is, 'I'm
going to shoot you because you
are a deserter.' I said I
didn't desert from your army,
I deserted from my army. He
said, 'I'm going to shoot you
just the same.'"
837,WILLARD,837,Why didn't he shoot you?
838,MOONBY,838,"I've asked myself that question.
I said to myself, why didn't he
shoot me? He didn't shoot me,
because I had a stash like you
wouldn't believe. I hid it in
the jungle; the wealth of the
Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish
-- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut
Heroin; the Gold of the Golden
Triangle. and Acid -- I make
Koolaid that makes purple Owsley
come on like piss. Now I'm
Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen
he talks. About everything !
Everything. I forgot there's
such a thing as sleep. Everything.
Of love, too."
839,CHEF,839,Love?
840,MOONBY,840,"Oh, no, not what you think...
Cosmic love. He made me see
things -- things, you know."
841,WILLARD,841,Sounds like he's gone crazy.
842,MOONBY,842,"No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be
crazy -- if you heard him talk,
just last week, you'd never think
he was crazy."
843,WILLARD,843,"Is that where he is? By the
shrunken heads."
844,MOONBY,844,"Those heads, yes. Well, the
rebels..."
845,WILLARD,845,"We're going ashore. Tie her up
-- and leave your guns up, Lance."
846,LANCE,846,What?
847,WILLARD,847,"Bring your rifles, that's all."
848,WILLARD,848,Take us to him.
849,MOONBY,849,"Right on -- he's been waiting
for --"
850,WILLARD,850,And shut up.
851,WILLARD,851,Who are you?
852,MOONBY,852,His name is...
853,WILLARD,853,"I'm not ever goin' to tell you
to shut up again."
854,MAN,854,"Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team...
Special Forces. F-82 -- Col.
Walter Kurtz, commanding."
855,WILLARD,855,What happened here?
856,COLBY,856,What -- happened here.
857,WILLARD,857,Charlie?
858,COLBY,858,"NVA regulars. They're coming
again tonight. Tet -- their
big -- assault."
859,WILLARD,859,I'm taking you back.
860,MOONBY,860,"Oh, no, don´t say that."
861,COLBY,861,"Take us back. Take us back !
But, the operation -- the team.
Colonel Kurtz has such plans for
-- the team."
862,WILLARD,862,"Take me to him, Major."
863,COLBY,863,"I had nothing to do with these
operations -- I did not do the
planning -- none of us did.
It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he
was the genius. You'll see --
the genius of our Colonel. He
should be made a General, don't
you think? A General? It's..."
864,WILLARD,864,"Colonel Kurtz, I guess."
865,KURTZ,865,I'm Kurtz.
866,WILLARD,866,"Captain B.L. Willard reporting
his presence, sir."
867,KURTZ,867,At ease...
868,KURTZ,868,Sit down.
869,KURTZ,869,Why did you come to ... my province.
870,WILLARD,870,"We were attacked -- down river.
We need supplies and medical
help."
871,KURTZ,871,"You were not coming here, to
see me?"
872,"more difficult to go
on with this lie)",872,"No -- no, sir."
873,KURTZ,873,"You came up my river -- in that
small boat. So simple. I
always thought the final justice
would come from the sky, like
we did."
874,KURTZ,874,"You are the final justice,
aren't you?"
875,WILLARD,875,"What do you mean, Colonel?"
876,KURTZ,876,"What other reason could you
have come? A Captain. Ranger.
Paratrooper. Graduate of the
Recondo School. Am I right
about these things?"
877,WILLARD,877,You know you're right.
878,KURTZ,878,"Then the Agency approached you.
Maybe in a bar in Quinon or
Pleiku. Simple. A year's pay
for one life. Perhaps a village
elder, or a tax collector.
Nobody's orders but your own.
Exciting work."
879,KURTZ,879,"You've spent tome at the Royal
Tracking School of Malaysia.
I can tell from the way the
laces on your boots are tied.
I understand you, Captain. We
understand each other."
880,WILLARD,880,Do you know me?
881,KURTZ,881,Yes.
882,"KURTZ
(continuing)",882,Do you know
883,CHEF,883,Holy shit.
884,CHEF,884,"Captain -- they've been probed
all this week -- Cong and NVA
regulars. There's gonna be a
big offense any time."
885,WILLARD,885,I know.
886,CHEF,886,What are we doing here?
887,WILLARD,887,"Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him,
just like he said."
888,KURTZ,888,"Yeah, I can see that. He's
fuckin nuts --"
889,WILLARD,889,Yeah.
890,CHEF,890,"He killed that guy without feeling
anything."
891,WILLARD,891,Not a thing.
892,CHEF,892,"When you kill Cong, don't you
feel something."
893,WILLARD,893,Sure.
894,WILLARD,894,"Recoil... I feel the recoil of
my rifle."
895,WILLARD,895,"This is good -- triple overlapping
fields of fire -- walls so thick
ordinary artillery just cleans
the moss off their surfaces."
896,WILLARD,896,"I've done things, when I was
alone in the jungle -- that I
never told anyone about."
897,CHEF,897,"This is evil -- evil, Captain.
We're all gonna die here."
898,WILLARD,898,"Yeah, I know."
899,CHEF,899,"I don't get it -- You said your
mission was to kill him. Let's
do it, an' get our asses outta
here. This  Kurtz is ruining the
war; I mean, this don't look
good for America !"
900,WILLARD,900,... he's an amazing officer.
901,CHEF,901,"You got to kill this sonuvabitch
-- Lance and me, we don'´t
understand none of this -- Jesus,
Captain -- I don't wanna die here
-- Do it quick."
902,WILLARD,902,Yeah. I know.
903,MOONBY,903,He's asleep -- don't bother him.
904,KURTZ,904,I'm awake.
905,KURTZ,905,You. Get out.
906,KURTZ,906,"I'm going to kill the little
weirdo myself tomorrow."
907,KURTZ,907,"He´s only stayed alive this long
because he's a good orderly and
medic. He knows how to use a
hypodermic."
908,WILLARD,908,"You're gonna get hit tonight,
bad -- a whole regiment of NVA
regulars."
909,KURTZ,909,"That's right, the little gook-
pricks. But they are noble
little gook-pricks, noble.
Because they fight with their
guts, like animals. And for an"
910,KURTZ,910,"with ingenious machines and
fire, like Gods, and for nothing.
But I'll call in a major blotto
airstrike tonight. We'll have
ourselves a helluva airstrike
tonight, a lightshow. How do
you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby
Light My Fire...'"
911,KURTZ,911,Do you?
912,WILLARD,912,"Yeah, I like it..."
913,KURTZ,913,I
914,WILLARD,914,You've gone crazy.
915,KURTZ,915,No. My thinking is clear.
916,KURTZ,916,But my soul has gone mad.
917,KURTZ,917,"My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut !"
918,CHEF,918,"Kill him -- come on, why don't
you kill him"
919,KURTZ,919,Oh shit -- on the table; morphine.
920,KURTZ,920,"You see how stupid it would have
been to blow out my brains? I'm
dying from the gut anyway."
921,KURTZ,921,"No -- I don't want to sleep.
I want to think. Water. Give
me water."
922,WILLARD,922,"You can't have water after
morphine."
923,KURTZ,923,Still playing by the rules.
924,KURTZ,924,You're a damn good kiler.
925,WILLARD,925,How's the pain?
926,KURTZ,926,How's yours?
927,WILLARD,927,I can handle it.
928,KURTZ,928,"Pain is easy to handle -- but
nobility.. the nobility of a
man is judged by how much Truth
he can handle."
929,WILLARD,929,What Truth?
930,KURTZ,930,"The truth that you were sent
here to murder me, ans so far
you haven't done it. And do
you know why?"
931,KURTZ,931,"Yes, you know why."
932,KURTZ,932,"Your mission makes about as much
sense as those idiots who sent
you on it."
933,KURTZ,933,"How long does it take you to
figure out that nobody knows
what they're doing here."
934,KURTZ,934,Except me.
935,KURTZ,935,Gimme water.
936,WILLARD,936,No water.
937,KURTZ,937,You know what you're doing?
938,KURTZ,938,"This water's got Moonby's acid
in it --"
939,KURTZ,939,"Drink it -- drink it for tonight.
Think of it. A whole regiment
of those shitty little Cong --
War. Total war -- war like you've
never known it. It's beautiful
-- you'll love it. Trust me."
940,CHEF,940,"Lance -- the fucker's not gonna
do it."
941,KURTZ,941,"Goddamn -- You've gotta dig
napalm on Speed, too. It's
spectacular, you'll see."
942,KURTZ,942,"Look into the jungle. You can't --
it's too terrible. You have to
smear yourself with warpaint to
look at it -- you have to be a
cannibal."
943,KURTZ,943,"That's why warpaint was invented.
Then it becomes"
944,WILLARD,944,How did we get here?
945,KURTZ,945,"Because of all the things we do,
the thing we do best -- is"
946,WILLARD,946,I think think a lie stinks.
947,KURTZ,947,"Oh Captain, that is so true."
948,WILLARD,948,Stinks. I could never figure --
949,WILLARD,949,"I could never figure how they
can teach boys how to bomb villages
with napalm -- and not let them
write the word 'fuck' on their
airplanes."
950,KURTZ,950,"You could never figure it because
it doesn't make sense."
951,WILLARD,951,Fuck no.
952,KURTZ,952,I'll tell you what makes sense !
953,KURTZ,953,"of them if they don't do what
we want."
954,WILLARD,954,We'll exterminate the fuckers !
955,CHEF,955,Captain -- kill him.
956,KURTZ,956,"Think of it -- for years, millions
of years, savages with pathetic
painted faces were scared shitless
that fire would rain down from
the sky. And goddamn, we made
it happen."
957,CHEF,957,Kill him !
958,LANCE,958,Hot damn !
959,SOLDIER,959,Wow...
960,KURTZ,960,"Mini-gun. Colby. Sergeant.
Mini-gun."
961,WILLARD,961,Napalm.
962,KURTZ,962,"Claymores, claymores."
963,WILLARD,963,"Code -- Street Gang -- Street
Gang ! Purgative air strike;
Street Gang !"
964,KURTZ,964,Charles !
965,KURTZ,965,Go away -- hide yourself.
966,WILLARD,966,What are you doing?
967,KURTZ,967,"Going back  - to the jungle to
die."
968,WILLARD,968,"I'm taking you back. You can
still live."
969,KURTZ,969,I had immense plans.
970,WILLARD,970,I'm gonna get you out of here.
971,KURTZ,971,"I was on threshold of great
things."
972,COLBY,972,Who is he?
973,WILLARD,973,"He was the tragedy -- the tragedy
of this war."
974,KURTZ,974,Don't. Don't frighten them away.
975,WILLARD,975,So you understand this?
976,KURTZ,976,Do I not?
977,KURTZ,977,"My river... my people... my jungle...
my ideas... my country...
my wife..."
978,KURTZ,978,... my death.
979,WILLARD,979,You had immense plans... immense plans...
980,KURTZ,980,Yes...
981,WILLARD,981,I'm taking you back.
982,KURTZ,982,"The horror, the horror."
983,COLBY,983,There.
984,COLBY,984,How did they know?
985,WILLARD,985,They must have seen the fire.
986,COLBY,986,"They're coming to rescue us.
They're Medevac."
987,WILLARD,987,They're coming to take us back.
988,WILLARD,988,Yeah.
989,COLBY,989,"Colonel Kurtz, he's dead."
990,WILLARD,990,Yeah.
991,WILLARD,991,Yeah.
992,WILLARD (V.O.),992,"... Don't remember a lot about my
rehabilitation... but I was sent
back to the world before the fall
of Saigon..."
993,WILLARD,993,"I never answered questions about
Kurtz -- I gave them a few of his
unimportant papers -- but for the
most part I saved everything.
There were other letters, personal
ones written earlier to his wife.
I brought them to het. I watched
the fall of Saigon on television
in a bar in Alameda..."
994,WILLARD,994,Hi.
995,KURTZ'S WIFE,995,"Come in, Captain Willard."
996,KURTZ'S WIFE,996,Can I get anything for you?
997,KURTZ'S WIFE,997,Did you know him very well?
998,WILLARD,998,"You get to know each other pretty
well out there."
999,KURTZ'S WIFE,999,And you admired him?
1000,WILLARD,1000,"He was a remarkable man. It was
impossible not to --"
1001,KURTZ'S WIFE,1001,"Love him... Yes, it is true.
That's the hard part for me... I
knew him better than anyone ... I
knew him best."
1002,WILLARD,1002,You knew him best.
1003,KURTZ'S WIFE,1003,"You were his friend... You must
have been, if he had given you
this..."
1004,KURTZ'S WIFE,1004,"If he sent you to his home. He
was the best this country had --
he was --"
1005,WILLARD,1005,"Yes, I know..."
1006,KURTZ'S WIFE,1006,"I'll never get over it -- But
I'll always remember him..."
1007,WILLARD,1007,Both of us...
1008,KURTZ'S WIFE,1008,Men looked up to him...
1009,KURTZ'S WIFE,1009,He died as he lived...
1010,WILLARD,1010,"His death was -- yes, he died as
he lived."
1011,KURTZ'S WIFE,1011,"Were you with him, when..."
1012,WILLARD,1012,"Yes I was... He said his last
words to me."
1013,KURTZ'S WIFE,1013,What were they?
1014,KURTZ'S WIFE,1014,Tell me.
1015,KURTZ'S WIFE,1015,Tell me what he said.
1016,KURTZ (V.O.),1016,The horror ! The horror !
1017,WILLARD,1017,"He spoke of you, ma'am."
