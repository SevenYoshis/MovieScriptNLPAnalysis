0,ELIZABETH SWANN,0,Will...!
1,ELIZABETH SWANN,1,Why is this happening?
2,WILL TURNER,2,I don't know. You look beautiful.
3,ELIZABETH SWANN,3,"I think it's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding."
4,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,4,"Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been
too long."
5,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,5,His Lord now... actually.
6,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,6,"In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The
warrant for the arrest of one William
Turner."
7,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,7,"Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake.
Arrest her."
8,ELIZABETH SWANN,8,On what charges?
9,WILL TURNER,9,No!
10,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,10,"Ah-ha! Here's the one for William Turner.
And I have another one for a Mister
James Norrington. Is he present?"
11,ELIZABETH SWANN,11,*What are the charges?*
12,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,12,"I don't believe that's the answer to
the question I asked."
13,WILL TURNER,13,"Lord Beckett! In the category of questions
*not* answered..."
14,ELIZABETH SWANN,14,"We are under the jurisdiction of the
King's governor of Port Royal, and you
will tell us what we are charged with."
15,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,15,"For which the punishment, regrettably,
is *also* death. Perhaps you remember
a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow."
16,ELIZABETH SWANN,16,*Captain* Jack Sparrow.
17,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,17,"Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought
you might."
18,GIBBS,18,"Fifteen men on a dead man's chest.
Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Drink
and the devil had done for the rest.
Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
19,JACK SPARROW,19,"Sorry, mate."
20,JACK SPARROW,20,"Mind if we make a little side trip?
I didn't think so."
21,GIBBS,21,Not *quite* according to plan.
22,JACK SPARROW,22,"Complications arose, ensued, were overcome."
23,GIBBS,23,"You got what you went in for, then?"
24,JACK SPARROW,24,Mm-hmm!
25,GIBBS,25,"Captain, I think the crew, meaning me
as well, were expecting something a
bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla
de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed
by the sea, and the treasure with it."
26,LEECH,26,"And the Royal Navy chasing us all around
the Atlantic."
27,MARTY,27,And the hurricane!
28,CREW,28,Aye.
29,GIBBS,29,"All in all, it's seems some time since
we did a speck of honest pirating."
30,JACK SPARROW,30,Shiny?
31,GIBBS,31,"Aye, shiny."
32,JACK SPARROW,32,"Is that how you're all feeling, then?
Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?"
33,COTTON'S PARROT,33,Awk! Walk the plank!
34,JACK SPARROW,34,What did the bird say?
35,LEECH,35,"Do not blame the bird. Show us what
is on that piece of cloth there."
36,JACK SPARROW,36,Ohhh!
37,GIBBS,37,Know that don't do no good.
38,JACK SPARROW,38,It does me.
39,MARTY,39,It's a key!
40,JACK SPARROW,40,"No! Much more better. It is a *drawing*
of a key."
41,JACK SPARROW,41,"Gentlemen, what do keys do?"
42,LEECH,42,Keys... unlock... *things*?
43,GIBBS,43,"And whatever this key unlocks, *inside*
there's something valuable. So, we're
setting out to find whatever this key
unlocks!"
44,JACK SPARROW,44,"No! If we don't have the key, we can't
open whatever it is we don't have that
it unlocks. So what purpose would be
served in finding whatever need be unlocked,
which we don't have, without first having
found the key what unlocks it?"
45,GIBBS,45,So - We're going after this key!
46,JACK SPARROW,46,"You're not making any sense at all.
Any more questions?"
47,MARTY,47,So... Do we have a heading?
48,JACK SPARROW,48,"Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm...
a general... in *that* way - direction."
49,GIBBS,49,Cap'n?
50,JACK SPARROW,50,"Come on, snap to and make sail, you
know how this works. Come on, ?oy/?quick,
?oy/?quick, hey!"
51,MARTY,51,"Have you noticed lately... The captain
seems to be actin' a bit strange...
-er."
52,GIBBS,52,"Settin' sail without knowing his own
headin'? Somethin's got Jack vexed.
Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack
Sparrow bodes ill for us all."
53,GUARD,53,"Lord Beckett. The prisoner as ordered,
Sir."
54,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,54,Those won't be necessary.
55,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,55,"The East India Trading Company has need
of your services.  We wish for you to
act as our agent in a business transaction
with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow."
56,WILL TURNER,56,"More acquaintance than friend. How do
you know him?"
57,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,57,"We've had dealings in the past.  And
we've each left our mark... on the other."
58,WILL TURNER,58,What mark did he leave on you?
59,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,59,"By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set
free. I would like you to go to him,
and recover a certain property in his
possession."
60,WILL TURNER,60,Recover. At the point of a sword?
61,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,61,*Bargain*!
62,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,62,"Letters of Marque. You will offer what
amounts to a full pardon. Jack will
be free, a privateer in the employ of
England."
63,WILL TURNER,63,"Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment
the same as being free."
64,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,64,"Freedom.  Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.
The world is shrinking, the blank pages
of the map filled in. Jack must find
his place in the new world or perish.
Not unlike you, Mister Turner. You and
your fianc√©e face the hangman's noose."
65,WILL TURNER,65,"So you get both Jack *and* the Black
Pearl."
66,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,66,The Black Pearl?
67,WILL TURNER,67,The property you want that he possesses.
68,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,68,"A ship? Hardly. The item in question's
considerably smaller and far more valuable.
Something Sparrow keeps on his person
at all times. A compass.  Ah, you know
it. Bring back that Compass, or there's
no deal."
69,JACK SPARROW,69,Why is the rum always gone?
70,JACK SPARROW,70,Oh! *That's* why.
71,JACK SPARROW,71,"As you were, gents."
72,JACK SPARROW,72,Ah!
73,JACK SPARROW,73,Bootstrap. Bill Turner.
74,JACK SPARROW,74,Is this a dream?
75,JACK SPARROW,75,"I thought not. If it were, there'd be
rum."
76,JACK SPARROW,76,"I had some help retrieving the Pearl,
by the way."
77,JACK SPARROW,77,Your son.
78,JACK SPARROW,78,"And to what do I owe the pleasure of
your carbuncle?"
79,JACK SPARROW,79,Who?
80,JACK SPARROW,80,"Ah. So it's you, then.  He shanghaied
you into service, eh?"
81,JACK SPARROW,81,"It's funny what a man will do to forestall
his final judgment -"
82,JACK SPARROW,82,Technic -
83,JACK SPARROW,83,"Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already
*has* a captain, so there's re -"
84,JACK SPARROW,84,"Any idea when Jones might release said
terrible beastie?"
85,JACK SPARROW,85,"On deck all hands! Make fast the bunt
gasket! On deck! Scurry! ?Scurry-on/?Marty,
I want movement!"
86,JACK SPARROW,86,*I want movement!*
87,GIBBS,87,Lift the skin up!
88,JACK SPARROW,88,"All on deck! Run! And keep running!
Run as if the devil himself and itself
is upon us!"
89,GIBBS,89,Do we have a heading?
90,JACK SPARROW,90,Ah! Ooh! Run! Land.
91,JACK SPARROW,91,Oh! Euh!
92,GIBBS,92,Which port?
93,JACK SPARROW,93,Didn't say port. I said land. Any land.
94,JACK SPARROW,94,Agh!
95,GIBBS,95,Jack's hat! Bring 'er about!
96,JACK SPARROW,96,No no! Leave it! Run!
97,GIBBS,97,Back to your stations! The lot o' ya!
98,GIBBS,98,Jack?
99,JACK SPARROW,99,Shhh!
100,GIBBS,100,"For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what's coming after us?"
101,JACK SPARROW,101,Nothing.
102,TURKISH FISHERMAN,102,"Heh-heh-heh.?tupayHey! ?Fo

106,GREEK FISHERMAN,106,kapitan ###
107,CARRUTHERS,107,Here now. He can't be here.
108,CARRUTHERS,108,"Mister Swann, -"
109,ELIZABETH SWANN,109,"Jack's Compass. What does Beckett want
with that?"
110,WILL TURNER,110,"Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and
convince him to return to Port Royal.
In exchange the charges against us will
be dropped."
111,WILL TURNER,111,"Is that lack of faith in Jack, or in
me?"
112,ELIZABETH SWANN,112,"I have faith in you. Both of you. Where
will you find him?"
113,WILL TURNER,113,"Tortuga. I'll start there, and I won't
stop searching 'til I find him. And
then I intend to return here, to marry
you."
114,ELIZABETH SWANN,114,Properly?
115,WILL TURNER,115,"Eagerly, if you'll still have me."
116,ELIZABETH SWANN,116,"If it weren't for these bars I'd have
you already."
117,ELIZABETH SWANN,117,I'll wait for you.
118,WILL TURNER,118,Keep a weather eye on the horizon.
119,WEATHERED SAILOR,119,"*Captain* Jack Sparrow? Owes me four
dubloons. Heard he was dead."
120,HALF-BLIND FISHERMAN,120,"Singapore. That's what I heard. Drunk
with a smile on his face. Sure as the
tide, Jack Sparrow... will turn up in
Singapore."
121,GISELLE,121,Jack Sparrow!
122,SCARLETT,122,I haven't seen 'im in a month.
123,GISELLE,123,"When you find him, will you give him
a message?"
124,SHRIMPER,124,"Cannot say about Jack Sparrow. But dere's
a island, just south of de straits,
where I trade spice for... mmm... delicious
long pork. Cannot say about Jack. But
you find a ship dere. A ship wit' black
sails."
125,CANNIBAL ISLAND,125,beach
126,SHRIMPER,126,My brother will take you ashore.
127,WILL TURNER,127,What's wrong? The beach is right there.
128,SHRIMPER'S BROTHER,128,"?: Ne bougeais pas, c'est trop dangereux."
129,WILL TURNER,129,What?
130,SHRIMPER'S BROTHER,130,"?: Je ne peux, c'est trop dangereux,
j'avais le dit. Bon voyage, monsieur."
131,WILL TURNER,131,Jack! Jack Sparrow!
132,WILL TURNER,132,Marty! Cotton! Anybody?
133,COTTON'S PARROT,133,Awk!
134,WILL TURNER,134,Ah! A familiar face!
135,COTTON'S PARROT,135,Rawk! Don't eat me!
136,WILL TURNER,136,I'm not gonna eat you.
137,COTTON'S PARROT,137,Don't eat me! No! Don't eat me! Akkk!
138,WILL TURNER,138,Gibbs.
139,WILL TURNER,139,"Euh! Unh! Ya! Come on! Let's go! Euh!
Ya! Come on! Who wants it? Unh! I could
do this all day! Euh! Euh! Hah!"

141,CANNIBAL ISLAND,141,Hurry-hurry tan daga!
142,WILL TURNER,142,"Jack? Jack Sparrow! I can honestly say
I'm glad to see you!"
143,WILL TURNER,143,Jack! It's me! Will Turner!
144,JACK SPARROW,144,"?: Wa-say kohn.
Een dah-lah. Eeseepi."
145,CANNIBAL CROWD,145,Eeseepi.
146,WILL TURNER,146,Tell 'em to let me down.
147,JACK SPARROW,147,"Kay-lay lam. Lam piki-piki. Lam eensy
weensy. Lam say-say... eunuchy. Snip-snip."
148,CANNIBAL CROWD,148,Ahhh... eunuchy!
149,WILL TURNER,149,"Jack! The Compass! That's all I need,
Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested
for trying to help *you*. She faces
the gallows!"
150,JACK SPARROW,150,"Say-say lam shoop-shoop sha smalay-lama

153,JACK SPARROW,153,Save me!
154,WILL TURNER,154,"Jack, what did you tell them? No! What
about Elizabeth? *Jack...!*"
155,PRISONERS,155,"...we don't bite...Come on...
] Prisoners: Where you goin'...?)"
156,ELIZABETH SWANN,156,Why don't you tell me what's happening?
157,ELIZABETH SWANN,157,No! Will has gone to find Jack!
158,ELIZABETH SWANN,158,"He's a better man than you give him
credit for."
159,ELIZABETH SWANN,159,A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
160,MERCER,160,"Evening, Governor.  Shame, huh? He was
carryin' this. It's a letter to the
King. It's from *you*."
161,MERCER,161,Where is she?
162,PORT ROYAL,162,EITC headquarters
163,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,163,"No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,
as your father believes."
164,ELIZABETH SWANN,164,Then what is?
165,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,165,"I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency
of the realm."
166,ELIZABETH SWANN,166,"I expect then that we can come to some
sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate."
167,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,167,I'm listening.
168,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,168,I'm listening *intently*.
169,ELIZABETH SWANN,169,"These Letters of Marque, they are signed
by the King?"
170,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,170,"Yes, and they're not valid until they
bear my signature and my seal."
171,ELIZABETH SWANN,171,"Or else I would not still be here. You
sent Will to get you the Compass owned
by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good."
172,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,172,Do explain.
173,ELIZABETH SWANN,173,"I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have
seen the treasure myself. There is something
you need to know."
174,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,174,"Ah, I see. *You* think the Compass leads
only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you
hope to *save* me from an evil fate.
But you mustn't worry. I care not for
cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not
so provincial. There's more than one
chest of value in these waters. So perhaps
you may wish to enhance your offer."
175,ELIZABETH SWANN,175,"Consider into your calculations that
you robbed me of my wedding night."
176,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,176,"So I did. A marriage interrupted.  Or
fate intervenes. You make great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom."
177,ELIZABETH SWANN,177,These aren't going to Jack.
178,LORD CUTLER BECKETT,178,"Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's
freedom, then? I'll still want that
Compass. Consider that in your calculations."
179,RAGETTI,179,"Well I say it was divine providence
what escaped us from jail."
180,PINTEL,180,"And I say... it was me bein' *clever*.
Ain't that right, poochie?"
181,RAGETTI,181,"?: Well how'dya know it ?weren't/?wasn't
divine providence what inspired you
to *be* clever? Anyways, I ain't stealin'
no ship."
182,PINTEL,182,"It ain't stealin'. It's *salvagin'*!
And since when did you care?"
183,RAGETTI,183,"Since we're not immortal no more. We
gotta take care of our immortal souls."
184,PINTEL,184,You know you can't read.
185,RAGETTI,185,It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.
186,PINTEL,186,"Pretendin' to read the Bible's a *lie*!
*That's* a mark against ya!  Look! There
it is!"
187,RAGETTI,187,What's got into *'im*?
188,PINTEL,188,Must've seen a catfish. Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.
189,RAGETTI,189,Stupid mongrel!

191,PINTEL,191,Come on! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha...
192,PINTEL,192,It's ours for the taking!
193,RAGETTI,193,"Tide's comin', that should help. Well,
salvagin' is saving, in a manner of
speaking."
194,PINTEL,194,There's the truth of *it*! ###
195,RAGETTI,195,"Suppose we be'er... save it as soon
as we can. What with our souls in such
a vulnerable state, and all."
196,PINTEL,196,Amen to that.

200,WILL TURNER,200,"Why would he do this to us? If Jack
is their chief."
201,GIBBS,201,"Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their
chief. But he only remains chief as
long as he *acts* like a chief."
202,WILL TURNER,202,"So he had no choice. He's a captive
then as much as the rest of us."
203,GIBBS,203,"Worse... as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a *god* in human
form, and they intend to do him the
honor of releasing him from his fleshy
prison."
204,GIBBS,204,?Argh! They'll roast him and eat him.
205,WILL TURNER,205,Where's the rest of the crew?
206,GIBBS,206,"These cages we're in... weren't built
'til *after* we got here."
207,GIBBS,207,"The feast is about to begin. Jack's
life will end... when the drums stop."

258,GIBBS,258,"Let's put some distance between us and
this island, and head out to open sea."
259,JACK SPARROW,259,"Yes to the first, yes to the second,
but only insofar as we keep to the shallows
as much as possible."
260,GIBBS,260,"Uh, that seems a bit contradictory,
Captain."
261,JACK SPARROW,261,"I have every faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills, Master Gibbs, now
where is that monkey? I want to shoot
*something*."
262,WILL TURNER,262,Jack.
263,JACK SPARROW,263,Ah.
264,WILL TURNER,264,Elizabeth is in danger.
265,JACK SPARROW,265,"Have you considered keeping a more watchful
eye on 'er? Maybe just lock her up somewhere."
266,WILL TURNER,266,"She *is* locked up, in a prison, bound
to hang for helping *you*!"
267,JACK SPARROW,267,"There comes a time when one must take
responsibility for one's mistakes."
268,WILL TURNER,268,"I need that Compass of yours, Jack.
I must trade it for her freedom."
269,JACK SPARROW,269,Mister Gibbs!
270,GIBBS,270,Cap'n.
271,JACK SPARROW,271,We have a need to travel upriver.
272,GIBBS,272,"By need, d'you mean a... trifling need,
?uh/?a... fleeting, as in say in a passing
fancy?"
273,JACK SPARROW,273,"No, a... resolute and unyielding need."
274,WILL TURNER,274,"What we need to do is make sail for
Port Royal with all haste."
275,JACK SPARROW,275,"William... I shall trade you the Compass,
if you will help me... to find *this*."
276,WILL TURNER,276,You want me to find this?
277,JACK SPARROW,277,"No. *You* want you to find this. Because
the finding this finds you incapacitorially
finding and/or locating and your discovering
the detecting of a way to save your
?dolly/?dotty belle ol'... what's-her-face.
Savvy?"
278,WILL TURNER,278,This... is going to save Elizabeth?
279,JACK SPARROW,279,How much do you know about Davy Jones?
280,WILL TURNER,280,Not much.
281,JACK SPARROW,281,"Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth."
282,BELLAMY,282,"What's all this? If you both fancy the
dress, you'll just have to share, and
wear it one after the other."
283,BURSAR,283,"It's not like that, Sir. This ship is
haunted."
284,BELLAMY,284,Is it now? 'N' you?
285,QUARTERMASTER,285,"The... female presence... amongst us,
yes... all the men... they can feel
it."
286,BURSAR,286,"I say... that we throw the dress overboard,
and we hope the spirit finds it."
287,QUARTERMASTER,287,"No! That - that will just anger the
spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find
out what the spirit needs, and then
just get it back!"
288,BELLAMY,288,"Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious
goats and it's got the best of you.
Now this appears to be no more as we
have a stowaway aboard. A young woman,
by the look of it. I want you to search
the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh...
she's probably naked."
289,WILL TURNER,289,Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
290,GIBBS,290,"Well, if you believe such things, there's
a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones.
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that suction your face clean off. And
drag an entire ship past the crushing
darkness. The Kraken!"
291,GIBBS,291,"They say the stench of its breath is
like - ooh! Imagine: The last thing
you know on God's green earth is the
roar of the Kraken, and the reeking
odor of a thousand rotting corpses.
If you believe such things."
292,WILL TURNER,292,And the key will spare him that?
293,GIBBS,293,"Now that's the very question Jack wants
answered. Bad enough even to go visit...
*Her*."
294,WILL TURNER,294,Her?
295,GIBBS,295,Aye.
296,BAYOU,296,Tia's shack
297,JACK SPARROW,297,"No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go
way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable
we are. Were. Have been. Before."
298,GIBBS,298,I'll watch your back.
299,JACK SPARROW,299,"It's me front I'm worried about. Mind
the boat."
300,GIBBS,300,Mind the boat.
301,?WILL TURNER,301,Mind the boat.
302,PINTEL,302,Mind the boat.
303,MARTY,303,Mind the boat.
304,COTTON'S PARROT,304,Awk! Mind the boat!
305,TIA DALMA,305,Jack Sparrow!
306,JACK SPARROW,306,Tia Dalma!
307,TIA DALMA,307,"I always know de wind was goin' blow
you back to me one day."
308,TIA DALMA,308,"You. You have a touch of... destiny
about *you*, William Turner."
309,WILL TURNER,309,You know me?
310,TIA DALMA,310,You want to know *me*.
311,JACK SPARROW,311,"There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without
it."
312,JACK SPARROW,312,I thought *I* knew you.
313,TIA DALMA,313,Not so well as I had hoped. Come.
314,JACK SPARROW,314,Come.
315,TIA DALMA,315,"What... service... may I do you? Hmmm?
You know I demand payment."
316,JACK SPARROW,316,I brought payment.
317,JACK SPARROW,317,Look!
318,JACK SPARROW,318,An undead monkey! Top that!
319,GIBBS,319,"No! You've no idea how long it took
us to catch that."
320,TIA DALMA,320,The payment is fair.
321,JACK SPARROW,321,"We're looking for this.  And what it
goes to."
322,TIA DALMA,322,"The Compass you bartered from me. It
cannot lead you to dis?"
323,JACK SPARROW,323,Maybe. Why?
324,TIA DALMA,324,"Ayeee... Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants! Or... do know, but are
loathe to claim it as your own. Your
key go to a chest, and it is what lay
inside the chest you seek, don't it?"
325,GIBBS,325,What *is* inside?
326,PINTEL,326,"Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of
a valuable nature?"
327,RAGETTI,327,"Nothing... bad, I hope."
328,TIA DALMA,328,"You know of... Davy Jones, yes? A man
of de sea. A great sailor, until he
ran afoul of dat which vex all men."
329,WILL TURNER,329,What vexes all men?
330,TIA DALMA,330,"What, indeed."
331,GIBBS,331,The sea?
332,PINTEL,332,Sums!
333,RAGETTI,333,Dichotomy of good and evil.
334,JACK SPARROW,334,A *woman*.
335,TIA DALMA,335,A wo-*man*. He fell in love.
336,GIBBS,336,"No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea*
he fell in love with."
337,TIA DALMA,337,"Same story, different versions, and
all are true. See, it was a *woman*,
as changing, and harsh, and untamable
as the sea. Him never stopped loving
her. But the pain it cause 'im was too
much to live wid. But not enough to
cause him to die."
338,WILL TURNER,338,"What... exactly did he put into the
chest?"
339,TIA DALMA,339,Him heart.
340,RAGETTI,340,"Literally, or figuratively?"
341,PINTEL,341,"He couldn't li'erally put his heart
in a chest!  Could he?"
342,TIA DALMA,342,"It was not wort' feeling what... small
fleeting joy life brings, and so...
he carved out him heart, lock it away
in a chest, and hide de chest from de
world. De keys, he keep wid him at all
times."
343,WILL TURNER,343,You knew this.
344,JACK SPARROW,344,"I did not. I didn't know where the key
was. But now we do. So all that's left
is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman,
grab the key, you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, hey!"
345,TIA DALMA,345,Let me see your hand.
346,GIBBS,346,Uhhh! The black spot!
347,JACK SPARROW,347,"My eyesight's as good as ever, just
so you know."
348,TIA DALMA,348,"I am justMy little ###, where
are you? ###"
349,TIA DALMA,349,"Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot
step on land but once every ten years.
Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow.
And so you will carry land wid you..."
350,JACK SPARROW,350,Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.
351,TIA DALMA,351,Yes?
352,JACK SPARROW,352,Is the... jar of dirt going to help?
353,TIA DALMA,353,"If you don' want it, give it back."
354,JACK SPARROW,354,No.
355,TIA DALMA,355,Den it helps.
356,WILL TURNER,356,"It seems... we have a need to find the
Flying Dutchman."
357,TIA DALMA,357,A touch... of destiny!
358,WILL TURNER,358,"That's the Flying Dutchman? She doesn't
look like much."
359,JACK SPARROW,359,"Neither do you. Do *not* underestimate
her."
360,GIBBS,360,Must've run afoul of the reef.
361,JACK SPARROW,361,"So what's your plan, then?"
362,WILL TURNER,362,"I row over, search the ship until I
find your bloody key."
363,JACK SPARROW,363,And if there are crewmen?
364,WILL TURNER,364,I cut down anyone in my path.
365,JACK SPARROW,365,"I like it. Simple, easy to remember."
366,RAGETTI,366,"Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha, ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha!"
367,JACK SPARROW,367,"Hey! If you *do* happen to get captured,
just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle
his debt! Might save your life!"
368,RAGETTI,368,Bon voyage! Ha-ha-ha!
369,JACK SPARROW,369,Douse the lamps.

376,WILL TURNER,376,There's no use. You've run aground.
377,WOUNDED SAILOR,377,No! Beneath us! Foul breath!
378,WILL TURNER,378,Hey! Hey!

382,MACCUS,382,"Five men still alive. The rest have
moved on."
383,DAVY JONES,383,"Do you fear death?  Do you fear that
dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare.
All your sins punished.  I can offer
you... an escape-uh."
384,CHAPLAIN,384,Don't listen to him!
385,DAVY JONES,385,Do you not fear death?
386,CHAPLAIN,386,"I'll take my chances, Sir."
387,DAVY JONES,387,To the depths.
388,DAVY JONES,388,"Life is cruel.  Why should the afterlife
be any *different*? I offer you a choice.
Join my crew, and postpone the judgment.
One hundred years before the mast. Will
ye serve?"
389,HELMSMAN,389,"I - I will, serve."
390,DAVY JONES,390,?Grand.
391,DAVY JONES,391,"*You* are neither dead nor dying. What
is your purpose here?"
392,WILL TURNER,392,"Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his
debt."
393,DAVY JONES,393,What is your purpose here?
394,WILL TURNER,394,"Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his
debt."
395,DAVY JONES,395,"Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted
to accept that offer."
396,JACK SPARROW,396,Oh.
397,DAVY JONES,397,"You have a debt to pay. You've been
captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen
years. *That* was our agreement."
398,JACK SPARROW,398,"Technically, I was only captain for
two years, then I was viciously mutinied
upon."
399,DAVY JONES,399,"Then you were a poor captain, but a
*captain* nonetheless! Have you not
introduced yourself all these years
as *Captain* Jack Sparrow?"
400,JACK SPARROW,400,"You have my payment. One soul to serve
on your ship is already over there."
401,DAVY JONES,401,One soul is not equal to another.
402,JACK SPARROW,402,"Aha! So we've established my proposal
is sound in principle, now we're just
haggling over price."
403,DAVY JONES,403,Price? Pttt!
404,JACK SPARROW,404,"Just how many souls do you think my
soul is worth?"
405,DAVY JONES,405,"One hundred souls, three days-uh."
406,JACK SPARROW,406,"You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy, I'll get started right off."
407,DAVY JONES,407,"I keep the boy. A good-faith payment.
That leaves you only ninety-nine more
to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!"
408,JACK SPARROW,408,"Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble,
heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at
least four... maybe three and a half.
And did I happen to mention... he's
in love. With a girl. Due to be married.
Betrothed.  Dividing him from her and
her from him... would only be half as
cruel as actually allowing them be joined
in holy matrimony. Aye?"
409,DAVY JONES,409,"I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh.
But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live
with this? Can you condemn an innocent
man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of
servitude, in your name while you roam
free?"
410,JACK SPARROW,410,"Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal
it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?"
411,JACK SPARROW,411,Uh!
412,DAVY JONES,412,Three days.  Three days.
413,JACK SPARROW,413,"Oh, Mr. Gibbs."
414,GIBBS,414,Aye.
415,JACK SPARROW,415,"Uh, I feel sullied and unusual."
416,GIBBS,416,"And how do you intend to harvest these
ninety-nine souls in three days?"
417,JACK SPARROW,417,"Fortunately, he was mum as the condition
in which these souls need be."
418,GIBBS,418,Ah... Tortuga!
419,JACK SPARROW,419,Tortuga.
420,BELLAMY,420,"It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing
fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help
us, pilotage. Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?"
421,QUARTERMASTER,421,"I'm afraid, Sir... Tortuga is the only
free port left in these waters."
422,BELLAMY,422,"A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well,
I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what
I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep
well each night, thank you."
423,BURSAR,423,S-S-Sir!
424,BURSAR,424,She wants you to... do something.
425,BELLAMY,425,She's tryna give a sign.
426,BELLAMY,426,Over there! Look for a sign!
427,QUARTERMASTER,427,"Look there! There it is. There's the
sign."
428,?BURSAR,428,That's seaweed.
429,QUARTERMASTER,429,S-Seaweed can be a sign.
430,?BURSAR,430,Looks like entrails.
431,ELIZABETH SWANN,431,What's that over there?
432,GIBBS,432,"And what makes you think you're worthy
to crew the Black Pearl?"
433,ELDERLY MAN,433,"Truth be told, I never sailed a day
in me life. I figure I should get out
and see the world while I'm still young."
434,GIBBS,434,You'll do. Make your mark. Next!
435,JILTED MAN,435,"My wife ran off with my dog. And I'm
drunk for a month. And I don't give
a ass rat's if I live or die."
436,GIBBS,436,Perfect! Next!
437,ONE-ARMED MAN,437,"Me have one arm, 'n' a bum leg."
438,GIBBS,438,It's the crow's nest for you.
439,JACK SPARROW,439,I know what I want.
440,GIBBS,440,Next!
441,ROMANTIC MAN,441,"Ever since I was a little lad, I've
always wanted to sail the seas. Forever."
442,GIBBS,442,Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.
443,ROMANTIC MAN,443,Thanks very much.
444,JACK SPARROW,444,How we going?
445,GIBBS,445,"Including those four? That gives us
- four!"
446,GIBBS,446,And what's *your* story?
447,NORRINGTON,447,"My story... it's exactly the same as
your story, just one chapter behind.
I chased a man across the Seven Seas.
The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission,
and my life."
448,GIBBS,448,Commodore?
449,NORRINGTON,449,"No, not anymore, weren't you *listening*?
I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I
would have, if not for the... hurricane."
450,GIBBS,450,"Lord. You didn't try to sail through
it?"
451,NORRINGTON,451,"So do I make your crew, or not? You
haven't said where you're going. Somewhere
*nice*!"
452,NORRINGTON,452,"So am I *worthy* to serve under Captain
Jack Sparrow?"
453,NORRINGTON,453,Or should I just kill you now?
454,JACK SPARROW,454,You're hired.
455,NORRINGTON,455,Sorry. Old habits and all that.
456,JACK SPARROW,456,Time to go?
457,GIBBS,457,Aye!
458,JACK SPARROW,458,"Thanks, mate."
459,JACK SPARROW,459,Carry on.
460,NORRINGTON,460,"Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an
orderly line, I'll have you all one
by one. Come on, who's first?"
461,ELIZABETH SWANN,461,"I just wanted the pleasure of doing
that myself!"
462,ELIZABETH SWANN,462,"James Norrington.  What has the world
done to you?"
463,BO'SUN,463,"Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner!"
464,BO'SUN,464,Step ?to-it/?tight!
465,WILL TURNER,465,Step aside!
466,BO'SUN,466,?Regain-?yourselves!/?Mind-?yourself!
467,BO'SUN,467,Haul that weevil to his feet!
468,BO'SUN,468,"Five lashes to remind you... to stay
on 'em!"
469,BO'SUN,469,"Impeding me in my duties. You'll share
the punishment."
470,DAVY JONES,470,"Will you now? And what would prompt
such an act of charity?"
471,DAVY JONES,471,"Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous
circumstance be this! Five lashes be
owed. I believe it is."
472,DAVY JONES,472,"The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner.
Your issue will feel its sting be it
the Bo'sun's hand, by your own."
473,DAVY JONES,473,Bo'sun!
474,BO'SUN,474,"You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha!"
475,WILL TURNER,475,I don't need your help!
476,WILL TURNER,476,"So I'm to understand what *you* did
was an act of compassion?"
477,FLYING DUTCHMAN,477,below deck
478,WILL TURNER,478,I've sworn no oath.
479,WILL TURNER,479,Not until I find this. The key.
480,WYVERN,480,The deadman's chest.
481,WILL TURNER,481,What do you know of this?
482,WYVERN,482,"Open the chest with the key, and stab
the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the
heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart,
or there'll be no captain. And if there's
no captain, there's no one to have the
key."
483,WILL TURNER,483,So the captain has the key.
484,WILL TURNER,484,Where *is* the key?
485,WYVERN,485,Hidden.
486,WILL TURNER,486,Where is the chest?
487,WYVERN,487,Hidden.
488,ELIZABETH SWANN,488,Captain Sparrow!
489,JACK SPARROW,489,"Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard."
490,ELIZABETH SWANN,490,I'm here to find the man I love.
491,JACK SPARROW,491,"I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first
and only love is the sea."
492,ELIZABETH SWANN,492,"Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow."
493,JACK SPARROW,493,Elizabeth.  Hide the rum.
494,JACK SPARROW,494,"You know, these clothes do not flatter
you at all. It should be a dress or
nothing. I happen to have no dress in
my cabin."
495,ELIZABETH SWANN,495,"Jack. I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?"
496,JACK SPARROW,496,"Darling, I am truly unhappy to have
to tell you this but... through an unfortunate
and *entirely* unforeseeable series
of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever
to do with me, poor William has been
press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew."
497,ELIZABETH SWANN,497,Davy Jones?
498,NORRINGTON,498,"Oh, please. The captain of the Flying
Dutchman."
499,JACK SPARROW,499,"You look bloody awful. What are you
doing here?"
500,NORRINGTON,500,"You *hired* me. I can't help it if your
standards are lax."
501,JACK SPARROW,501,You *smell* funny.
502,ELIZABETH SWANN,502,Jack. All I want is to find Will.
503,JACK SPARROW,503,"Are you certain? Is that what you really
want most?"
504,ELIZABETH SWANN,504,'Course.
505,JACK SPARROW,505,"Because I would think, you'd want to
find a way to *save* Will the most."
506,ELIZABETH SWANN,506,And you have a way of doing that?
507,JACK SPARROW,507,"Well, there is a chest..."
508,NORRINGTON,508,"Oh, dear."
509,JACK SPARROW,509,A chest of unknown size and origin.
510,PINTEL,510,"What contains the still-beating heart
o' Davy Jones."
511,RAGETTI,511,Unh-unh... unh-unh... unh-unh...
512,JACK SPARROW,512,"And whoever possesses that chest possesses
the leverage to command Jones to do
whatever it is he or she wants, including...
saving brave William from his grim fate."
513,NORRINGTON,513,"You don't actually believe him, do you?"
514,ELIZABETH SWANN,514,How do we find it?
515,JACK SPARROW,515,With this. My Compass... is unique.
516,NORRINGTON,516,"""Unique"" here having the meaning of
broken."
517,JACK SPARROW,517,"True enough. This Compass does not point
north."
518,ELIZABETH SWANN,518,Where does it point?
519,JACK SPARROW,519,"It points to the thing you want most
in this world."
520,ELIZABETH SWANN,520,Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth?
521,JACK SPARROW,521,"Every word, love. And what you want
most in this world is to find the chest
of Davy Jones, is it not?"
522,ELIZABETH SWANN,522,To save Will?
523,JACK SPARROW,523,By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
524,JACK SPARROW,524,Mister Gibbs!
525,GIBBS,525,Cap'n.
526,JACK SPARROW,526,We have our heading.

you'd be interested in the whereabouts
of your daughter."

by cannonade and cutlass,  and all manner

543,WILL TURNER,543,"It's a game of deception. Your bet includes
all the dice, not just your own."
544,WILL TURNER,544,What are they wagering?
545,WILL TURNER,545,So any crewman can be challenged?
546,WILL TURNER,546,I challenge Davy Jones.
547,DAVY JONES,547,I accept ?that-uh.
548,DAVY JONES,548,The stakes?
549,WILL TURNER,549,My soul. An eternity of servitude.
550,DAVY JONES,550,Against?
551,WILL TURNER,551,I want this.
552,DAVY JONES,552,How do you know of the key?
553,WILL TURNER,553,"That's not part of the game, is it?
You can still walk away."

Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you
will spend an eternity on this ship!
Master Turner, feel free to go ashore...
the very next time we make port!"

a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And
not rest until this blade pierces his
heart. I will not abandon you. I promise."

of the East India Trading Company."

572,GIBBS,572,"Will was working for Beckett, and never
said a word."
573,JACK SPARROW,573,Agh.
574,GIBBS,574,"Beckett wants the Compass. Only one
reason for that."
575,JACK SPARROW,575,Of course. He wants the chest.
576,ELIZABETH SWANN,576,"Yes, he did say something about a chest."
577,GIBBS,577,"If the company controls the chest, they
controls the sea."
578,JACK SPARROW,578,"A truly discomforting notion, love."
579,GIBBS,579,"And bad. Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate. I think
there's a bit more speed to be coaxed
from these sails. Brace the foreyard!"

by these?"
581,ELIZABETH SWANN,581,Persuasion.
582,JACK SPARROW,582,Friendly?
583,ELIZABETH SWANN,583,Decidedly not.
584,JACK SPARROW,584,"Will strikes a deal for these and upholds
it with honor. Yet you're the one standing
here with the prize. Full pardon, commission
as a privateer on behalf of England
and the East India Trading Company.
As if I could be bought for such a low
price."
585,ELIZABETH SWANN,585,"Jack, the Letters, give them back."

a sword."
588,JACK SPARROW,588,As I said... Persuade me.
589,NORRINGTON,589,"It's a curious thing. There was a time
when I would've given anything for you
to look like that while thinking about
me."

591,NORRINGTON,591,"Oh, I think you do."

all."

fianc√© ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?"
594,BELLAMY,594,"Strange thing to come upon a longboat
so far out in open waters."
595,WILL TURNER,595,"Just put as many leagues behind us as
you can. As fast as you can."
596,BELLAMY,596,And what are we running from?
597,WILL TURNER,597,That dress. Where did you get it?
598,BELLAMY,598,"It was found aboard the ship. The crew
it thought it was a spirit bringing
some omen of ill fate."
599,WILL TURNER,599,That's foolish.
600,QUARTERMASTER,600,"Oh, yes. ?Proceededly foolish."
601,BURSAR,601,"It brought good fortune! The spirit
told us... Put in at Tortuga. And we
made a nice bit of profit there."

jumped ship there."

Right here. Right on this deck. Right...

632,ELIZABETH SWANN,632,You seem very certain.
633,JACK SPARROW,633,"One word love: curiosity. You long for
freedom. You long to do what you want
to do because you want it. To act on
selfish impulse. You want to see what
it's like. One day, you won't be able
to resist."
634,ELIZABETH SWANN,634,Why doesn't your Compass work?
635,JACK SPARROW,635,Uh my Compass works fine.

will come a moment when you have a chance
to show it. To do the right thing."

at them as they pass by."

something courageous. And when you do,
you'll discover something: that you're
a good man."

640,ELIZABETH SWANN,640,I have faith in you. Want to know why?
641,JACK SPARROW,641,"Do tell, dearie."
642,ELIZABETH SWANN,642,"Curiosity. You're going to want it.
A chance to be admired. And gain the
rewards that follow. You won't be able
to resist. You're going to want to know...
what it tastes like."
643,JACK SPARROW,643,I *do* want to know what it tastes like.
