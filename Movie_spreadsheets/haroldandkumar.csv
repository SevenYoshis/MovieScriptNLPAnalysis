0,MAN (O.S.),0,Billy Boy!
1,J.D.,1,"Get your ass ready! It's almost five
o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his
drink on!"
2,J.D.,2,"Oh God. Give me that.     I'm burning it
once and for all."
3,BILLY,3,Don't!
4,J.D.,4,"Dude, it's been six months.    You have to
move on."
5,J.D.,5,"You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot
chick riding your jock all night long."
6,BILLY,6,"You're such a romantic, J.D."
7,J.D.,7,It would help get your mind off of Sarah.
8,BILLY,8,"Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other
women, I wouldn't even know what to do.
I've been out of the game so long."
9,J.D.,9,"Billy, you come out with me tonight, and
I promise you'll get laid."
10,BILLY,10,"Sounds tempting, but I can't. Berenson
needs me to update the financial models
for his meeting with the foreign
investors."
11,J.D.,11,"So what? It's Friday!      You have all
weekend to do that."
12,BILLY,12,"No I don't. The Germans are taking an
earlier flight back, so the meeting's
been moved to tomorrow."
13,J.D.,13,"Well, why don't you just get somebody
else to do your work then?"
14,BILLY,14,Who?
15,BILLY,15,"Harold, listen, I need you to update
these models for me."
16,HAROLD,16,But aren't you supposed to...
17,BILLY,17,"I know, but something came up. I have to
meet with some clients tonight, so I
won't be able to get to it. It's your
responsibility now. Okay?"
18,J.D.,18,"And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine
o'clock sharp."
19,J.D. (cont'd),19,"With all the downsizing going on around
here, we wouldn't want to have to tell
Berenson that you've been slacking. He's
just dying to figure out who he should
fire next."
20,HAROLD,20,Uh...okay...no problem...
21,BILLY,21,Wow!   I can't believe how easy that was!
22,J.D.,22,"Dude, how do you think I get all my shit
done? I'm telling you -- those Asian
guys love crunching numbers. You
probably just made his weekend."
23,J.D.,23,"Now get ready. It's time we embark
on...Operation Get Some!"
24,HAROLD,24,Fuck.
25,KUMAR,25,"Mononucleosis or mono is an infection
caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.
Symptoms may include fever, sore throat,
headaches, white patches on the back of
your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness
and loss of appetite."
26,DR. WOODRUFF,26,"Excellent, Kumar. I have to say you're
one of the best applicants I've ever
interviewed. Not that it's a surprise.
Your father is very respected in his
field. You know he and I had some pretty
wild times when we were in med school."
27,KUMAR,27,Really?
28,DR. WOODRUFF,28,"Yeah. We started our own basketball team--
the Hemoglobin Trotters..."
29,DR. WOODRUFF,29,"Yeah, we were crazy."
30,DR. WOODRUFF,30,Anyway-- just one more question.
31,DR. WOODRUFF,31,"What are some potential symptoms of
pancreatitis?"
32,KUMAR,32,"Let's see. There might be epigastric
tenderness, diffuse abdominal
tenderness..."
33,KUMAR,33,I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second?
34,KUMAR,34,Kumar's phone. Kumar speaking.
35,KUMAR,35,"Oh, hey."
36,KUMAR,36,Nothing important. I can talk. What's up?
37,HAROLD,37,"I'm not gonna be able to partake in our
usual Friday night ritual. I've gotta
stay late at the office."
38,KUMAR,38,Fuck that shit! We had plans!
39,HAROLD,39,"I know, but I gotta get this work done."
40,KUMAR,40,"Oh come on! When has getting high ever
prevented you from finishing your work?"
41,HAROLD (O.S.),41,"Listen, I'd love to go home, but..."
42,KUMAR,42,"No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter
of the finest herb in New York City, and
I'm not smoking it alone."
43,KUMAR (cont'd),43,"So you're just gonna have to chill the
fuck out, bring your work home, and
prepare to get blazed, because in a
couple of hours I expect both of us to be
blitzed out of our skulls. Got it?...Okay
good. See you later."
44,KUMAR,44,"Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More
symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased
bowel sounds, possibly fever,
dehydration, and sometimes even shock."
45,DR. WOODRUFF,45,"Mr. Patel. This is supposed to be a
proper interview. Do you actually believe
after the way you've behaved that I would
ever even consider recommending you for
admission?"
46,KUMAR,46,No.    I'd actually be pretty surprised.
47,KUMAR,47,"Look, I'm just interviewing so my dad
will keep paying for my apartment. I'm
not really planning on going to med
school."
48,DR. WOODRUFF,48,But...you have perfect MCAT scores!
49,KUMAR,49,"Well, I'm not an idiot."
50,KUMAR,50,Wow!    Is this your daughter?
51,HAROLD,51,Yes!   Right in front...
52,HAROLD,52,Those assholes.
53,COLE,53,"This is America, dude! Learn how to
drive!"
54,EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1,54,Better ruck tomorrow!
55,HAROLD,55,"Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous."
56,HAROLD,56,"So Maria, what's been going on?"
57,MARIA,57,"Oh, nothing. It's just been a long week.
How about you?"
58,HAROLD,58,"My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I
caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy
who works next to me decided to bathe for
a change."
59,MARIA,59,Really?
60,"HAROLD
(deadpan)",60,"Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of
that. Work sucked. I barely slept. And
the guy next to me still smells like
crap. But a man can dream, right?"
61,HAROLD,61,So what are you up to tonight?
62,MARIA,62,"Actually, I'm probably gonna work out a
little bit, clean up the apartment, and
then go over to my boyfriend's place.
He's cooking me a really nice dinner."
63,HAROLD,63,Really?
64,MARIA,64,"Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of
that."
65,MARIA,65,"I'll actually probably just sit on my
ass, eat a pint of Hagaan Daz, and watch
Blind Date."
66,HAROLD,66,That sounds awful.
67,HAROLD,67,"Well, if you want some company, maybe you
could sit on your ass at my place."
68,MARIA,68,Maybe.
69,MARIA,69,Bye.
70,HAROLD,70,Bye.
71,HAROLD,71,Kumar?
72,KUMAR (O.C.),72,"Yeah, I'm in here!"
73,HAROLD,73,Kumar?
74,KUMAR (O.C.),74,In here...
75,HAROLD,75,"Kumar, what the hell are you doing!"
76,KUMAR,76,I'm trimming my pubes.
77,HAROLD,77,Why aren't you doing this in your room!
78,KUMAR,78,The mirror's in here.
79,KUMAR,79,"Hey, check it out! It looks like a Bonsai
tree!"
80,HAROLD,80,I'm gonna puke. Get your clothes on.
81,"DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    11.
KUMAR",81,"Chill out. It makes my Johnson look
bigger. Besides, if I don't do this, I'll
end up with pubes like my dad. You've
seen Osama Bin Laden's beard, right?"
82,HAROLD,82,"Are those my scissors? Oh my God!     I
trim my nose hair with those!"
83,KUMAR,83,"Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with
them for the past six months."
84,HAROLD,84,GET THE HELL OUT OF MY ROOM!
85,"KUMAR
(calling out to Harold)",85,"So what the hell is your problem, anyway?"
86,HAROLD (O.C.),86,Other than my roommate's boney ass?
87,"HAROLD
(calling out)",87,"One of the senior analysts asked me to do
a bunch of his work for him tonight."
88,KUMAR,88,"I assume you gave him the appropriate ""go
fuck yourself."""
89,HAROLD,89,"If by ""go fuck yourself"" you mean ""no
problem sir"" then yes, he got the message
loud and clear."
90,KUMAR,90,"Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me
today. Dude, you gotta learn how to say
""no"" once in a while. Now lets get high."
91,HAROLD,91,No.   I got a lot of work to finish.
92,KUMAR,92,"Fuck that! You'll have plenty of time to
get that shit done later. Come on, let's
smoke a couple joints."
93,HAROLD,93,One joint.
94,KUMAR,94,One and a half. Now let's do this...
95,MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT,95,"Kumar...it is daddy. I hope your
interview today was good. I'm calling to
remind you that you have another one
tomorrow morning with Dr. Wein from
Cornell at 10:00 a.m. Do not be late!"
96,MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT,96,"It is very important you show up on time!
Mommy and I will be very upset if you do
not go. Good luck, Kumar. Remember, the
meeting is at ten o'clock. Bye bye."
97,HAROLD,97,"Don't you think you should take at least
one of your interviews seriously? At some
point your dad's gonna get really pissed."
98,KUMAR,98,"So what? It's not like there's a
shortage of Dr. Patel's out there. My
dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor.
Just because everyone in my family went
to med school, doesn't mean I have to."
99,HAROLD,99,"Well, then what are you going to do?"
100,KUMAR,100,"I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm
gonna smoke this fat blunt, get
ridiculously high, and then get something
to eat."
101,HAROLD,101,Sounds like a plan.
102,KUMAR,102,I think we've already seen this one.
103,KUMAR,103,"Come on, dude. Just take one hit.       Don't
you want to be cool?"
104,KUMAR,104,"Hey man, what are you doing?"
105,BROWN HAIRED KID,105,I'm so high!    Nothing can hurt me!
106,BROWN HAIRED KID,106,Marijuana kills.
107,KUMAR,107,I love that shit!
108,KUMAR,108,"Tonight...a Cheetah escaped from the
Morristown Zoo..."
109,HAROLD,109,Nice.   Sixteen Candles is on.
110,KUMAR,110,"And the award for least heterosexual
statement ever made in this apartment
goes to..."
111,(MORE),111,DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003       15.
112,KUMAR (cont'd),112,...Harold Lee! Come on down! Take a bow!
113,HAROLD,113,"Oh come on. It's a John Hughes movie!
It's a classic! It's a beautiful story
about someone who feels unnoticed,
unappreciated, unloved..."
114,KUMAR,114,Hey look!   It's you!
115,KUMAR,115,"Hey, when are you gonna start doing some
chores around here?"
116,HAROLD,116,We're so high right now.
117,KUMAR,117,We're not low.
118,HAROLD,118,"I don't know about you, but I'm hungry as
balls."
119,KUMAR,119,No shit!    Let's eat!
120,KUMAR,120,"Nah, I don't feel like delivery tonight."
121,HAROLD,121,What about KFC?
122,KUMAR,122,"Nah, we've been there too many times."
123,KUMAR,123,"I want something we haven't had in
awhile. Something different. Something
that'll really hit the spot. I want the
perfect food..."
124,VOICE ON TV,124,Are you hungry?
125,VOICE ON TV,125,"Then come to White Castle and try our
Slyder Special-- six burgers, fries, and
a soft drink for only 2.99."
126,VOICE ON TV,126,"Imagine all those burgers in your stomach
right now. Mmmmmh...."
127,VOICE ON TV,127,"Don't you like food that's tasty and
delicious?"
128,VOICE ON TV,128,"Then what are you waiting for? Head over
to White Castle. It's what you crave."
129,HAROLD,129,"You're sure you know how to get there?   I
haven't been to White Castle in ages."
130,KUMAR,130,"I'm telling you, there's one right around
the corner from that multiplex in New
Brunswick."
131,KUMAR,131,"Rosenberg, Goldstein-- get up.    We're
going to White Castle."
132,ROSENBERG,132,Wait-- we're watching The Gift on HBO.
133,KUMAR,133,No waiting.   We're starving...
134,KUMAR,134,"...Put that down! We're not eating `til
we get to White Castle."
135,KUMAR,135,"Now come on guys, let's go."
136,GOLDSTEIN,136,"Sorry man! We're not going anywhere.
Supposedly, Katie Holmes shows her milk
paps in this movie!"
137,HAROLD,137,"Is that all you Jews ever think about?
Tits?"
138,ROSENBERG,138,"We're talking about Katie Holmes here.
You would never think a sweet, innocent
girl like her would ever take her top
off. Which is precisely why we have to
watch her do it."
139,GOLDSTEIN,139,(beat)
140,ROSENBERG,140,That's a very vulgar statement.
141,GOLDSTEIN,141,"So is ""I want to pound Britney Spears in
the pussy."" But it's true."
142,ROSENBERG,142,Touché.
143,ROSENBERG,143,"Anyway, if you guys want to wait till the
movie's over..."
144,KUMAR,144,What the hell are you bringing that for?
145,HAROLD,145,"You're driving. I'm gonna try to get
some of my work done in the car."
146,KUMAR,146,"Shit, I forgot my cell phone."
147,HAROLD,147,Why don't you just run back and get it?
148,KUMAR,148,"Nah, we've gone too far."
149,KUMAR,149,"Hey, there's your girlfriend. You
actually gonna talk to her this time?"
150,KUMAR,150,"What the hell are you doing? That was a
perfect opportunity! You could have asked
her if she wanted to go to White Castle."
151,KUMAR,151,You're worthless.
152,HAROLD,152,I'm not worthwhile.
153,KUMAR,153,"Dude, it's only awkward because you're a
pussy. Just talk to her once and I
promise you it won't be weird anymore..."
154,HAROLD,154,"It doesn't matter. The only girls
interested in me are girls I have no
interest in. Like Cindy Kim."
155,KUMAR,155,"Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier.
One of those 58 Asian clubs she's in is
throwing a party at her dorm tonight."
156,HAROLD,156,"God, she invites me to everything."
157,KUMAR,157,"So what? She's fucking cute.     Let her
touch your penis."
158,COLE,158,"Hey look, it's the Brother's McFag!"
159,(to Harold and Kumar),159,"Let me guess, the yellow one's the
catcher!"
160,COLE,160,"Come on, guys! Let's get ourselves some
fucking Mountain Dew!"
161,EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1,161,Extreme!
162,HAROLD,162,Why do I have to be the catcher?
163,KUMAR,163,"Dude, forget about those pricks.    Let's
just go."
164,KUMAR,164,"Jesus, that took forever. You know the
purpose of a car is to avoid walking."
165,KUMAR,165,"And what kind of parking job is this?
You're like a mile away from the curb."
166,HAROLD,166,Don't even start.
167,KUMAR,167,"Just fucking with you.   Now let's go out
and get those burgers.   I'm fucking
starving!"
168,KUMAR,168,"Hey, Rold-- do you think C3PO is gay?"
169,HAROLD,169,"Of course he's gay! You remember in the
first Star Wars when he was like..."
170,HAROLD,170,"""Thank the maker! This oil bath is going
to feel soooo good!"""
171,KUMAR,171,"Dude, give me thirty-five cents."
172,KUMAR,172,What's going on? It didn't register.
173,KUMAR,173,"Dude, give me thirty-five more cents."
174,HAROLD,174,I don't have anymore change.
175,KUMAR,175,Should I just go through?
176,HAROLD,176,No.   I don't like breaking the law.
177,KUMAR,177,I can see that.
178,BIG BURLY GUY,178,Hey!    Move your ass!
179,KUMAR,179,I'm going through.
180,HAROLD,180,"Just hold on. I'll walk over to one of
the manned booths and tell them what
happened."
181,BIG BURLY GUY,181,"Move, you fucking twat!"
182,HAROLD,182,Are you crazy?
183,HAROLD,183,"Oh shit, we're dead!"
184,KUMAR,184,What the fuck is wrong with you?!
185,HAROLD,185,"You just tore out of there! The cops are
gonna catch us!"
186,KUMAR,186,No they're not!
187,HAROLD,187,Take this exit!
188,KUMAR,188,What?
189,KUMAR,189,That was the last of our weed.
190,HAROLD,190,"Look, I get a little paranoid sometimes."
191,KUMAR,191,"Now we're in Newark of all places.    You
know we're gonna get shot."
192,HAROLD,192,"Maybe it's not as bad as they say.    It's
probably just a bunch of hype."
193,HAROLD,193,Let's get the hell out of here.
194,HAROLD,194,What the...
195,HAROLD,195,"Dude, we are NOT driving through that
basketball game!"
196,KUMAR,196,We have to if we want to get out of here.
197,HAROLD,197,Forget about it. No way.
198,KUMAR,198,"Come on. How do you know they're not
peaceful Gregory Hines-like black guys?"
199,HAROLD,199,Turn the car around.
200,KUMAR,200,"Why? Are cars not allowed to go through
when a game's going on? When we were
kids, we used to move to the side when we
were playing in the street."
201,HAROLD,201,"For some reason, I don't think this is
the same thing."
202,KUMAR,202,I'm going through.
203,HAROLD,203,Don't!
204,KUMAR,204,Look.    They're moving.   I told you.
205,HAROLD,205,"Shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us."
206,KUMAR,206,How do you know?
207,"DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003   25.

208,KUMAR,208,Oh fuck.
209,RANDOM BASKETBALL PLAYER,209,"Man, you scared the shit out of them!
Make that face again!"
210,HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN,210,"Okay, okay, okay..."
211,HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN,211,Shit.   I can't do it.
212,HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN,212,Hold up.   Hold up...
213,HAROLD,213,"That was close, dude."
214,KUMAR,214,"Rold, check it out!      We're almost there!"
215,HAROLD,215,Yes!    Thank God! I'm starving!
216,KUMAR,216,"Well, prepare to gorge yourself."
217,HAROLD,217,"Oh man, I'm so hungry. I'm gonna eat like
twenty of those burgers."
218,KUMAR,218,"I'll see your twenty and raise you five
orders of fries."
219,HAROLD,219,"God, where the hell is this place?"
220,KUMAR,220,"Don't worry, we'll find it."
221,HAROLD,221,There's the multiplex!
222,KUMAR,222,"That means the White Castle should be
just around the corner..."
223,HAROLD,223,"What the hell's going on, Kumar?! That
doesn't look like a White Castle to me!"
224,KUMAR,224,We gotta get to the bottom of this!
225,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,225,"I'm sorry. You have to order at the
drive thru menu..."
226,KUMAR,226,What happened to the White Castle?
227,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,227,Excuse me?
228,KUMAR,228,"There used to be a White Castle right in
this spot. Where is it?"
229,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,229,"Oh yeah. There was a White Castle here.
Look guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad
news, but Burger Shack bought this
location four years ago."
230,KUMAR,230,"Please tell me there's another White
Castle in town."
231,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,231,Nope.
232,HAROLD,232,Are you sure?
233,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,233,"Do I look like the type of guy who would
be unsure about something like this?"
234,KUMAR,234,Shit.   What are we gonna do?
235,HAROLD,235,I don't know. Should we just eat here?
236,KUMAR,236,Do you really think that'll satisfy us?
237,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,237,"There's a 24 hour White Castle in Cherry
Hill, about forty-five minutes away."
238,KUMAR,238,I can make the trip if you're willing to.
239,HAROLD,239,"Kumar, I have a shitload of work to
finish. And you have that med school
interview in the morning."
240,KUMAR,240,"Forget about the med school interview.
It's a non-issue."
241,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,241,If I may interject for a moment...
242,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,242,"I've been an employee here for three
years now, and if there's one thing I've
learned, it's that when you're craving
White Castle, the burgers here simply
won't cut it."
243,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,243,"In fact, just thinking about those tender
little White Castle burgers and those
grilled onions makes me want to burn this
place to the ground and re-build a White
Castle in its place."
244,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,244,"If I were you, I'd suck it up and make
the trip."
245,KUMAR,245,You can always do your work in the car.
246,HAROLD,246,Let's do it.
247,KUMAR,247,"Then it's settled. No matter what, we're
not ending this night without White
Castle in our stomachs. Agreed?"
248,HAROLD,248,Agreed.
249,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,249,"Wise choice. Besides, you wouldn't want
to go near our special sauce tonight.
Some of the guys and I added an extra
ingredient, if you know what I mean."
250,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,250,I'll give you a hint...
251,BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE,251,It's semen.
252,KUMAR,252,"White Castle, here we come. I just wish
we had some more pot. I'm almost
completely sober right now."
253,KUMAR,253,Nice. Princeton. We're getting off here.
254,HAROLD,254,Why?
255,KUMAR,255,"We're gonna sweet talk Cindy Kim into
finding us some weed."
256,HAROLD,256,Oh no.    I'm not seeing Cindy.
257,KUMAR,257,"Why the fuck not? You talk to her on the
phone all the time."
258,HAROLD,258,"She calls me. Then she rambles on about
her East Asian Students club or whatever."
259,HAROLD (cont'd),259,"And I have to pretend like I actually
give a shit, or she'll call me a twinkie."
260,KUMAR,260,A twinkie?
261,HAROLD,261,"You know, yellow on the outside, white on
the inside."
262,KUMAR,262,"Look you twinkie bitch, you threw our
weed out the window, so now it's your
duty to make sure we're high as shit by
the time we're eating those burgers."
263,HAROLD,263,"Well, I can't help you out there. Cindy
doesn't smoke. She's not gonna help us."
264,KUMAR,264,"As long as she buzzes us into a dorm,
we're set. Give me ten minutes in there
and I guarantee I'll find some hizzy."
265,HAROLD,265,"No, forget it. I'm not seeing Cindy Kim."

to the envelope I sent you?"
269,HAROLD,269,"Uh, yeah.    They were...nice."

you're an analyst at Brewster Keegan?"

273,KENNETH,273,Awesome!
274,HAROLD,274,Yes?
275,KENNETH,275,"Uh, this is actually a two-part question.
I'm applying for a summer internship at
Brewster Keegan, and I was wondering a)
what it's like being an investment banker
and b) if you would write me a
recommendation."
276,HAROLD,276,"What it's like being an investment
banker? Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's
pretty..."
277,HAROLD,277,...awesome?
278,HAROLD,278,"As for the recommendation, I may be able
to make a call or two..."
279,CINDY,279,"Actually Harold, we should be getting to
the party. We can discuss all this stuff
there. It's just down the hall."
280,HAROLD,280,"Sorry, Cindy. I can't go. I have to wait
for Kumar..."
281,CINDY,281,"You'll see him when we're done. Trust me,
you're gonna love this. Kenny's mom
dropped off a big jar of kimchi jigae."
282,HAROLD,282,Nice.

chronic?"
284,KUMAR,284,What kind of Ivy League school is this?

bro!"

like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy
it. That's cool with me. I can find lots
of people who want to get high. I can
smoke it myself, man."

you?"

bunch of Phish records while you read
your lame ass poetry."
298,CINDY,298,Sorry.    Harold's coming with us.
299,KUMAR,299,"That's bullshit. He's coming with me.
Isn't that right, Rold?"
300,HAROLD,300,Let's go to the party for a little while.
301,KUMAR,301,Fuck that!
302,KUMAR,302,"Here-- this is Harold's understudy.     You
can do whatever you want with him."
303,KUMAR,303,Let's go.
304,KUMAR,304,"I can't believe you were gonna ditch me
for the Joy Luck Club. You know what
their parties are like."
305,HAROLD,305,"Look, what do you want me to say?     I was
under pressure."
306,KUMAR,306,"Just say ""no""! That's all it takes.      Now
take a hit of this."

308,SECURITY GUARD,308,"Hey, get back here!"
309,KUMAR,309,Quick.    In here.
310,HAROLD,310,Shit!    What if he finds us?
311,KUMAR,311,"Dude, chill out. He's not gonna look for
us in the women's bathroom."
312,KUMAR,312,Shit!    Get in that stall!
313,CHRISTY,313,"Hurry up, I want to go smoke pot with
that cute Indian bloke."
314,CLARISSA,314,"It'll be a few minutes, I'm about to have
the worst case of the taco shits."
315,HAROLD,315,Ew...gross.
316,CHRISTY,316,Oh great.   Now I think I have to go.
317,CLARISSA,317,Ahhhhh!
318,CHRISTY,318,"Hey Clarissa. Do you wanna play battle
shits?"
319,CLARISSA,319,"Oh my God. We haven't played that since
back in camp!"
320,CHRISTY,320,Wait for it.    Wait for it.    Ahhhhh!
321,CLARISSA,321,Hit!
322,CINDY,322,Have you seen a Korean guy around here?
323,HIPPIE ASSHOLE,323,"Uh, yeah. There's like, two hundred of
them in this dorm."

334,KENNETH,334,"To tell you the truth, I'm running low.
But a quick titty flash may persuade me."
335,KUMAR,335,"Dude, I'm starting to think you made a
mistake by not going to this party..."

to getting high and getting laid."

weren't gonna get laid."
344,KUMAR,344,"Hey, the diarrhea twins would've had sex
with us! And what about Cindy?! She was
looking hot tonight! The fact that you're
not into her just might make you gay!"
345,HAROLD,345,"I know Cindy's cute, it's just..."
346,KUMAR,346,What?   You'd rather have Maria?
347,HAROLD,347,"Look, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna end
up with Cindy anyway. It's just more
practical. Now can we drop this and get
our asses to White Castle?"

you...why are you peeing here?"

next to me? Why not that bush over there?"
355,CREEPY GUY,355,"Well, this looked like a good bush to pee
on. Why'd you choose this bush?"
356,KUMAR,356,Nobody was here when I chose this bush.
357,CREEPY GUY,357,"So you can pee here and nobody else can,
is that it?"
358,KUMAR,358,I was just saying....
359,CREEPY GUY,359,"Is this like your special bush or
something?"

need to sedate the patient first or else
he could go into cardiac arrest."

marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate

need marijuana now! Get as much of it as
possible! Like a big bag of it!"

want stat x-rays of the chest and
abdomen. Give me two large bore IVs and
start a ringers lactate push. Nurse, we
need 2 units of O neg on board."

lung. Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat!"

in and wrap this up?"

hour from home. And who do we see, but
your dream girl standing outside a
theater playing your favorite movie. I
mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic
comedy, and I was your annoying gay
friend, this would be the moment I'd tell
you ""this is a sign."""

yourself said things are starting to go

got baked and started throwing shit off

talking about?"
483,KUMAR,483,"Oh shit. That's right. I was with

that just because you're whispering, he
can't hear what you're saying? He's two
feet away from us. He can hear this

other very much."

Show...end up with a woman like yourself?"
508,LIANE,508,"Well, I met him at choir practice `bout
four years ago. Freak Show was very shy
back then-- you know, because of all the
hideous boils on his face and neck. But
he had the most amazing voice -- like a
baby canary."
509,LIANE,509,"Well, one day after Easter service, I
told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and
he just mustered up some courage and
asked me out. The rest is history. And
we've been in love ever since."

first?"

Show...and this whole Christian thing you
guys have going on?"

about our Lord, you assume we don't know
how to have a good time?"

how to get us back on the highway."

get going? I'm bored as shit back here."

ever get it on with Wanda off the set?"

Let's get us some poon-tang. Then we'll
go to White Castle."

craving these burgers all night."

thought, ""How can I still give them shit?

655,HAROLD,655,Come on.   Seriously.
656,TARIK,656,"I am serious. You wanna know what
happened?"
657,TARIK,657,"I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble,
and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black
man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore,
since I'm black, it was probably me,
right?"
658,TARIK,658,"Well that was the logic the cop used. I
told him I haven't even been to Newark in
months. Then he pointed a gun at me and
told me to stop resisting arrest. I
said, ""Hey, I'm not resisting anything.""
So he starts beating me with his gun,
screaming at me, telling me to stop
resisting."
659,HAROLD,659,Holy shit.   What did you do?
660,TARIK,660,"I kept saying, ""I understand that I'm
under arrest. Please stop beating me.""
But that didn't work. Then another cop
showed up. Then another. When it was
all said and done, it took nine cops to
bring me in here."
661,HAROLD,661,That fucking blows!
662,HAROLD,662,"I don't understand how you're able to be
so calm about all this."

down about you and leave."
