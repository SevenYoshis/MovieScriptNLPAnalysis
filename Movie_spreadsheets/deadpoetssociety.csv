1,PHOTOGRAPHER,1,"Okay, put your arm around your brother.
That's it. And breathe in."
2,PHOTOGRAPHR,2,"Okay, one more."
3,TEACHER,3,"Now just to review, you're going to
follow along the procession until you
get to the headmaster. At that point
he will indicate to you to light the
candles of the boys."
4,MAN,4,"All right boys, let's settle down."
5,MAN,5,Banners up.
6,MR NOLAN,6,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light
of knowledge."
7,MR NOLAN,7,"One hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this
room and were asked the same question that greets
you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what
are the four pillars?"
8,BOYS,8,"Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence."
9,MR NOLAN,9,"In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five
students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And
more than seventy-five percent of those went on to
the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is
the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught
here. This is why you parents have been sending us
your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory
school in the United States."
10,MR NOLAN,10,"As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English
department retired last term. You will have the
opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John
Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,
for the past several years, has been teaching at the
highly regarded Chester School in London."
11,MR NOLAN,11,Glad you could come by.
12,MR ANDERSON,12,Thrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan.
13,MR NOLAN,13,You've been away too long.
14,MRS ANDERSON,14,Hello Dr. Nolan.
15,MR NOLAN,15,Good to have you back.
16,MRS ANDERSON,16,"This is our youngest, Todd."
17,MR NOLAN,17,"Mr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill,
young man. Your brother was one of our finest."
18,TODD,18,Thank you.
19,WOMAN,19,Lovely ceremony.
20,MR NOLAN,20,Thank you. So glad you liked it.
21,MR PERRY,21,Gale
22,MR NOLAN,22,Tom
23,MR PERRY,23,Good to see you again.
24,NEIL,24,Hello Mr. Nolan.
25,MR NOLAN,25,Neil. We expect great things from you this year.
26,NEIL,26,"Thank you, sir."
27,MR PERRY,27,Well he won't disappoint us. Right Neil?
28,NEIL,28,I'll do my best sir.
29,FATHER,29,"Hey, come on son."
30,MOTHER,30,Chin up.
31,FATHER,31,No tears now.
32,BOY,32,Okay.
33,MOTHER,33,Chin up.
34,BOY,34,I don't want to go here.
35,MOTHER,35,You be a good boy and do your lessons.
36,NEIL,36,"Hey, I hear we're gonna be roommates."
37,NEIL,37,I'm Neil Perry.
38,TODD,38,Todd Anderson.
39,NEIL,39,Why'd you leave Balincrest?
40,TODD,40,My brother went here.
41,NEIL,41,"Oh, so you're that Anderson."
42,FATHER,42,"This is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you
give him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing
you can give him some of those."
43,HAGER,43,All right fine.
44,FATHER,44,Did you remember your vaporizer?
45,SPAZ,45,"Yes, I put it in my room."
46,KNOX,46,"Hey, how's it going Neil?"
47,NEIL,47,Hey Knox.
48,CAMERON,48,"Neil, study group tonight?"
49,NEIL,49,"Yeah, sure."
50,CAMERON,50,"Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new
kid. Looks like a stiff!"
51,CAMERON,51,Oops!
52,NEIL,52,"Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his
foot in his mouth. You know what I mean?"
53,CHARLIE,53,"Rumor has it, you did summer school."
54,NEIL,54,"Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
How was your summer Slick?"
55,CHARLIE,55,Keen.
56,CHARLIE,56,Meeks. Door. Closed.
57,MEEKS,57,Yes sir.
58,NEIL,58,"Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?"
59,BOYS,59,Travesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement.
60,CHARLIE,60,"Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite
flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study
group."
61,NEIL,61,"Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind
including him?"
62,CHARLIE,62,"Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?"
63,NEIL,63,"Come on, he's your roommate."
64,CHARLIE,64,That's not my fault.
65,MEEKS,65,"Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks."
66,NEIL,66,"Oh, this is Todd Anderson."
67,MEEKS,67,Nice to meet you.
68,TODD,68,Nice to meet you.
69,CHARLIE,69,Charlie Dalton.
70,KNOX,70,Knox Overstreet.
71,NEIL,71,Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.
72,CHARLIE,72,"Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar."
73,MEEKS,73,"Oh well, welcome to Hell-ton."
74,CHARLIE,74,"It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a
genius like Meeks."
75,MEEKS,75,He flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin.
76,CHARLIE,76,"And English, and Trig."
77,NEIL,77,It's open.
78,NEIL,78,"Father, I thought you'd gone."
79,BOYS,79,Mr. Perry.
80,MR PERRY,80,"Keep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've
just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking
too many extra curricular activities this semester, and
I've decided that you should drop the school annual."
81,NEIL,81,But I'm the assistant editor this year.
82,MR PERRY,82,Well I'm sorry Neil.
83,NEIL,83,"But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair."
84,MR PERRY,84,"Fellas, would you excuse us for a moment?"
85,MR PERRY,85,"Don't you ever dispute me in public. Do you
understand?"
86,NEIL,86,"Father, I wasn't disputing-"
87,NEIL,87,Yes sir. I'm sorry.
88,MR PERRY,88,"You know how much this means to your mother,
don't you?"
89,NEIL,89,"Yes sir. You know me, always taking on too much."
90,MR PERRY,90,"Well, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything,
you let us know, huh?"
91,NEIL,91,Yes sir.
92,CHARLIE,92,Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
93,KNOX,93,"Yeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse."
94,NEIL,94,"Oh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr.
Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker."
95,CHARLIE,95,"Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do."
96,NEIL,96,"Well just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You
guys are the same way."
97,KNOX,97,"All right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do?"
98,NEIL,98,What I have to do. Drop the annual.
99,CHARLIE,99,"Well I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a
bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan."
100,NEIL,100,I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.
101,MEEKS,101,"Well, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room?"
102,NEIL,102,Yes.
103,MEEKS,103,"Todd, you're welcome to join us."
104,KNOX,104,"Yeah, come along pal."
105,TODD,105,Thanks.
106,MCALLISTER,106,"Slow down boys, slow down you horrible
phalanx of pubescense."
107,TEACHER,107,"Pick three laboratory experiments from
the project list and report on them every
five weeks. The first twenty questions at
the end of chapter one are due tomorrow."
108,MCALLISTER,108,"Agricolam. Agricola. Agricolae.
Agricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas.
Agrilcolis.
Again, please.
Agricola."
109,HAGER,109,"Your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision.
Anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will
be penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge
you now not to test me on this point."
110,KNOX,110,"Hey Spaz, Spaz."
111,CAMERON,111,Brain damage.
112,KEATING,112,Well come on.
113,KEATING,113,"""Oh Captain, My Captain"" who knows where
that comes from?"
114,KEATING,114,"Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt
Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in
this class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,
if you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,
My Captain."
115,KEATING,115,"Now let me dispel a few rumors so they
don't fester into facts. Yes, I too
attended Hell-ton and survived. And no,
at that time I was not the mental giant
you see before you. I was the intellectual
equivalent of a ninety-eight pound
weakling. I would go to the beach and
people would kick copies of Byron in my
face."
116,KEATING,116,"Now, Mr Pitts. That's a rather
unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are
you?"
117,PITTS,117,"""To the virgins, to make much of time""?"
118,KEATING,118,"Yes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate,
isn't it."
119,PITTS,119,"""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old
time is still a flying, and this same
flower that smiles today, tomorrow will
be dying."""
120,KEATING,120,"Thank you Mr. Pitts. ""Gather ye rosebuds
while ye may."" The Latin term for that
sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows
what that means?"
121,MEEKS,121,"Carpe Diem. That's ""seize the day."""
122,KEATING,122,"Very good, Mr.-"
123,MEEKS,123,Meeks.
124,KEATING,124,"Meeks. Another unusual name. Seize the
day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.
Why does the writer use these lines?"
125,CHARLIE,125,Because he's in a hurry.
126,KEATING,126,"No, ding!"
127,KEATING,127,"Thank you for playing anyway. Because we
are food for worms lads. Because, believe
it or not, each and every one of us in
this room is one day going to stop
breathing, turn cold, and die."
128,KEATING,128,"Now I would like you to step forward over
here and peruse some of the faces from
the past. You've walked past them many
times. I don't think you've really looked
at them."
129,KEATING,129,"They're not that different from you, are
they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones,
just like you. Invincible, just like you
feel. The world is their oyster. They
believe they're destined for great things,
just like many of you. Their eyes are full
of hope, just like you. Did they wait until
it was too late to make from their lives
even one iota of what they were capable?
Because you see gentlmen, these boys are
now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen
real close, you can hear them whisper their
legacy to you. Go on, lean in."
130,KEATING,130,Carpe.
131,KEATING,131,Hear it?
132,KEATING,132,"Carpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,
make your lives extraordinary."
133,PITTS,133,That was weird.
134,NEIL,134,But different.
135,KNOX,135,Spooky if you ask me.
136,CAMERON,136,Think he'll test us on that stuff?
137,CHARLIE,137,"Come on Cameron, don't you get anything?"
138,CAMERON,138,What? What?
139,COACH,139,"Let's go boys, hustle up in here. That
means you Dalton."
140,MEEKS,140,"Okay, who's up for a trig study group
tonight guys?"
141,PITTS,141,Me.
142,NEIL,142,Me.
143,CHARLIE,143,What?
144,KNOX,144,"I can't make it guys. I have to have
dinner at the Danburry's house."
145,PITTS,145,The Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's?
146,CAMERON,146,Big alumns. How'd you swing that?
147,KNOX,147,"Friends of my Dad's. They're probably in
their nineties or something."
148,CHARLIE,148,Ooh!
149,NEIL,149,Anything's better than Hell-ton hash.
150,CHARLIE,150,I'll second that.
151,KNOX,151,Yeah we'll see.
152,NEIL,152,"Hey, you coming to the study group tonight?"
153,TODD,153,"Uh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I
wanna do."
154,NEIL,154,Suit yourself.
155,HAGER,155,Ready Overstreet?
156,KNOX,156,Ready to go sir.
157,MRS DANBURRY (O.S.),157,"Chet, can you get that?"
158,CHET (O.S.),158,"I can't, Mom."
159,CHRIS (O.S.),159,I'll get it.
160,CHRIS,160,Can I help you?
161,KNOX,161,"Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager."
162,CHRIS,162,Hi.
163,KNOX,163,"This is the Danburry's, right?"
164,CHRIS,164,Are you here to see Chet?
165,KNOX,165,Mrs. Danburry?
166,CHRIS,166,No.
167,MRS DANBURRY,167,"Sorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry.
You must be Knox."
168,KNOX,168,Yes.
169,MRS DANBURRY,169,Back by nine.
170,MRS DANBURRY,170,Please come in.
171,CHET (O.S.),171,"Chris, come on, what are you doing?"
172,CHRIS,172,"Chet, I'm coming."
173,MR DANBURRY,173,Knox. How are you? Joe Danburry.
174,KNOX,174,Nice to meet you sir.
175,MR DANBURRY,175,"Well he's the spitting image of his father,
isn't he. How is he? Come on in."
176,CHET (O.S.),176,Chris!
177,KNOX,177,He's great. He just did a big case for GM.
178,CHRIS (O.S.),178,I'm coming.
179,MR DANBURRY,179,"I know where you're headed, like father
like son, huh?"
180,CAMERON,180,"Just replace these numbers here with ""x"",
for ""x"" and ""y""."
181,NEIL,181,Of course.
182,CAMERON,182,"Of course, so what's the problem?"
183,CHARLIE,183,How was dinner?
184,KNOX,184,Huh?
185,CHARLIE,185,How was dinner?
186,KNOX,186,Terrible. Awful.
187,CHARLIE,187,Why? What happened?
188,KNOX,188,"Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl
in my entire life."
189,NEIL,189,Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
190,KNOX,190,She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry.
191,CHARLIE,191,That guy could eat a football.
192,PITTS,192,That's too bad.
193,KNOX,193,"Too bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie,
it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in
love with such a jerk."
194,PITTS,194,"All the good ones go for jerks, you
know that."
195,CAMERON,195,"Ahh, forget her. Open your trig book and
try and figure out problem five."
196,KNOX,196,"I can't just forget her Cameron. And I
can't think about trig."
197,PITTS,197,We got it.
198,MEEKS,198,Holy cow.
199,HAGER,199,"All right gentlemen, five minutes. Let's
go."
200,CHARLIE,200,Did you see her naked?
201,KNOX,201,Very funny Dalton.
202,HAGER,202,"That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,
would it Mr. Pitts?"
203,PITTS,203,"No sir. Science experiment, radar."
204,KEATING,204,"Gentlemen, open your text to page
twenty-one of the introduction. Mr.
Perry, will you read the opening
paragraph of the preface, entitled
""Understanding Poetry""?"
205,NEIL,205,"Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans
Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand
poetry, we must first be fluent with
its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.
Then ask two questions: One, how artfully
has the objective of the poem been
rendered, and two, how important is that
objective. Question one rates the poem's
perfection, question two rates its
importance. And once these questions have
been answered, determining a poem's
greatest becomes a relatively simple
matter."
206,NEIL,206,"If the poem's score for perfection is
plotted along the horizontal of a graph,
and its importance is plotted on the
vertical, then calculating the total
area of the poem yields the measure of
its greatness."
207,NEIL,207,"A sonnet by Byron may score high on the
vertical, but only average on the
horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on
the other hand, would score high both
horizontally and vertically, yielding a
massive total area, thereby revealing the
poem to be truly great. As you proceed
through the poetry in this book, practice
this rating method. As your ability to
evaluate poems in this matter grows, so
will - so will your enjoyment and
understanding of poetry."
208,KEATING,208,"Excrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.
Evans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe,
we're talking about poetry."
209,KEATING,209,"I mean, how can you describe poetry like
American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give
him a 42, but I can't dance to it."
210,KEATING,210,Now I want you to rip out that page.
211,KEATING,211,"Go on, rip out the entire page. You heard
me, rip it out. Rip it out!"
212,KEATING,212,"Go on, rip it out."
213,KEATING,213,"Thank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you
what, don't just tear out that page, tear
out the entire introduction. I want it
gone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip
it out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard,
Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I
want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr.
Pritchard."
214,KEATING,214,"We'll perforate it, put it on a roll."
215,KEATING,215,"It's not the bible, you're not going to
go to hell for this. Go on, make a clean
tear, I want nothing left of it."
216,CAMERON,216,We shouldn't be doing this.
217,NEIL,217,"Rip, rip, rip!"
218,KEATING (O.S.),218,"Rip it out, rip!"
219,MCALLISTER,219,What the hell is going on here?
220,KEATING,220,I don't hear enough rips.
221,MCALLISTER,221,Mr. Keating.
222,KEATING,222,Mr. McAllister.
223,MCALLISTER,223,"I'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were
here."
224,KEATING,224,I am.
225,MCALLISTER,225,"Ahh, so you are. Excuse me."
226,KEATING,226,"Keep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle,
a war. And the casualties could be your
hearts and souls."
227,KEATING,227,"Thank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics
going forward, measuring poetry. No, we
will not have that here. No more of Mr.
J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you
will learn to think for yourselves again.
You will learn to savor words and language.
No matter what anybody tells you, words and
ideas can change the world. I see that look
in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century
literature has nothing to do with going to
business school or medical school. Right?
Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him,
thinking ""Yes, we should simply study our
Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter
and go quietly about the business of
achieving other ambitions."" I have a little
secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up!"
228,KEATING,228,"We don't read and write poetry because
it's cute. We read and write poetry
because we are members of the human race.
And the human race is filled with passion.
Medicine, law, business, engineering,
these are all noble pursuits, and necessary
to sustain life. But poetry, beauty,
romance, love, these are what we stay alive
for. To quote from Whitman: ""O me, o life
of the questions of these recurring, of the
endless trains of the faithless, of cities
filled with the foolish. What good amid
these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are
here. That life exists, and identity.
That the powerful play goes on, and you
may contribute a verse. That the powerful
play goes on and you may contribute a verse."
229,Keating,229,What will your verse be?
230,ALL,230,"For what we are about to receive, may the
Lord make us truly grateful. Amen."
231,MCALLISTER,231,"Quite an interesting class you gave today,
Mr. Keating."
232,KEATING,232,"I'm sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister."
233,MCALLISTER,233,"Oh, there's no need to apologize. It was
very fascinating, misguided though it was."
234,KEATING,234,You think so?
235,MCALLISTER,235,"You take a big risk by encouraging them to
be artists John. When they realize they're
not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,
they'll hate you for it."
236,KEATING,236,"We're not talking artists George, we're
talking free thinkers."
237,MCALLISTER,237,Free thinkers at seventeen?
238,KEATING,238,"Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic."
239,MCALLISTER,239,"Not a cynic, a realist. Show me the heart
unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll
show you a happy man."
240,KEATING,240,"But only in their dreams can man be truly
free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus
will be."
241,MCALLISTER,241,Tennyson?
242,KEATING,242,"No, Keating."
243,NEIL,243,"Hey, I found his senior annual in the
library."
244,NEIL,244,"Listen to this, captain of the soccer team,
editor of the school annual, Cambridge
bound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society."
245,CAMERON,245,Man most likely to do anything.
246,CHARLIE,246,Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.
247,KNOX,247,What's the Dead Poets Society?
248,NEIL,248,I don't know.
249,MEEKS,249,Is there a picture in the annual?
250,NEIL,250,Nothing. No other mention of it.
251,MR. NOLAN (O.S.),251,"That boy there, see me after lunch."
252,NEIL,252,"Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain,
My Captain?"
253,KEATING,253,Gentlemen.
254,NEIL,254,We were just looking in your old annual.
255,KEATING,255,"Oh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley
""The Tool"" Wilson-"
256,KEATING,256,God.
257,NEIL,257,What was the Dead Poets Society?
258,KEATING,258,"I doubt the present administration would
look too favorably upon that."
259,NEIL,259,Why? What was it?
260,KEATING,260,"Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?"
261,NEIL,261,Sure.
262,KEATING,262,"The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking
the marrow out of life. That's a phrase
from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the
beginning of each meeting. You see we'd
gather at the old Indian cave and take
turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman,
Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our
own verse. And in the enchantment of the
moment we'd let poetry work its magic."
263,KNOX,263,"You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting
around reading poetry?"
264,KEATING,264,"No Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just ""guys"",
we weren't a Greek organization, we were
romantics. We didn't just read poetry,
we let it drip from our tongues like honey.
Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods
were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to
spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry
for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that,
especially my picture."
265,NEIL,265,Dead Poets Society.
266,CAMERON,266,What?
267,NEIL,267,I say we go tonight.
268,CHARLIE,268,Tonight?
269,CAMERON,269,Wait a minute.
270,PITTS,270,Where's this cave he's talking about?

is."
272,PITTS,272,That's miles.

275,CAMERON,275,"You know how many de-merits we're talking
Dalton"
276,CHARLIE,276,"So don't come, please."
277,CAMERON,277,"Look, all I'm saying is that we have to
be careful, we can't get caught."

(yelling)",279,"You boys there, hurry up."
280,NEIL,280,"All right, who's in?"
281,CAMERON,281,"Come on Neil, Hager's right-"
282,NEIL,282,"Forget Hager, no. Who's in?"
283,CHARLIE,283,I'm in.
284,HAGER (O.S.),284,"I'm warning you, move."
285,CAMERON,285,Me too.
286,PITTS,286,I don't know Neil
287,NEIL,287,What? Pitts-
288,CHARLIE,288,"Pitsie, come on."
289,MEEKS,289,His grades are hurting Charlie.
290,NEIL,290,You can help him Meeks.
291,PITTS,291,"What is this, a midnight study group?"
292,NEIL,292,"Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks,
are your grades hurting too?"
293,MEEKS,293,I'll try anything once.
294,CHARLIE,294,Except sex.
295,MEEKS,295,Ha ha ha.
296,CAMERON,296,I mean as long as we're careful.
297,CHARLIE,297,What about you Knox?
298,KNOX,298,I don't know Charlie.
299,CHARLIE,299,"Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris."
300,KNOX,300,Yeah? How?
301,CHARLIE,301,Women swoon.
302,KNOX,302,"But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me
why they swoon. Charlie!"
303,NEIL,303,"Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall.
It's right there. It's got to be on the
banks."
304,CAMERON,304,"I don't know, it's starting to sound
dangerous."
305,CHARLIE,305,"Well, why don't you stay home?"
306,MCALLISTER,306,"For God's sake stop chattering and
sit down."
307,NEIL,307,"Todd, are you coming tonight?"
308,TODD,308,No.
309,NEIL,309,"Why not? God, you were there. You heard
Keating. Don't you want to do something
about it?"
310,TODD,310,"Yes, but-"
311,NEIL,311,But? But what?
312,TODD,312,"Keating said that everybody took turns
reading and I don't want to do that."
313,NEIL,313,"Gosh, you really have a problem with
that, don't you?"
314,TODD,314,"N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil,
I just- I just don't want to do it,
okay?"
315,NEIL,315,"All right. What if you didn't have to
read? What if you just came and
listened?"
316,TODD,316,That's not how it works.
317,NEIL,317,"Forget how it works. What if - what if
they said it was okay?"
318,TODD,318,"What? What are you gonna do, go up and
ask them?"
319,TODD,319,"No. No, Neil."
320,NEIL,320,I'll be right back.
321,TODD,321,"Neil, Neil!"
322,MCALLISTER,322,"Oh shut up, will you."
323,SPAZ,323,"That's my- that's for my asthma, okay.
Could you give that back please? Could
you give that back?"
324,BOY,324,What's the matter? Don't you like snakes?
325,NEIL,325,You're in.
326,SPAZ,326,"Get away from me, okay?"
327,BOY,327,"Spaz, why don't you check your pocket,
huh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my
teeth"
328,SPAZ,328,"Get a- get off,"
329,HAGER,329,Cut out that racket in there.
330,CHARLIE,330,"Arrr, I'm a dead poet."
331,MEEKS,331,"Aww, Charlie."
332,CHARLIE,332,"Guys, over here."
333,MEEKS,333,You're funny. You're real funny.
334,MEEKS,334,It's too wet.
335,CHARLIE,335,"God, are you trying to smoke us out of
here?"
336,MEEKS,336,"No, no, the smoke's going right up this
opening."
337,NEIL,337,You okay?
338,PITTS,338,Oh God. Clowns.
339,NEIL,339,"All right, all right, forget the fire.
Let's go gentlemen."
340,NEIL,340,"I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets
Society."
341,NEIL,341,"Welton chapter. The meetings will be
conducted by myself and the other new
initiates now present. Todd Anderson,
because he prefers not to read, will
keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now
read the traditional opening message by
society member Henry David Thoreau. ""I
went to the woods because I wanted to
live deliberately. I wanted to live deep
and suck out all the marrow of life."""
342,CHARLIE,342,I'll second that.
343,NEIL,343,"""To put to rout all that was not life,
and not, when I had come to die,
discover that I had not lived."

here. Right here, lay it down"
346,CAMERON,346,"On the mud? We're gonna put our food on
the mud?"
347,CHARLIE,347,"Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket."
348,MEEKS,348,"Yes sir, use Meeks' coat."
349,CHARLIE,349,"Don't keep anything back either. You
guys are always bumming my smokes."
350,NEIL,350,Raisins?
351,KNOX,351,Yuck.
352,CHARLIE,352,"Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll?"
353,PITTS,353,I'm eating the other half.
354,CHARLIE,354,Come on.
355,PITTS,355,You want me to put it back?

old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw
puzzles, sat by herself in her house at
her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.
But as she pieced the puzzle together, she
realized, to her astonishment, that the
image that was formed was her very own
room. And the figure in the center of the
puzzle, as she completed it, was herself.
And with trembling hands, she placed the
last four pieces and stared in horror at
the face of a demented madman at the
window. The last thing that this old lady
ever heard was the sound of breaking glass."
357,BOYS,357,Ohhh no
358,NEIL,358,"This is true, this is true."
359,CAMERON,359,"I've got one that's even better than
that."

out of gas, and there's a madman on the-"
362,CHARLIE,362,The thing with the hand-
363,CAMERON,363,I love that story.
364,CHARLIE,364,I told you that one.

it."
371,MEEKS,371,"What, did you bring one?"
372,NEIL,372,You memorized a poem?
373,CHARLIE,373,I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.
374,MEEKS,374,An original piece by Charlie Dalton.
375,KNOX,375,An original piece.
376,PITTS,376,Take center stage.
377,NEIL,377,"You know this is history. Right? This is
history."
378,MEEKS,378,"Oh, wow."

Come my friends,
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world
for my purpose holds to sail beyond the
sunset.
And though we are not now that strength
which in old days
Moved earth and heaven; that which we
are, we are;--
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong
in will.
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to
yield."

developed for one endeavor, and that is?
Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or
an amoeba?"
394,KEATING,394,Mr. Perry?
395,NEIL,395,"Uh, to communicate."
396,KEATING,396,"No! To woo women. Today we're going to
be talking about William Shakespeare."
397,BOY,397,"Oh, God!"
398,KEATING,398,"I know. A lot of you looked forward to
this about as much as you look forward
to root canal work. We're gonna talk
about Shakespeare as someone who writes
something very interesting. Now, many of
you have seen Shakespeare done very much
like this:"
399,KEATING,399,"""O Titus, bring your friend hither."" But
if any of you have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,
you know, Shakespeare can be different.
""Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
ears."" You can also imagine, maybe, John
Wayne as Macbeth going, ""Well, is this a
dagger I see before me?"""
400,KEATING,400,"""Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy
a good dog once in a while, sir. You can
have yourself a three-course meal from
one dog. Start with your canine
crudites, go to your Fido flambe for
main course and for dessert, a Pekingese
parfait. And you can pick your teeth
with a little paw."""
401,KEATING,401,Why do I stand up here? Anybody?
402,CHARLIE,402,To feel taller.
403,KEATING,403,No!
404,KEATING,404,"Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I
stand upon my desk to remind yourself
that we must constantly look at things
in a different way."
405,KEATING,405,"You see, the world looks very different
from up here. You don't believe me? Come
see for yourself. Come on. Come on!"
406,KEATING,406,"Just when you think you know something,
you have to look at it in another way.
Even though it may seem silly or wrong,
you must try! Now, when you read, don't
just consider what the author thinks.
Consider what you think."
407,KEATING,407,"Boys, you must strive to find your own
voice. Because the longer you wait to
begin, the less likely you are to find
it at all. Thoreau said, ""Most men lead
lives of quiet desperation."" Don't be
resigned to that. Break out!"
408,KEATING,408,"Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings.
Look around you."
409,KEATING,409,"There! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank
you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find
new ground. Now, in addition to your
essays, I would like you to compose a
poem of your own, an original work."
410,KEATING,410,"That's right! You have to deliver it
aloud in front of the class on Monday.
Bonne chance, gentlemen."
411,KEATING,411,"Mr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't
know that this assignment scares the
hell out of you, you mole."
412,MR. NOLAN,412,"Take a power train in two! Three! Keep
your eyes in the boat!"
413,MEEKS,413,"We got it, Pittsie. We got it! Radio
Free America!"
414,NEIL,414,I found it.
415,TODD,415,You found what?
416,NEIL,416,"What I wanna do right now. What's
really, really inside me."
417,TODD,417,"""A Midsummer Night's Dream""?"
418,NEIL,418,This is it.
419,TODD,419,What is this?
420,NEIL,420,"It's a play, dummy."
421,TODD,421,"I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have
to do with you?"
422,NEIL,422,"Right. They're putting it on at Henley
Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts!"
423,TODD,423,"Yes, so?"
424,NEIL,424,"So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna
be an actor! Ever since I can remember,
I've wanted to try this. I even tried to
go to summer stock auditions last year,
but, of course, my father wouldn't let
me. For the first time in my whole life
I know what I wanna do."
425,NEIL,425,"and for the first time I'm gonna do it
whether my father wants me to or not!
Carpe diem!"
426,TODD,426,"Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are
you gonna be in a play if your father
won't let you?"
427,NEIL,427,"First I gotta get the part, then I can
worry about that."
428,TODD,428,"Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds
out you went to an audition and didn't
even tell him?"
429,NEIL,429,"No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned,
he won't have to know about any of this."
430,TODD,430,"Well, that's impossible."
431,NEIL,431,Bullshit! Nothing's impossible.
432,TODD,432,"Well, why don't you just call him and
ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes."
433,NEIL,433,That's a laugh!
434,NEIL,434,"If I don't ask him, at least I won't
be disobeying him."
435,TODD,435,"Yeah, but if he said--"
436,NEIL,436,"Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on?"
437,NEIL,437,"I mean, I haven't even gotten the part
yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a
little while?"
438,NEIL,438,"You're coming to the meeting this
afternoon?"
439,TODD,439,I don't know. Maybe.
440,NEIL,440,"Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means
shit to you, does it, Todd?"
441,TODD,441,W-What is that supposed to mean?
442,NEIL,442,"You're in the club! Being in the club
means being stirred up by things. You
look about as stirred up as a cesspool."
443,TODD,443,So- You want me out?
444,NEIL,444,"No! I want you in, but being in means
you gotta do something. Not just say
you're in."
445,TODD,445,"Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this
concern, but I-I'm not like you. All
right? You, you, you say thing and
people listen. I'm, I'm not like that."
446,NEIL,446,Don't you think you could be?
447,TODD,447,"No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not
the point. The, the, the point is that
there's nothing you can do about it, so
you can just butt out. I can take care
of myself just fine. All right?"
448,NEIL,448,No.
449,TODD,449,"What do you mean, ""no""?"
450,NEIL,450,No.
451,TODD,451,"Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back."

or game is inherently better than
another. For me, sport is actually a
chance for us to have other human beings

over here and take a slip of paper and

460,KEATING,460,"Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth.

effort. It touched on one of the major

poetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were
laughing. You're up."

the first poem to ever have a negative
score on the Pritchard scale. We're not
laughing at you, we're laughing near
you. I don't mind that your poem had a
simple theme. Sometimes the most
beautiful poetry can be about simple
things, like a cat, or a flower or rain.
You see, poetry can come from anything
with the stuff of revelation in it. Just
don't let your poems be ordinary. Now,
who's next?"

agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put

526,KEATING,526,Yes?
527,TODD,527,"Uh, and this image floats beside me."
528,KEATING,528,A sweaty-toothed madman?
529,TODD,529,"A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare
that pounds my brain."
530,KEATING,530,"Oh, that's excellent. Now, give him
action. Make him do something."
531,TODD,531,H-His hands reach out and choke me.
532,KEATING,532,That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.
533,TODD,533,"And, and all the time he's mumbling."
534,KEATING,534,What's he mumbling?
535,TODD,535,"M-Mumbling, ""Truth. Truth is like, like
a blanket that always leaves your feet
cold."""
536,KEATING,536,"Forget them, forget them. Stay with the
blanket. Tell me about that blanket."
537,TODD,537,"Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll
never be enough. You kick at it, beat
it, it'll never cover any of us. From
the moment we enter crying to the moment
we leave dying, it will just cover your
face as you wail and cry and scream."
538,KEATING,538,Don't you forget this.
539,CHARLIE,539,"Attaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply."
540,MEEKS,540,My dad collects a lot of pipes.
541,CHARLIE,541,Really? Mine's got thirty.
542,PITTS,542,"Your parents collect pipes? Oh, that's
really interesting."
543,CHARLIE,543,"Come on, Knox. Join in."
544,MEEKS,544,"Yeah, Knox, we're from the government.
We're here to help, man."
545,CHARLIE,545,What's wrong?
546,PITTS,546,"It's Chris. Here's a picture of Chris
for you."
547,MEEKS,547,"Smoke that. Put that in your pipe and
smoke it."
548,KNOX,548,That's not funny.
549,CHARLIE,549,Knock it off. Smoke your pipes.
550,MEEKS,550,Neil!
551,NEIL,551,"Friend, scholar, Welton men."
552,MEEKS,552,"What is that, Neil?"
553,PITTS,553,"Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks."
554,NEIL,554,No. This is the god of the cave.
555,MEEKS,555,The god of the cave.
556,PITTS,556,"Charlie, what are you doing?"
557,CHARLIE,557,What do you say we start this meeting?
558,BOY 1,558,"Y-Yeah, just-- I need a light. I just
gotta-"
559,BOY 2,559,Got my earplugs?
560,CHARLIE,560,"Gentlemen, ""Poetrusic"" by Charles
Dalton."
561,MEEKS,561,"Oh, no."
562,CHARLIE,562,"Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling.
Gotta do more. Gotta be more."
563,CHARLIE,563,"Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta
do more! Gotta be more!"
564,MEEKS,564,Wow!
565,PITTS,565,"That was nice. That was great. Where did
you learn to play like that?"
566,CHARLIE,566,"My parents made me take the clarinet for
years."
567,CAMERON,567,I love the clarinet.
568,CHARLIE,568,"I hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone
is more sonorous."
569,CAMERON,569,Ooh.
570,MEEKS,570,Vocabulary.
571,KNOX,571,"I can't take it anymore. If I don't have
Chris, I'm gonna kill myself."
572,CHARLIE,572,"Knoxious, you've gotta calm down."
573,KNOX,573,"No, Charlie. That's just my problem.
I've been calm all my life. I'll do
something about that."
574,NEIL,574,Where are you going?
575,CHARLIE,575,What are you gonna do?
576,KNOX,576,I'm gonna call her.
577,CHRIS (O.S.),577,Hello?
578,KNOX,578,"She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will
hate me. My parents will kill me.
All right, goddamn it. You're right.
""Carpe diem."" Even if it kills me."
579,CHRIS (O.S.),579,Hello?
580,KNOX,580,"Hello, Chris?"
581,CHRIS (O.S.),581,Yes.
582,KNOX,582,Hi. This is Knox Overstreet.
583,CHRIS (O.S.),583,"Oh, yes. Knox. Glad you called."
584,KNOX,584,She's glad I called.
585,CHRIS (O.S.),585,"Listen, Chet's parents are going out of
town this weekend, so he's having a
party. Would you like to come?"
586,KNOX,586,Would I like to come to a party?
587,CHARLIE,587,"Yes. Say, yes."
588,CHRIS (O.S.),588,Friday? Um-
589,KNOX,589,"Well, sure."
590,CHRIS (O.S.),590,About seven?
591,KNOX,591,"Okay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris."
592,CHRIS (O.S.),592,Okay.
593,KNOX,593,"Friday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay.
Thank you."
594,CHRIS (O.S.),594,Okay. Bye.
595,KNOX,595,Thank you. I'll see you. Bye.
596,KNOX,596,"Yawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna
call me. She invited me to a party with
her."
597,CHARLIE,597,At Chet Danburry's house.
598,KNOX,598,Yeah.
599,CHARLIE,599,Well?
600,KNOX,600,So?
601,CHARLIE,601,"So, you don't really think she means
you're going with her?"
602,KNOX,602,"Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's
not the point. That's not the point at
all."
603,CHARLIE,603,What is the point?
604,KNOX,604,"The point, Charlie, is, uh--"
605,CHARLIE,605,Yeah?
606,KNOX,606,"that she was thinking about me. I've
only met her once, and already she's
thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna
happen, guys. I feel it. She is going to
be mine. Carpe. Carpe!"
607,KEATING,607,"No grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take
a stroll."
608,KEATING,608,There it is.
609,KEATING,609,"I don't know, but I've been told--"
610,BOYS,610,"I don't know, but I've been told--"
611,KEATING,611,Doing poetry is old--
612,BOYS,612,Doing poetry is old--
613,KEATING,613,"Left, left, left-right-left. Left, left,
left-right-left. Left, halt!"
614,KEATING,614,"Thank you, gentlemen. If you noticed,
everyone started off with their own
stride, their own pace."
615,KEATING,615,"Mr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll
get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could
see him thinking, ""Is this right? It might
be right. It might be right. I know that.
Maybe not. I don't know."""
616,KEATING,616,"Mr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force.
Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I
didn't bring them up here to ridicule
them. I brought them up here to illustrate
the point of conformity: the difficulty in
maintaining your own beliefs in the face
of others. Now, those of you -- I see
the look in your eyes like, ""I would've
walked differently."" Well, ask
yourselves why you were clapping. Now,
we all have a great need for acceptance.
But you must trust that your beliefs are
unique, your own, even though others may
think them odd or unpopular, even though
the herd may go, ""That's baaaaad."" Robert
Frost said, ""Two roads diverged in a
wood and I, I took the one less traveled
by, and that has made all the
difference."" Now, I want you to find
your own walk right now. Your own way of
striding, pacing. Any direction.
Anything you want. Whether it's proud,
whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen,
the courtyard is yours."
617,KEATING,617,"You don't have to perform. Just make it
for yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining
us?"
618,CHARLIE,618,Exercising the right not to walk.
619,KEATING,619,"Thank you, Mr. Dalton. You just
illustrated the point. Swim against the
stream."
620,NEIL,620,Todd? Hey.
621,TODD,621,Hey.
622,NEIL,622,What's going on?
623,TODD,623,Nothing. Today's my birthday.
624,NEIL,624,Is today your birthday? Happy birthday.
625,TODD,625,Thanks.
626,NEIL,626,What's you get?
627,TODD,627,My parents gave me this.
628,NEIL,628,Isn't this the same desk set-
629,TODD,629,"Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing
as last year."
630,NEIL,630,Oh.
631,TODD,631,Oh.
632,NEIL,632,"Maybe they thought you needed another
one."
633,TODD,633,"Maybe they weren't thinking about
anything at all. Uh, the funny thing is
about this is I, I didn't even like it
the first time."
634,NEIL,634,"Todd, I think you're underestimating the
value of this desk set."
635,NEIL,635,"I mean, who would want a football or
a baseball, or-"
636,TODD,636,Or a car.
637,NEIL,637,"Or a car if they could have a desk set
as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if
I were ever going to buy a, a desk set
twice, I would probably buy this one
both times. In fact, its, its shape is,
it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can
feel it. This desk set wants to fly."
638,NEIL,638,"Todd? The world's first unmanned flying
desk set."
639,TODD,639,"Oh, my!"
640,NEIL,640,"Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get
another one next year."
641,BOYS,641,"""To live deep and suck out all the
marrow of life. To put to rout all that
was not life"""
642,CAMERON,642,"Oh, my God!"
643,GLORIA,643,Is this it?
644,CHARLIE,644,"Yeah, this is it. Go ahead, go on in.
It's my cave. Watch your step."
645,TINA,645,"We're not gonna slip, are we?"
646,GLORIA,646,Uh-oh.
647,GLORIA,647,Hi.
648,MEEKS,648,Hello.
649,GLORIA,649,Hello.
650,CHARLIE,650,"Hi, you guys. Meet, uh, Gloria and--"
651,TINA,651,Tina.
652,CHARLIE,652,"Tina. This is the pledge class of the
Dead Poets Society."
653,BOYS,653,Hello. How do you do?
654,NEIL,654,Hello.
655,GLORIA,655,Hi. Hi.
656,CHARLIE,656,"Guys, move. Move. Come on, folks. It's
Friday night. Let's get on with the
meeting."
657,BOYS,657,Sorry. Excuse- Excuse me.
658,CHARLIE,658,"Guys, I have an announcement to make. In
keeping with the spirit of passionate
experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm
giving up the name Charlie Dalton. From
now on, call me Nuwanda."
659,"PITTS
(laughing)",659,Nuwanda?
660,NEIL,660,Nuwanda?
661,KNOX,661,"Hello? Hello, Chris?"
662,CHRIS,662,Knox!
663,KNOX,663,Hi.
664,CHRIS,664,You made it. Great! Bring anybody?
665,KNOX,665,No.
666,CHRIS,666,"No. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have
to go find Chet. Why don't you go
downstairs where everybody is?"
667,CHRIS,667,Make yourself at home.
668,KNOX,668,But I--
669,STEVE,669,"Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother? Bubba,
this guy look like Mutt Sanders to you
or what?"
670,BUBBA,670,You're his brother?
671,KNOX,671,"No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry,
guys."
672,BUBBA,672,"Where's your manners Steve? Mutt Sanders'
brother, we don't even offer him a
drink. Here. Go have some whiskey, pal."
673,STEVE,673,Yeah.
674,KNOX,674,"Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink--"
675,BUBBA,675,To Mutt.
676,STEVE,676,To Mutt.
677,KNOX,677,To Mutt.
678,BUBBA,678,"Now, how the hell is old Mutt, anyway?"
679,STEVE,679,"Yeah. What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh?"
680,KNOX,680,I don't really know Mutt.
681,BUBBA,681,To Mighty Mutt.
682,GUY 1,682,To Mighty Mutt.
683,KNOX,683,To Mighty Mutt.
684,BUBBA,684,"Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy. Say
hello to Mutt for me, okay?"
685,KNOX,685,Will do.
686,STEVE,686,"Yeah. Hell of a guy, your brother Mutt."
687,CHARLIE,687,We gonna have a meeting or what?
688,GLORIA,688,"Yeah. If you guys don't have a meeting,
how do we know if we wanna join?"
689,NEIL,689,Join?
690,CHARLIE,690,"""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more
temperate."""
691,TINA,691,That's so sweet.
692,CHARLIE,692,I made that up just for you.
693,TINA,693,You did?
694,CHARLIE,694,"I'll write one for you too, Gloria.
She walks in beauty like the night.
She walks in beauty like the night.
Of cloudless climes and starry skies.
All that's best, dark and bright,
Meet in her aspect and her eyes."
695,GLORIA,695,That's beautiful.
696,CHARLIE,696,"There's plenty more where that came
from."
697,KNOX,697,God help me.
698,KNOX,698,Carpe diem.
699,BUBBA,699,Chet! Chet! Look!
700,CHET,700,What?
701,BUBBA,701,It's Mutt Sanders' brother.
702,CHET,702,Huh?
703,CHRIS,703,"Knox, what--"
704,BUBBA,704,And he's feeling up your girl!
705,CHRIS,705,What are you doing?
706,CHET,706,What the hell are you doing?
707,CHRIS,707,"Chet! Chet, don't."
708,KNOX,708,"Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but
you've gotta-"
709,CHRIS,709,"Chet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop
it! Leave him alone!"
710,CHET,710,Goddamn!
711,CHRIS,711,"Chet, stop it!"
712,CHET,712,Bastard!
713,CHRIS,713,"Knox, are you all right?"
714,CHET,714,"Chris, get the hell away from him!"
715,CHRIS,715,"Chet, you hurt him!"
716,CHET,716,Good!
717,KNOX,717,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
718,CHRIS,718,It's okay. It-It's okay.
719,CHET,719,"Next time I see you, you die."
720,TINA,720,"Go ahead, pass it around."
721,MEEKS,721,"Me and Pitts are working on a hi-fi
system. It shouldn't be that hard to,
uh, to put together."
722,PITTS,722,"Yeah. Uh, I might be going to Yale. Uh,
uh, but, I, I might not."
723,GLORIA,723,"Don't you guys miss having girls around
here?"
724,MEEKS AND PITTS,724,Yeah.
725,CHARLIE,725,"That's part of what this club is about.
In fact, I'd like to announce I
published an article in the school
paper, in the name of the Dead Poets."
726,CAMERON,726,What?
727,CHARLIE,727,Demanding girls be admitted to Welton.
728,PITTS,728,You didn't.
729,CHARLIE,729,So we can all stop beating off.
730,NEIL,730,How did you do that?
731,CHARLIE,731,"I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the
article in."
732,MEEKS,732,"Look, uh, it's, it's over now."
733,CHARLIE,733,Why? Nobody knows who we are.
734,CAMERON,734,"Well, don't you think they're gonna
figure out who wrote it? They're gonna
come to you and ask to know what the
Dead Poets Society is. Charlie, you had
no right to do something like that."
735,CHARLIE,735,"It's Nuwanda, Cameron."
736,GLORIA,736,That's right. It's Nuwanda.
737,CHARLIE,737,"Are we just playing around out here, or
do we mean what we say? For all we do is
come together and reach a bunch of poems
to each other. What the hell are we
doing?"
738,NEIL,738,"All right, but you still shouldn't have
done it, Charlie. This could mean
trouble. You don't speak for the club."
739,CHARLIE,739,"Hey, would you not worry about your
precious little neck? If they catch me,
I'll tell them I made it up."
740,MR. NOLAN,740,Sit.
741,MR. NOLAN,741,"In this week of Welton's Honor there
appeared a profane and unauthorized
article. Rather than spend my valuable
time ferreting out the guilty persons --
and let me assure you I will find them -
- I'm asking any and all students who
knows anything about this article to
make themselves known here and now.
Whoever the guilty persons are, this is
your only chance to avoid expulsion from
this school."
742,CHARLIE,742,"Welton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just
a moment."
743,CHARLIE,743,"Mr. Nolan, it's for you. It's
God. He says we should have girls at
Welton."
744,MR. NOLAN,744,"Wipe that smirk off your face. If you
think, Mr. Dalton, that you're the first
to try to get thrown out of this school,
think again. Others have had similar
notions and have failed just as surely
as you will fail. Assume the position."
745,MR. NOLAN,745,"Count aloud, Mr. Dalton."
746,CHARLIE,746,One. Two. Three. Four. Five.
747,MR. NOLAN,747,"What is this Dead Poets Society? I want
names."
748,NEIL,748,You kicked out?
749,CHARLIE,749,No.
750,NEIL,750,So what happened?
751,CHARLIE,751,"I'm to turn everybody in, apologize to
the school and all will be forgiven."
752,NEIL,752,"So, what are you gonna do? Charlie!"
753,CHARLIE,753,"Damn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda."
754,MR. NOLAN,754,"Excuse me. May we have a word, Mr.
Keating?"
755,KEATING,755,Certainly.
756,MR. NOLAN,756,"This was my first classroom, John. Did
you know that? My first desk."
757,KEATING,757,"Didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan."
758,MR. NOLAN,758,"English. Oh, long before your time. It
was hard giving it up, I can tell you.
I'm hearing rumors, John, about some
unorthodox teaching methods in your
classroom. I'm not saying they've
anything to do with the Dalton boy's
outburst. But I don't think I have to
warn you boys his age are very
impressionable."
759,KEATING,759,"Well, your reprimand made quite an
impression, I'm sure."
760,MR. NOLAN,760,"What was going on in the courtyard the
other day?"
761,KEATING,761,Courtyard?
762,MR. NOLAN,762,"Yeah. Boys marching, clapping in unison."
763,KEATING,763,"Oh, that. That was an exercise to prove
a point. Dangers of conformity."
764,MR. NOLAN,764,"Well, John, the curriculum here is set.
It's proven it works. If you question,
what's to prevent them from doing the
same?"
765,KEATING,765,"I always thought the idea of educating
was to learn to think for yourself."
766,MR. NOLAN,766,"At these boys' ages? Not on your life!
Tradition, John. Discipline. Prepare
them for college, and the rest will take
care of itself."
767,CHARLIE,767,"Creak. He started walking around towards
my left. Creak. Creak. ""Assume the
position, Mr. Dalton."""
768,KEATING,768,"It's all right, gentlemen."
769,CHARLIE,769,Mr. Keating.
770,KEATING,770,"Mr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt
you pulled today."
771,CHARLIE,771,"You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about
Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow
out of life and all that?"
772,KEATING,772,"Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't
mean choking on the bone. Sure there's a
time for daring and there's a time for
caution, and a wise man understands
which is called for."
773,CHARLIE,773,But I thought you'd like that.
774,KEATING,774,"No. You being expelled from school is
not daring to me. It's stupid, 'cause
you'll miss some golden opportunities."
775,CHARLIE,775,Yeah. Like what?
776,KEATING,776,"Like, if nothing else, the opportunity
to attend my classes. Got it, Ace?"
777,CHARLIE,777,"Aye, aye, Captain."
778,KEATING,778,"Keep your head about you. That goes for
the lot of you."
779,BOYS,779,"Yes, Captain."
780,KEATING,780,"Phone call from God. If it had been
collect, it wouldn't been daring."
781,CHARLIE,781,All right. Go on.
782,DIRECTOR,782,"We're trying to rehearse, okay? Start."
783,LYSANDER,783,"A good persuasion, therefore hear me,
Hermia."
784,DIRECTOR,784,"Wait, please. Excitement. I don't hear
any excitement about this play. And take
her hand. Bring her down the stage and
stop. And ""There, gentle Hermia."" Okay?
Try again."
785,BOY,785,What's for dinner?
786,PITTS,786,Spaghetti and meatballs!
787,NEIL,787,"Save some for me. ""But, room, Fairy!
Here comes Oberon."""
788,NEIL,788,Father.
789,MR. PERRY,789,Neil.
790,NEIL,790,"Wait a minute. Before you say anything,
please let me ex-"
791,MR. PERRY,791,"Don't you dare talk back to me! It's bad
enough that you've wasted your time with
this, this absurd acting business. But
you deliberately deceived me! How, how,
how did you expect to get away with
this? Answer me. Who put you up to it?
Was it this new man? This, uh, Mr.
Keating?"
792,NEIL,792,"No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you.
I've gotten all A's in every class."
793,MR. PERRY,793,"Did you think I wasn't going to find
out? ""Oh, my niece is in a play with
your son,"" says Mrs. Marks. ""No, no,
no,"" I say, ""you must be mistaken. My
son's not in a play."" You made me a liar
of me, Neil! Now, tomorrow you go to
them and you tell them that you're
quitting."
794,NEIL,794,"No, I can't. I have the main part. The
performance is tomorrow night."
795,MR. PERRY,795,"I don't care if the world comes to an
end tomorrow night. You are through with
that play. Is that clear? Is that clear?"
796,NEIL,796,"Yes, sir."
797,MR. PERRY,797,"I made a great many sacrifices to get
you here, Neil, and you will not let me
down."
798,NEIL,798,"No, sir."
799,KEATING,799,It's open.
800,KEATING,800,"Neil, what's up?"
801,NEIL,801,Can I speak to you a minute?
802,KEATING,802,Certainly. Sit down.
803,NEIL,803,I'm sorry. Here.
804,KEATING,804,Excuse me. Get you some tea?
805,NEIL,805,Tea. Sure.
806,KEATING,806,Like some milk or sugar in that?
807,NEIL,807,"No, thanks."
808,NEIL,808,"Gosh, they don't give you much room
around here."
809,KEATING,809,"No, it's part of the monastic oath. They
don't want worldly things distracting me
from my teaching."
810,NEIL,810,She's pretty.
811,KEATING,811,"She's also in London. Makes it a little
difficult."
812,NEIL,812,How can you stand it?
813,KEATING,813,Stand what?
814,NEIL,814,"You can go anywhere. You can do
anything. How can you stand being here?"
815,KEATING,815,"'Cause I love teaching. I don't wanna be
anywhere else."
816,KEATING,816,What's up?
817,NEIL,817,"I just talked to my father. He's making
me quit the play at Henley Hall.
Acting's everything to me. I-- But he
doesn't know. He-- I can see his point.
We're not a rich family like Charlie's,
and we-- But he's planning the rest of
my life for me, and I-- H-He's never
asked me what I want."
818,KEATING,818,"Have you ever told your father what you
just told me? About your passion for
acting. You ever show him that?"
819,NEIL,819,I can't.
820,KEATING,820,Why not?
821,NEIL,821,I can't talk to him this way.
822,KEATING,822,"Then you're acting for him, too. You're
playing the part of the dutiful son. I
know this sounds impossible, but you
have to talk to him. You have to show
him who you are, what your heart is."
823,NEIL,823,"I know what he'll say. He'll tell me
that acting's a whim, and I should
forget it. That how they're counting on
me. He'll just tell me to put it out of
my mind, ""for my own good."""
824,KEATING,824,"You are not an indentured servant. If
it's not a whim for you, you prove it to
him by your conviction and your passion.
You show him that And if he still
doesn't believe you, well, by then
you'll be out of school and you can do
anything you want."
825,NEIL,825,"No. What about the play? The show's
tomorrow night."
826,KEATING,826,"Well, you have to talk to him before
tomorrow night."
827,NEIL,827,Isn't there an easier way?
828,KEATING,828,No.
829,NEIL,829,I'm trapped.
830,KEATING,830,"No, you're not."
831,KNOX,831,Chris!
832,KNOX,832,Chris Noel. Do you know where she is?
833,GIRL,833,"Um, I think she's in room 111."
834,KNOX,834,Thanks.
835,KNOX,835,Excuse me. Chris.
836,CHRIS,836,"Knox, what are you doing here?"
837,KNOX,837,"I came to apologize for the other night.
I brought you these and a poem I wrote
for you."
838,CHRIS,838,"Knox, don't you know that, if Chet finds
you here he'll kill you?"
839,KNOX,839,"I can't care. I love you, Chris."
840,CHRIS,840,"Knox, you're crazy."
841,KNOX,841,"Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it.
Please, accept these. Please."
842,CHRIS,842,"No. No-- I, I can't. Forget it."
843,CHRIS,843,"Knox, I don't believe this."
844,KNOX,844,All I'm asking you to do is listen.
845,KNOX,845,"The heavens made a girl named Chris
With hair and skin of gold.
To touch her would be paradise."
846,CHARLIE,846,"Get out of here. Cameron, you fool."
847,CHARLIE,847,"Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to
her?"
848,KNOX,848,Yeah.
849,PITTS,849,What'd she say?
850,KNOX,850,Nothing.
851,CHARLIE,851,"Nothing. What do you mean, nothing?"
852,KNOX,852,Nothing. But I did it.
853,CHARLIE,853,"What did she say? I know she had to say
something."
854,PITTS,854,"Come here, Knox."
855,KNOX,855,Seize the day!
856,KEATING,856,Did you talk to your father?
857,NEIL,857,"Uh, he didn't like it one bit, but at
least he's letting me stay in the play.
He won't be able to make, make it. He's
in Chicago. But, uh, I think he's gonna
let me stay with acting."
858,KEATING,858,Really? You told him what you told me?
859,NEIL,859,"Yeah. He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone
at least four days. I don't think he'll
make the show, but I think he'll let me
stay with it. ""Keep up the school work.""
Thanks."
860,PITTS,860,Beautiful baby.
861,MEEKS,861,"Beautiful baby. Henley Hall, here I
come."
862,CAMERON,862,"Excuse me, just a moment. Yes. You're so
cute."
863,CAMERON,863,"Come on, Todd. I'm trying to fix
this."
864,TODD,864,"Come on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss
Neil's entrance."
865,PITTS,865,"He said something about getting red
before we left."
866,CAMERON,866,Getting red? What does that mean?
867,PITTS,867,"I, uh-- Well, you know Charlie."
868,CAMERON,868,"So, Charlie, what's this ""getting red""
bit?"
869,TODD,869,W-What is that?
870,CHARLIE,870,"It's an Indian warrior symbol for
virility. Makes me feel potent, like it
can drive girls crazy."
871,TODD,871,"Oh, come on, Charlie. The girls are
waiting."
872,KNOX,872,Chris.
873,KNOX,873,What are you doing here?
874,KEATING (O.S.),874,"Gentlemen, let's go."
875,KNOX,875,"Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up."
876,CHARLIE,876,"Yeah, come on, guys."
877,KNOX,877,"Chris, you can't be in here. I-If they
catch you, we're both gonna be in big
trouble."
878,CHRIS,878,"Oh, but it's fine--"
879,CHRIS,879,"It's fine for you to come barging into
my school and make a complete fool out
of me?"
880,KNOX,880,I didn't mean to make a fool out of you.
881,CHRIS,881,"Well, you did. Chet found out. And it
took everything I could do to keep him
from coming here and killing you. Knox,
you have got to stop this stuff."
882,KNOX,882,"I can't, Chris. I love you."
883,CHRIS,883,"Knox, you say that over and over. You
don't, you don't even know me."
884,KEATING,884,"Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?"
885,KNOX,885,"Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk."
886,CHRIS,886,"Knox, Knox, it just so happens that I
could care less about you?"
887,KNOX,887,"Then you wouldn't be here warning me
about Chet."
888,CHRIS,888,"I have to go. I'm gonna be late for the
play."
889,KNOX,889,Are you going with him?
890,CHRIS,890,Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?
891,KNOX,891,Then come with me.
892,CHRIS,892,"Knox, you are so infuriating."
893,KNOX,893,"Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance.
If you don't like me after tonight, I'll
stay away forever."
894,CHRIS,894,Uh-huh.
895,KNOX,895,"I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come
with me tonight. And then, if you don't
want to see me again, I swear I'll bow
out."
896,CHRIS,896,"You know what would happen if Chet found
out?"
897,KNOX,897,"He won't know anything. We'll sit in the
back and sneak away as soon as it's
over."
898,CHRIS,898,"And I suppose you would promise that
this would be the end of it."
899,KNOX,899,Dead Poets Honor.
900,CHRIS,900,What is that?
901,KNOX,901,My word.
902,CHRIS,902,You are so infuriating.
903,CHARLIE,903,"Hey, there he is! Hey, hey."
904,KEATING,904,"Shh, boys."
905,FAIRY,905,"Either I mistake your shape and making
quite,
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish
sprite
Call'd Robin Goodfellow:"
906,PUCK,906,Thou speak'st aright;
907,PUCK,907,"I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,"
908,PUCK,908,"Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
In very likeness of a roasted crab,
And when she drinks, against her lips I
bob
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest
tale,"
909,CHARLIE,909,He's good. He's really good.
910,PUCK,910,"Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh
me;
Then slip I from her bum, down topples
she,
And ""tailor"" cries, and falls into a
cough;
And then the whole quire hold their hips
and laugh,
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and
swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
But, room, Fairy! here comes Oberon."
911,FAIRY,911,"And here my mistress. Would that he were
gone!"
912,LYSANDER,912,"Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie"
913,HERMIA,913,"Lysander riddles very prettily:
Now much beshrew my manners and my
pride,
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
But, gentle friend, for love and
courtesy
Lie further off; in human modesty,
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
and, good night, sweet friend:
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life
end!"
914,LYSANDER,914,"Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;"
915,DIRECTOR,915,"Neil. That's your cue, Neil. Come on,
Neil. Here's your crown. Let's go."
916,PUCK,916,"If we shadows have offended,"
917,PUCK,917,"Think but this, and all is mended,
That you have but slumber'd here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend:
If you pardon, we will mend:
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearned luck
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
We will make amends ere long;
Else the Puck a liar call;
So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends."
918,BOYS,918,Yawp!
919,KNOX,919,"Yeah, Neil!"
920,MR. PERRY,920,"Excuse me, I'm Neil's father. I need to
see him."
921,WOMAN,921,"Neil, Your father. He's-"
922,ACTOR,922,What did you think?
923,WOMAN,923,"Really I thought you were all just
wonderful!"
924,MR. PERRY,924,Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
925,CHARLIE,925,"Neil, Neil, you were great."
926,NEIL,926,"I can't, guys."
927,TODD,927,Neil! Neil!
928,KEATING,928,"Neil. Neil. You have the gift. What a
performance You left even me speechless.
You have to stay with-"
929,MR. PERRY,929,"Get in the car. Keating, you stay away
from my son."
930,CHARLIE,930,"Neil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on."
931,KEATING,931,Don't make it any worse than it is.
932,CHARLIE,932,Is it okay if we walk back? Captain?
933,CHARLIE,933,Knox.
934,MR. PERRY,934,"We're trying very hard to understand why
it is that you insist on defying us.
Whatever the reason, we're not gonna let
you ruin your life. Tomorrow I'm
withdrawing you from Welton and
enrolling you in Braden Military School.
You're going to Harvard and you're gonna
be a doctor."
935,NEIL,935,"But that's ten more years. Father,
that's a lifetime!"
936,MR. PERRY,936,"Oh, stop it. Don't be so dramatic. You
make it sound like a prison term. You
don't understand, Neil. You have
opportunities that I never even dreamt
of and I am not going to let you waste
them."
937,NEIL,937,I've got to tell you what I feel.
938,MRS. PERRY,938,We've been so worried about--
939,MR. PERRY,939,"What? What? Tell me what you feel. What
is it?"
940,MR. PERRY,940,"Is it more of this, this acting
business? Because you can forget that.
What?"
941,NEIL,941,Nothing.
942,MR. PERRY,942,"Nothing? Well, then, let's go to bed."
943,NEIL,943,I was good. I was really good.
944,MRS. PERRY,944,"Go on, get some sleep."
945,MR. PERRY,945,"It's all right. It's going to be all
right."
946,MR. PERRY,946,What was that?
947,MRS. PERRY,947,What?
948,MR. PERRY,948,That sound.
949,MRS. PERRY,949,What sound? Tom?
950,MRS. PERRY,950,What is it? What's wrong?
951,MR. PERRY,951,Neil.
952,MRS. PERRY,952,"Tom, what is it? What's wrong? Neil?"
953,MR. PERRY,953,Neil?
954,MRS. PERRY,954,I'll look outside. Neil?
955,MR. PERRY,955,No!
956,MR. PERRY,956,"Oh, Neil! Oh, my God!"
957,MRS. PERRY,957,Oh! No!
958,MR. PERRY,958,"Oh, my son!"
959,MRS. PERRY,959,He's all right.
960,MR. PERRY,960,My son! My poor son!
961,MRS. PERRY,961,"He's all right! He's all right! He's all
right! He's all right! He's all right!
He's all right!"
962,MR. PERRY,962,Stop it! Stop it! Stop it.
963,CHARLIE,963,Todd? Todd.
964,TODD,964,"Oh, Charlie."
965,TODD,965,What is it?
966,CHARLIE,966,Neil's dead.
967,TODD,967,It's so beautiful.
968,CHARLIE,968,"Todd. It's okay, Todd."
969,PITTS,969,Calm down.
970,CHARLIE,970,"It's all right, Todd."
971,PITTS,971,"Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd."
972,CHARLIE,972,It's all right. It's alright.
973,TODD,973,He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it.
974,MEEKS,974,"You can't explain it, Todd."
975,TODD,975,It was his father!
976,CHARLIE,976,No!
977,TODD,977,"He wouldn't have left us. It's because he-
He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his
father did it."
978,CHARLIE,978,Todd.
979,TODD,979,His father killed him. He made him do it.
980,MEEKS,980,"You can't explain it, Todd."
981,MEEKS,981,Todd!
982,CHARLIE,982,Leave him be.
983,BOYS,983,"All my life
Thy light shall surely follow me
And in God's house forevermore
My dwelling place shall be
Amen."
984,MR. NOLAN,984,"The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He
was a fine student. One of Welton's
best. And he will be missed. We've
contacted each of your parents to
explain the situation. Naturally,
they're all quite concerned. At the
request of Neil's family, I intend to
conduct a thorough inquiry into this
matter. Your complete cooperation is
expected."
985,CHARLIE,985,You told him about this meeting?
986,PITTS,986,Twice.
987,CHARLIE,987,"That's it, guys. We're all fried."
988,PITTS,988,How do you mean?
989,CHARLIE,989,"Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office
right now, finking."
990,PITTS,990,About what?
991,CHARLIE,991,"The club, Pittsie. Think about it. The
board of directors, the trustees and Mr.
Nolan. Do you think for one moment
they're gonna let this thing just blow
over? Schools go down because of things
like this. They need a scapegoat."
992,CAMERON,992,"What's going on, guys?"
993,CHARLIE,993,"You finked, didn't you, Cameron?"
994,CAMERON,994,"Finked? I didn't know what the hell
you're talking about."
995,CHARLIE,995,"You told Nolan everything about the club
is what I'm talking about."
996,CAMERON,996,"Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton,
there's something called an honor code
at this school, all right? If a teacher
asks you a question, you tell the truth
or you're expelled."
997,CHARLIE,997,You little-
998,MEEKS,998,Charlie!
999,CHARLIE,999,"He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes,
so he rattled to save himself."
1000,KNOX,1000,"Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and
you're out."
1001,CHARLIE,1001,I'm out anyway!
1002,KNOX,1002,"You don't know that, not yet."
1003,CAMERON,1003,"He's right there, Charlie. And if you
guys are smart, you will do exactly what
I did and cooperate. They're not after
us. We're the victims. Us and Neil."
1004,CHARLIE,1004,What's that mean? Who are they after?
1005,CAMERON,1005,"Why, Mr. Keating, of course. The
""Captain"" himself. I mean, you guys
didn't really think he could avoid
responsibility, did you?"
1006,CHARLIE,1006,"Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is
that what they're saying?"
1007,CAMERON,1007,"Well, who else do you think, dumb ass?
The administration? Mr. Perry? Mr.
Keating put us up to all this crap,
didn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating,
Neil would be cozied up in his room
right now, studying his chemistry and
dreaming of being called doctor."
1008,TODD,1008,"That is not true, Cameron. You know
that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil
loved acting."
1009,CAMERON,1009,"Believe what you want, but I say let
Keating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives?"
1010,CAMERON,1010,"You just signed your expulsion papers,
Nuwanda."
1011,CAMERON,1011,"And if the rest of you are smart, you'll
do exactly what I did. They know
everything anyway. You can't save
Keating, but you can save yourselves."
1012,HAGER,1012,Knox Overstreet.
1013,TODD,1013,Meeks?
1014,MEEKS,1014,Go away. I have to study.
1015,TODD,1015,What happened to Nuwanda?
1016,MEEKS,1016,Expelled.
1017,TODD,1017,What'd you tell 'em?
1018,MEEKS,1018,Nothing they didn't already know.
1019,HAGER (O.S.),1019,Todd Anderson.
1020,MR. ANDERSON,1020,"Hello, son."
1021,MRS. ANDERSON,1021,"Hello, darling."
1022,TODD,1022,Mom.
1023,MR. NOLAN,1023,"Have a seat, Mr. Anderson."
1024,MR. NOLAN,1024,"Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well
put together what's happened here. You
do admit to being a part of this Dead
Poets Society?"
1025,MR. ANDERSON,1025,"Answer him, Todd."
1026,TODD,1026,"Yes, sir."
1027,MR. NOLAN,1027,"I have here a detailed description of
what occurred at your meetings. It
describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating,
encouraged you boys to organize this
club and to use it as a source of
inspiration for reckless and self-
indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr.
Keating, both in and out of the
classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to
follow his obsession with acting when he
knew all along it was against the
explicit order of Neil's parents. It was
Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his
position as teacher that led directly to
Neil Perry's death."
1028,MR. NOLAN,1028,"Read that document carefully, Todd. Very
carefully."
1029,MR. NOLAN,1029,"If you've nothing to add or amend, sign
it."
1030,TODD,1030,What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating?
1031,MR. ANDERSON,1031,"I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd."
1032,McALLISTER,1032,"Grass is gramen or herba. Lapis is
stone. The entire building is
aedificium."
1033,MR. NOLAN,1033,Sit.
1034,MR. NOLAN,1034,"I'll be teaching this class through
exams. We'll find a permanent English
teacher during the break. Who will tell
me where you are in the Pritchard
textbook?"
1035,MR. NOLAN,1035,Mr. Anderson?
1036,TODD,1036,"Uh, in the, in the Pr-"
1037,MR. NOLAN,1037,"I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson."
1038,TODD,1038,"In the, in the, in the Pritchard?"
1039,MR. NOLAN,1039,"Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron."
1040,CAMERON,1040,"We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered
the Romantics and some of the chapters
on Post Civil War literature."
1041,MR. NOLAN,1041,What about the Realists?
1042,CAMERON,1042,"I believe we skipped most of that, sir."
1043,MR. NOLAN,1043,"All right, then, we'll start over. What
is poetry?"
1044,MR. NOLAN,1044,Come.
1045,KEATING,1045,"Excuse me. I came for my personals.
Should I come back after class?"
1046,MR. NOLAN,1046,"Get them now, Mr. Keating."
1047,MR. NOLAN,1047,"Gentlemen, turn to page 21 of the
introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud
the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on
""Understanding Poetry."""
1048,CAMERON,1048,"That page has been ripped out, sir."
1049,MR. NOLAN,1049,"Well, borrow somebody else's book."
1050,CAMERON,1050,"They're all ripped out, sir."
1051,MR. NOLAN,1051,"What do you mean, they're all ripped
out?"
1052,CAMERON,1052,"Sir, we, uh-"
1053,MR. NOLAN,1053,Never mind.
1054,MR. NOLAN,1054,Read!
1055,CAMERON,1055,"""Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans

1056,CAMERON,1056,"""... How important is that objective?

question 2 rates its importance. And

1057,TODD,1057,"Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign
it."
1058,MR. NOLAN,1058,"Quiet, Mr. Anderson."
