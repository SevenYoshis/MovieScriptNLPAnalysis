3,SMEAGOL (cont'd),3,Deagol!
4,SMEAGOL,4,"Give us that, Deagol, my love!"
5,DEAGOL,5,Why?
6,SMEAGOL,6,"Because its my birthday, and I wants it."
7,SMEAGOL (cont'd),7,My precious!
8,SMEAGOL V/0,8,"They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer they
called us. They cursed us and drove us
away."
9,SMEAGOL V/0 (cont'd),9,"And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so
alone. And we forgot the taste of bread,
the sound of trees, the softness of the
wind . . . We even forgot our own name."
10,SMEAGOL V/0 (cont'd),10,Gollum! Gollum!
11,GOLLUM,11,It's mine! My own. It came to me.
12,SMEAGOL,12,My Precious.
13,GOLLUM,13,"Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We
must go, yes, we must go at once!"
14,SAM,14,"Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?"
15,SAM (cont'd),15,I've gone and had too much!
16,SAM (cont'd),16,It must be getting late.
17,FRODO,17,"No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
The days are growing darker."
18,GOLLUM,18,"Come on, must go, no time ..."
19,SAM,19,Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.
20,GOLLUM,20,". . . no time to lose, silly."
21,SAM,21,Here.
22,FRODO,22,What about you?
23,SAM,23,"I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas
bread."
24,FRODO,24,Sam.
25,SAM,25,Alright. We don't have that much left.
26,SAM (cont'd),26,"We have to be careful or we're going to run
out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr Frodo.
I've rationed it. There should be enough."
27,FRODO,27,For what?
28,SAM,28,The journey home.
29,GOLLUM,29,"Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close
to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry!
Shhh."
30,PIPPIN,30,"I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon,
after a hard days work."
31,MERRY,31,"Only, you've never done a hard days work."
32,MERRY (cont'd),32,"Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard."
33,GIMLI,33,"You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led
us on, and now we find you feasting and
smoking."
34,PIPPIN,34,"We are sitting on a field of victory,
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
The salted pork is particularly good."
35,GIMLI,35,Salted pork?
36,GANDALF,36,Hobbits!
37,MERRY,37,"We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
taken over management of Isengard."
38,TREEBEARD,38,"Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
be managed here ... Locked in his tower."
39,GANDALF,39,"And there Saruman must remain, under your
guard, Treebeard."
40,GIMLI,40,"Let's just have his head and be done with
it.                            ."
41,GANDALF,41,No. He has no power any more.
42,TREEBEARD,42,"The filth of Saruman is washing away ...
Trees will come back to live here, young
trees . . . wild trees."
43,TREEBEARD,43,Well bless my bark!
44,GANDALF,44,"Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!"
45,GANDALF (cont'd),45,"Quickly, now!"
46,THEODEN,46,"Tonight we remember those who gave their
blood to defend this country. Hail the
victorious dead!"
47,EOWYN,47,Westu Aragorn hal.
48,THEODEN,48,I am happy for you.
49,THEODEN (cont'd),49,He is an honourable man.
50,EOWYN,50,You are both honourable men.
51,THEODEN,51,"It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
people to victory."
52,T HE ODE N ( co nt' d),52,"Don't listen to me - you are young, and
tonight is for you."
53,MERRY & PIPPIN,53,"Oh, you can search - up and down
As many lands as can be found
But you'll never find a beer so brown
As the one we drink in our home town
You can keep your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon
But the only brew, for the brave and true,
Comes from the Green Dragon!"
54,ARAGORN,54,No news of Frodo?
55,GANDALF,55,No word ... nothing.
56,ARAGORN,56,We till have time.
57,ARAGORN (cont'd),57,Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor.
58,GANDALF,58,Do we know that?
59,ARAGORN,59,What does your heart tell you?
60,GANDALF,60,That Frodo is alive.
61,GANDALF,61,"Yes - yes, he is alive."
62,SMEAGOL,62,"Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them
... kill them both!"
63,SME AGO L (c ont' d),63,No!
64,GOLLUM,64,Shhh! Quiet!
65,GOLLUM (cont'd),65,"Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!"
66,SMEAGOL,66,"They knows, they knows, they suspects us."
67,"GOLLUM.,               .     ,.·",67,"What is it saying,.my Precious, my love? Is .
Smeagol losing his nerve??"
68,SMEAGOL                 :,68,"No! Not! Never!! Smeagol hates nasty
Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see: them -
dead!"
69,GOLLUM,69,"And we will . . ,- Smeagol did it once. . ."
70,GOLLUM,70,. . . He can do it again.
71,GOLLUM (cont'd),71,It's ours - ours!
72,SMEAGOL,72,"We must get the Precious. We must get it
back."
73,GOLLUM,73,"Patience, patience, my love. First we must
lead them to her."
74,SMEAGOL,74,We lead them to the windy stairs.
75,GOLLUM,75,"Yes, the stairs ... and then?"
76,SMEAGOL,76,"Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until
we come to . . ."
77,SMEAGOL,77,... the Tunnel!
78,GOLLUM,78,"And when they go in, there's no coming out.
She's always hungry, she always needs to
feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy
Orcses."
79,SMEAGOL,79,"And they doesn't taste very nice, does
they, Precious?               ."
80,GOLLUM,80,"No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She
hungers for sweeter meats . . ."
81,GOLLUM (cont'd),81,"""Hobbit meat."" And when She throws away the
bones and the empty clothes, then we will
find it . . ."
82,SMEAGOL,82,And take it for Me!
83,GOLLUM,83,For us . . .
84,SMEAGOL,84,"Yes, we, we meant for us . . ."
85,SMEAGOL,85,Go Hum! Go Hum!
86,GOLLUM,86,"The Precious will be ours once the
Hobbitses are dead!"
87,SAM,87,You treacherous little toad!
88,GOLLUM,88,No! Not! Help! Master!
89,FRODO,89,"No, Sam! Leave him alone!"
90,SAM,90,"I heard it from his own mouth        he means
to murder us!"
91,SMEAGOL,91,"Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol
and who makes up nasty lies!"
92,SAM,92,"You miserable little maggot! I'll stove
your head in!"
93,FRODO,93,"Sm. . .
a"
94,SAM,94,Call me a liar! You're a liar!
95,FRODO,95,"Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost."
96,SAM,96,"I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I
won' t wait around for him to kill us !"
97,FRODO,97,I'm not sending him away.
98,SAM,98,"You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!"
99,FRODO,99,"We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not
without a guide. I need you on my side."
100,SAM,100,"I'm on your side, Mr Frodo."
101,FRODO,101,"I know, Sam, I know."
102,FRODO,102,You must trust me.
103,FRODO,103,"Come, Smeagol."
104,FRODO,104,"The stars are veiled, something stirs in
the east . . . A sleepless malice."
105,FRODO,105,The eye of the enemy is moving.
106,MERRY,106,"(whispers)
What you doing?"
107,MERRY (cont'd),107,Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?
108,MERRY (cont'd),108,"Pippin, are you mad?"
109,PIPPIN,109,"I just want to look at it. Just one more
time."
110,MERRY,110,Put it back! Put - it - back!
111,MERRY (cont'd),111,Pippin!
112,MERRY (cont'd),112,Pippin!
113,MERRY (cont'd),113,He is here.
114,MERRY,114,Help! Someone help him!
115,GANDALF,115,Fool of a Took!
116,MERRY,116,Pippin!
117,PIPPIN,117,Gandalf! Forgive me.
118,GANDALF             .,118,Look at me! What did you see?
119,PIPPIN,119,"A tree ... There was a white tree . . . in a
courtyard of stone . . . It was dead!"
120,PIPPIN (cont'd),120,The city was burning ...
121,GANDALF,121,Minas Tirith???
122,GANDALF,122,Is that what you saw?
123,PIPPIN,123,"I saw . . . I saw him . . . I could hear his
voice in my head."
124,GANDALF,124,And what did you tell him? Speak!
125,PIPPIN,125,"He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he
hurt me . . ."
126,GANDALF,126,"What did you tell him about Frodo and the
Ring?"
127,GANDALF,127,"There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,
but an honest fool he remains. He told
Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring."
128,GANDALF (cont'd),128,"We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
enemy's plan."
129,GANDALF (cont'd),129,"Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
our enemy one thing."
130,GANDALF (cont'd),130,"The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
not as weak as he supposed. There is
courage still - strength enough left to
challenge him."
131,GANDALF (cont'd),131,"Sauro n        fea   rs this. He             will no t risk            t   he

groun d        bef   ore he sees              the ret urn of           t   he
King."
132,GANDALF (cont'd),132,"If the beacons of Condor are lit, Rohan
must be ready for war!"
133,THEODEN,133,"Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?"
134,THEODEN (cont'd),134,What do we owe Gondor?
135,ARAGORN,135,I will go.
136,GANDALF,136,No!
137,ARAGORN,137,They must be warned.
138,GANDALF,138,They will be.
139,GANDALF,139,"You must come to Minas Tirith by another
ra ...
od"
140,GANDALF,140,"Follow the river, look to the black ships."
141,GANDALF,141,"Understand this . . . things are now in
motion that cannot be undone."
142,GANDALF (cont'd),142,"I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be
going alone !"
143,GANDALF,143,"Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin,
Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry!"
144,PIPPIN,144,Where are we going?
145,MERRY,145,"Why did you look - why do you always have
to look?"
146,MERRY,146,I don't know . . . I can't help it.
147,MERRY,147,You never can.
148,PIPPIN,148,"I'm sorry, alright? I won't do it again."
149,MERRY,149,"Don't you understand ... the Enemy thinks
you have the Ring . . . he's going to be
looking for you, Pip. They have to get you
out of here!"
150,PIPPIN,150,"And you. You're coming with me . . .
Merry?"
151,MERRY,151,Come on!
152,PIPPIN,152,How far is Minas Tirith?
153,GANDALF,153,"Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and
you'd better hope we don't have one of
those on our tail."
154,MERRY,154,Here - something for the road.
155,PIPPIN,155,The last of the Longbottom Leaf.
156,MERRY,156,"I know you've run out . . . you smoke too
much, Pip."
157,PIPPIN,157,But we'11 see each other soon?
158,PIPPIN (cont'd),158,Won't we?
159,MERRY,159,"I don't know . . . I don't know what's going
to happen."
160,PIPPIN,160,Merry?
161,GANDALF,161,"Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of
haste."
162,PIPPIN,162,Merry!
163,ELROND V/0,163,"Take her by the safest road. A ship lies
anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to
carry her across the Sea . . . The last
journey of Arwen Undomiel."
164,ELROND V/0 (cont'd),164,"Arwen, there is nothing for you here ...
only death."
165,ELF ESCORT O.S.,165,Lady Arwen?
166,ELF ESCORT,166,We cannot delay.
167,ELF ESCORT,167,My Lady!
168,ARWEN                            ....,168,What did you see?
169,ELROND,169,Arwen?
170,ARWEN,170,"You have the gift of foresight - tell me
what you have seen."
171,ELROND,171,I looked into your future and I saw death.
172,ARWEN,172,"There is also life.                           ,"
173,ARWEN (cont'd),173,"You saw there was a child . . .
you saw my son."
174,ELROND,174,That future is almost gone.
175,ARWEN,175,But it is not lost ...
176,ELROND,176,Nothing is certain.
177,ARWEN,177,"Some things are certain. If I leave him now
I will regret It forever."
178,ARWEN,178,"Ada, it is time."
179,A RW EN ( V .O .) (c on t' d ),179,"From the ashes of fire shall be woken,
a light from the shadow shall spring,
renewed shall be blade that was broken ..."
180,ARWEN (V.O.) (cont'd),180,The crownless again shall be King . . .
181,ARWEN V/0,181,Reforge the sword.
182,ARWEN,182,Ada ...
183,ELROND,183,Your hands are cold.
184,ELROND,184,The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
185,ELROND (cont'd),185,It has begun.
186,ARWEN,186,"This was my choice. Ada ... Whether by your
will or not, there is no ship now that can
bear me hence."
187,GANDALF,187,"We have just passed into the realm of
Condor!"
188,GANDALF,188,Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.
189,GANDALF,189,"It's the tree.           ,"
190,GANDALF,190,Gandalf! Gandalf!
191,GANDALF,191,"Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
the King."
192,GANDALF (cont'd),192,"Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
is a steward only. A caretaker of the
throne."
193,GANDALF (cont'd),193,"·,                                         (CONTINUED)"
194,GA ND ALF (c on t'd ),194,"Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
Boromir's father. To give him news of his
beloved son's death would be most unwise
... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the
Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either."
195,GA ND ALF (c on t'd ),195,"In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
all, Pippin Took."
196,GANDALF,196,"Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
Steward of Gondor."
197,GANDALF (cont'd),197,"I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
with counsel."
198,GANDALF (cont'd),198,Perhaps you come to explain this?
199,DEN ETH OR (c ont 'd ),199,"Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is
dead?"
200,.. PIPPIN,200,"Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and
me . . . he fell, defending us from many
foes."
201,GANDALF,201,Pippin!
202,PIPPIN,202,"I offer you my service, such as it is, in
payment of this debt."
203,GANDALF,203,Get up!
204,GANDALF,204,"My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
Steward, you are charged with the defence
of this city. Where are Condor's armies?"
205,GANDALF (cont'd),205,"You still have friends - you are not alone
in this fight. Send word to Theoden of
Rohan. Light the beacons."
206,DENETHOR,206,"You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
you think the eyes of the White Tower are
blind? I have seen more than you know. With
your left hand you would use me as a shield
against Mordor and with your right you
would seek to supplant me."
207,DENETHOR,207,"I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
yes. Word has reached my ears of this
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
North - last of a ragged house, long bereft
of Lordship."
208,GANDALF,208,"Authority is not given to you to deny the
return of the King - Steward!"
209,DENETHOR,209,"The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!"
210,GANDALF,210,Come.
211,PIPPIN,211,"So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
position . . . I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?"
212,GANDALF,212,"You're in the service of the Steward now -
you're going to have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took . . ."
213,GANDALF,213,Guard of the Citadel!
214,PIPPIN,214,It's so quiet.
215,GANDALF,215,It's the deep breath before the plunge.
216,PIPPIN,216,"I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
waiting on the edge of one I can't escape
is even worse.                                L"
217,PIPPIN,217,"Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and
Sam?"
218,GANDALF,218,There never was much hope.
219,GANDALF (cont'd),219,Just a fool's hope.
220,GANDALF V/0,220,"Our enemy is almost ready, his full
strength gathered. Not only Ores, but men
as well."
221,GANDALF V/0 (cont'd),221,Legions of Haradrim from the South ......
222,GANDALF V/0 (cont'd),222,"Mercenaries from the coast . . . All will
answer Mordor' s call."
223,GANDALF,223,"This will be the end of Gondor as we know
it. Here the hammerstroke will fall
hardest."
224,GANDALF V/0,224,"If the river is taken, if the garrison at
Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this
city will be gone."
225,PIPPIN,225,"But we have the White Wizard. That's got to
count for something."
226,PIPPIN (cont'd),226,Gandalf?
227,GANDALF V/0,227,"Sauron    has yet to reveal his deadliest
servant    . . . The one who will lead Mordor's
armies    in war, the one they say no living
man can    kill."
228,GANDALF,228,The Witchking of Angmar . . .
229,GANDALF,229,You've met him before . . .
230,GANDALF (cont'd),230,He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.
231,GANDALF (cont'd),231,"He is the Lord of the Nazgul - the greatest
of the nine . . ."
232,GANDALF V/0,232,And Minas Morgul is his lair.
233,GOLLUM,233,"The Dead City, very nasty place, full of
... enemies."
234,GOLLUM (cont'd),234,"Quick! Quick! They will see, they will see."
235,GOLLUM (cont'd),235,"Come away, come away. Look! We have found
it."
236,GOLLUM (cont'd),236,The way into Mordor!
237,GOLLUM (cont'd),237,The secret stairs . . . climb!
238,SAM,238,"No, Mr Frodo!"
239,GOLLUM,239,Not that way!
240,GOLLUM (cont'd),240,What's it doing?
241,SAM,241,No!
242,FRODO,242,They're calling me!
243,GOLLUM,243,Hide! Hide!
244,GOLLUM,244,I can feel his blade!
245,GANDALF,245,"We come to it at last ... the great battle
of our time."
246,GANDALF V/0,246,"This war is long planned. Sauron has hated
the west through many ages . . . It is a
hatred that flows from the depths of time,
across the deeps of the Sea."
247,GOLLUM,247,"Come, hobbits. We climb - we must climb!"
248,GANDALF,248,"The board is set, the pieces are moving."
249,GANDALF,249,"Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to
be done. Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth!"
250,GANDALF (cont'd),250,You must not fail me.
251,GOTHMOG,251,Quiet!
252,GOTHMOG,252,To the river - quick!
253,GOTHMOG,253,Faster!
254,ORC COMMANDER,254,Draw swords!
255,GANDALF,255,Amon Din ... come on . . .
256,SOLDIER,256,The beacon! The beacon at Amon Din is lit!
257,GANDALF,257,Hope is kindled.
258,ARAGORN,258,"The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons
are lit! Condor calls for aid!"
259,THEODEN,259,"Then Rohan will answer. Muster the
Rohirrim!"
260,THEODEN,260,"Assemble the army at Dunharrow - as many
men as can be found. You have two days ...
On the third, we ride for Condor ... and
war!"
261,THEODEN (cont'd),261,"Gamling, make haste across the Riddermark
... Summon every able-bodied man to
Dunharrow!"
262,ARAGORN,262,You ride with us?
263,EOWYN,263,"Just to the encampment. It's tradition for
the women of the Court to farewell the men."
264,EOWYN (cont'd),264,"The Men have found their Captain - they
will follow you into battle, even to death."
265,EOWYN (cont'd),265,You have given us hope.
266,THEODEN V/0,266,"So . . . It is before the walls of Minas
Tirith that the doom of our time will be
decided."
267,EOMER,267,"Now is the hour! Riders of Rohan - oaths
you have taken. Now, fulfil them all - to
Lord and land!"
268,MADRIL,268,We can't hold them. The city is lost!
269,FARAMIR,269,"Tell the men to break up. We ride for Minas
Tirith."
270,RANGER,270,Nazgul!
271,FARAMIR,271,Take cover!
272,FARAMIR (cont'd),272,Pull back! Pull back to Minas Tirith!
273,GOTHMOG,273,"The age of men is over. The time of the Ore
has come."
274,IORLAS,274,Open the Gates! Pull!
275,FARAMIR,275,Mithrandir!
276,FARAMIR   (cont'd),276,"They broke through    our defences. They have
taken the bridge a   nd the West Bank.
Battalions of Ores    are crossing the River."
277,IORLAS,277,"It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long
has he foreseen this doom!"
278,GANDALF,278,Foreseen and done nothing!
279,GA ND ALF (c on t'd ),279,"Faramir? ... This is not the first halfling
to have crossed your path ..."
280,FARAMIR,280,No.
281,PIPPIN,281,You've seen Frodo and Sam?
282,GANDALF,282,Where? When?
283,FARAMIR,283,"In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf -
they are taking the road to the Morgul
Vale."
284,GANDALF,284,. . . And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.
285,PIPPIN,285,What does that mean? What's wrong?
286,GANDALF,286,Faramir . . . Tell me everything.
287,GOLLUM,287,"Careful, Master - careful! Very far to
fall. Very dangerous on the stairs."
288,GOLLUM,288,"Come, Master."
289,GOLLUM (cont'd),289,Come to Smeagol.
290,SAM,290,Mr Frodo!
291,SAM (cont'd),291,"Get back, you. Don't touch him!"
292,GOLLUM,292,"Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has
Smeagol ever done to him? Master?"
293,GOLLUM (cont'd),293,"Master carries heavy burden . . . Smeagol
knows . . . Heavy, heavy burden. Fat one
cannot know. Smeagol look after Master."
294,GOLLUM (cont'd),294,"He   wants it - he needs it. Smeagol sees it
in   his eye. Very soon he will ask you for
it   - you will see . . . the Fat One will take
it   from you."
295,GOLLUM (cont'd),295,"Send forth all legions. Do not stop the
attack until the city is taken. Slay them
all."
296,GOTHMOG,296,What of the Wizard?
297,WITCH KING,297,I shall break him.
298,SOLDIER 1,298,Where are Theoden's riders?
299,SOLDIER 2,299,Will Rohan's army come?
300,SOLDIER 1,300,Mithrandir?
301,G AN DA LF,301,"Courage is the best defence that you have
now."
302,PIPPIN,302,"Here do I swear fealty and service to
Gondor, in peace or war, in living or
dying, from this hour henceforth, until my
lord release me, or death take me."
303,DENETHOR,303,"And I shall not forget it, nor fail to
reward that which is given ..."
304,DENETHOR (cont'd),304,... fealty with love ...
305,DENETHOR (cont'd),305,... valour with honour ...
306,DENETHOR (cont'd),306,... disloyalty with vengeance.
307,DENETHOR (cont'd),307,"I do not think we should so lightly abandon
the outer defences; defences that your
brother long held intact."
308,FARAMIR,308,What would you have me do?
309,DENETHOR,309,"I will not yield the River and Pelennor
unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken."
310,FARAMIR,310,"My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun."
311,DENETHOR,311,"Much must be risked in war. Is there a
Captain here who still has the courage to
do his Lord's will?"
312,FARAMIR,312,"You wish now that our places had been
exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had
lived?"
313,DENETHOR,313,"Yes, I wish that."
314,FARAMIR,314,"Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do
what I can in his stead."
315,FARAMIR (cont'd),315,"If I should return ... think better of me,.
father."
316,DENETHOR,316,"That will depend on the manner of your
return."
317,SAM,317,"What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?"
318,SMEAGOL,318,"Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
nobody else could find and they say
""Sneak!"", ""Sneak!"". Very nice friends, oh
yes, my Precious, very nice."
319,SAM,319,"Alright, alright - you just startled me is
all."
320,SAM,320,What were you doing?
321,SMEAGOL,321,Sneaking!
322,SAM,322,"Fine, have it your own way."
323,SAM (cont'd),323,"Sorry to wake you, Mr Frodo. We have to be
moving on."
324,FRODO                              .,324,It's dark still.
325,SAM,325,It's always dark here -
326,SAM (cont'd),326,It's gone . . . the Elven bread!
327,FRODO,327,What? That's all we have left!
328,SAM,328,He took it! He must have!
329,GOLLUM,329,"Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol
hates nasty Elf bread!"
330,SAM,330,"You're a lying wretch! What did you do with
it?"
331,FRODO,331,"He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken
it."
332,GOLLUM,332,What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!
333,GOLLUM,333,"He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's
always stuffing himself when Master's not
looking!"
334,SAM,334,That's a filthy lie!
335,SAM (cont'd),335,"You stinking two-faced sneak! Call me a
thie . . ."
336,FRODO,336,Sam! Stop it!
337,SAM,337,I'll kill him! I'll kill him!
338,FRODO,338,"No, Sam!"
339,SAM,339,"Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to
go so far, I was so angry . . . Here, let's
rest up a bit."
340,FRODO,340,I ' m alright.
341,SAM,341,"No, no, you're not alright! You're
exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this
place; it's that thing around your neck. I
could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a
while - share the load."
342,FRODO,342,Get away!
343,SAM,343,"I don't want to keep it . . . I just want to
help!"
344,GOLLUM,344,See! See! He wants it for himself.
345,SAM,345,"Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here."
346,FRODO,346,"No, Sam . . . it's you."
347,FRODO (cont'd),347,"I'm sorry, Sam ..."
348,SAM,348,"But . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you
against me."
349,FRODO,349,You can't help me anymore.
350,SAM,350,You don't mean that.
351,FRODO,351,Go home.
352,GANDALF,352,"Faramir! Your father's will has turned to
madness! Do not throw away your life so
rashly!"
353,FARAMIR,353,Where does my allegiance lie if not here?
354,GANDALF,354,"Your father loves you, Faramir!"
355,GANDALF,355,And will remember it before the end.
356,DENETHOR,356,"Can you sing, Master Hobbit?"
357,PIPPIN,357,"Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my
own people ... but we have no songs for
great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
sing of anything more terrible than wind or
rain."
358,DENETHOR,358,"And why should your songs be unfit for my
halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
sing me a song!"
359,DENETHOR,359,"Home is behind, the world ahead,
And there are many paths to tread.
Through shadow to the edge of night
Until the stars are all alight.
Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
All shall fade, all shall fade."
360,THEODEN,360,"Grimbold, how many?"
361,GRIMBOLD,361,"I bring five hundred men from the Westfold,
my Lord."
362,ROHAN MARSHALL (0.S.),362,"We have three hundred more from Fenmarch,
Theoden, King."
363,DENETHOR,363,Where are the riders from Snowbourne?
364,GAMLING ( O . S . ),364,"None have come, My Lord."
365,THEODEN,365,"Six thousand spears . . . less than half of
what I had hoped for . . ."
366,ARAGORN,366,"Six thousand will not be enough to break
the lines of Mordor."
367,THEODEN,367,More will come.
368,ARAGORN                 ;,368,"Every hour lost hastens Condor's defeat. We
have till dawn. Then we must ride."
369,LEGOLAS,369,"The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;.
quiet ..?"
370,EOMER,370,"They grow nervous in the shadow of the
mountain . . ."
371,GIMLI,371,That road there - where does that lead?
372,LEGOLAS,372,"It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door
under the mountain."
373,EOMER,373,None who venture there ever return.
374,EOMER,374,That mountain is evil . . .
375,GIMLI O.S,375,Aragorn!
376,GIMLI,376,Let's find some food.
377,EOWYN,377,There! A true Esquire of Rohan.
378,MERRY,378,Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.
379,MERRY,379,It isn't even sharp.
380,EOWYN,380,"Well, that's no good. You won't kill many
Ores with a blunt blade. Come on."
381,EOWYN,381,To the Smithy .- go!
382,EOMER,382,You should not encourage him.
383,EOWYN,383,And you should not doubt him.
384,EOMER,384,"I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach
of his arm."
385,EOMER,385,hm                                                      .
386,EOWYN,386,"Why should Merry be left behind? He has as
much cause to go to war as you."
387,EOWYN,387,Why can he not fight for those he loves?
388,GANDALF V/0,388,Look to the Black Ships . . .
389,ARWEN V/0,389,"I choose a mortal life . . . I wish I could
have seen him, one last time ..."
390,GUARD,390,"King Theoden awaits you, my Lord."
391,THEODEN,391,I take my leave.
392,ARAGORN,392,"My Lord, Elrond."
393,ELROND,393,I come on behalf of one whom I love.
394,ELROND (cont'd),394,Arwen is dying.
395,ARAGORN,395,She stayed?
396,ELROND,396,"She will not long survive the evil that now
spreads from Mordor."
397,ELROND (cont'd),397,"The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
end has come."
398,ARAGORN,398,"It will not be our end, but his."
399,ELROND,399,"You ride to war, but not to victory.
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
this you know - but in secret he sends
another force which will attack from the
river . . ."
400,ELROND (cont'd),400,"A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the
South."
401,ELROND (cont'd),401,"They will be in the city in two days . . .
You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
men."
402,ARAGORN,402,There are none.
403,ELROND,403,There are those who dwell in the mountain.
404,ARAGORN,404,"Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
them to fight? They believe in nothing.
They answer to no-one."
405,ELROND,405,They will answer to the King of Condor.
406,ELROND (cont'd),406,"Anduril, flame of the West . . . forged from
the shards of Narsil."
407,ARAGORN,407,"Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of
Elendil . . ."
408,A RAG OR N (c on t' d),408,". . . the blade that was broken shall return
to Minas Tirith."
409,ELROND,409,"The man who can wield the power of this
sword can summon to him an army more deadly
than any that walks this earth."
410,ELROND (cont'd),410,"Put aside the Ranger - become who you were
born to be - take the Dimhplt Road."
411,ELROND (cont'd),411,Onen i-estel Edain.
412,ARAGORN,412,"U-chebin estel anim.
I keep none for myself."
413,EOWYN,413,Why are you doing this?
414,EOWYN (cont'd),414,"The war lies to.the East. You cannot leave
on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon         ;
the men."
415,ARAGORN,415,"Eowyn . . .
· EOWYN
We need you here -                    ,"
416,ARAGORN,416,Why have you come?
417,EOWYN,417,Do you not know?
418,ARAGORN,418,"It is but a shadow and a thought that you
love . . . I cannot give you what you seek."
419,GIMLI,419,And just where do you think you're off to?
420,ARAGORN,420,"Not this time ... This time you must stay,
my friend."
421,LEGOLAS O.S,421,"Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness
of Dwarves?"
422,GIMLI,422,"You might as well accept it - we're going
with you, laddie."
423,GAMLING,423,Lord Aragorn!
424,ROHAN SOLDIER O.S.,424,Why does he leave on the eve of battle?
425,GAMLING,425,He leaves because there is no hope.
426,THEODEN,426,He leaves because he must.
427,GAMLING,427,"Too few have come. We cannot defeat the
armies of Mordor."
428,THEODEN,428,"No, we cannot . . ."
429,THEODEN,429,"But we will meet them in battle,
nonetheless."
430,THEODEN,430,"I have left instruction: the people are to
follow your rule in my stead ... take up my
seat in the Golden Hall ... long may you
defend Edoras if the battle goes ill."
431,EOWYN,431,"What other duty would you have me do, my
Lord?"
432,THEODEN,432,"Duty? ... No, I would have you smile again -
not grieve for those whose time has come."
433,THEODEN (cont'd),433,You shall live to see these days renewed.
434,THEODEN (cont'd),434,No more despair.
435,GIMLI,435,"What kind of an army would linger in such a
place?"
436,LEGOLAS,436,"One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of
the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight,
but when the time came, when Condor's need
was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the
darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur
cursed them - never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge."
437,GIMLI,437,"The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
away."
438,LEGOLAS,438,"The way is shut. It was made by those who
are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
shut."
439,ARAGORN,439,Brego!
440,ARAGORN (cont'd),440,I do not fear death ...
441,GIMLI,441,"Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf
will go underground when a Dwarf dare not."
442,GIMLI,442,Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!
443,THEODEN,443,"We must ride light and swift. It's a long
road ahead ... and man and beast must reach
the end with the strength to fight."
444,THEODEN (cont'd),444,"Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master
Meriadoc!"
445,MERRY,445,"All my friends have gone to battle. I would
be ashamed to be left behind!"
446,THEODEN,446,"It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.
None of my Riders can bear you as a burden."
447,MERRY,447,But . . . I want to fight!
448,THEODEN,448,I will say no more.
449,EOWYN,449,Ride with me.
450,MERRY,450,My Lady!
451,EOMER,451,Move out - move out!
452,THEODEN,452,"Ride! Ride now, for Gondor!"
453,THEODEN,453,A GHOSTLY FIGURE step from the ROCK WALLS!
454,THEODEN,454,Who enters my domain?
455,ARAGORN,455,One who will have your allegiance.
456,ARAGORN,456,The dead do not suffer the living to pass ...
457,ARAGORN,457,You will suffer me!
458,ARAGORN,458,AE
459,ARAGORN,459,The way is shut . . .
460,ARAGORN,460,"It was made by those who are Dead and the
Dead keep it . . ."
461,ARAGORN,461,I summon you to fulfil your oath!
462,ARAGORN,462,None but the King of Gondor may command me!
463,KING OF THE DEAD (cont'd),463,It cannot be - that line was broken!
464,ARAGORN,464,It has been remade!
465,ARAGORN (cont'd),465,Fight for us and regain your honour!
466,ARAGORN (cont'd),466,What say you?
467,ARAGORN (cont'd),467,"What say you?                                 ,   ."
468,GIMLI,468,"Aghh! Your wasting your time, Aragprn. They
had no honour in life, they have none now
in death."
469,ARAGORN,469,"I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me and I
will hold your oath fulfilled. What say
you?"
470,GATE GUARD,470,Open the gate! Quick!
471,IORLAS,471,Lord Faramir!
472,DENETHOR,472,Faramir!
473,DENETHOR (cont'd),473,Say not that he has fallen . . .
474,IORLAS,474,"They were outnumbered, none survived."
475,GOTHMOG,475,"Fear! The city is rank with it. Let us ease
their pain. Release the prisoners!"
476,LIEUTENANT,476,Catapults!
477,DENETHOR,477,My son is dead. My line is ended.
478,PIPPIN,478,He's alive!
479,DENETHOR,479,The House of Stewards has failed! . . .
480,PIPPIN,480,"He needs medicine, my Lord!"
481,DENETHOR,481,My line has ended.
482,PIPPIN,482,My Lord!
483,DENETHOR,483,Rohan has deserted us!
484,DENETHOR (cont'd),484,Theoden's betrayed me!
485,DENETHOR (cont'd),485,Abandon your posts!
486,DENETHOR (cont'd),486,Flee! Flee for your lives!
487,GOTHMOG,487,Stay where you are!
488,GANDALF,488,"Stand to your posts! Do not give in to
fear. Fight!"
489,GANDALF (cont'd),489,"Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls! Kill
the trolls! Bring them down!"
490,GANDALF (cont'd),490,Peregrin Took - go .back to the citadel!
491,PIPPIN,491,They called us out to fight . . .
492,GANDALF,492,This is no place for a Hobbit!
493,GANDALF (cont'd),493,"Guard of the Citadel, indeed! Now, back up
the hill - quickly! Quickly!"
494,ORCS,494,Grond! Grond! Grond!
495,FRODO,495,What is this place?
496,GOLLUM,496,Master must go inside the tunnel.
497,FRODO,497,"Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to."
498,SMEAGOL,498,It's the only way.
499,SMEAGOL,499,Go in - or go back.
500,FRODO,500,I can't go back.
501,FRODO,501,What's that smell?
502,GOLLUM,502,"Orcses filth! Orcses come in here
sometimes."
503,GOLLUM O.S..,503,Hurry!
504,GOLLUM O.S.(cont'd),504,This way.
505,FRODO,505,Smeagol!
506,GOLLUM O.S.,506,Over here.
507,FRODO,507,It's sticky . . . What is it?
508,GOLLUM O.S.,508,"You will see . . . Oh, yes . . . You will see."
509,FRODO,509,Smeagol! Smeagol!
510,FRODO (cont'd),510,Smeagol!
511,FRODO (cont'd),511,"Sm. . .
a"
512,GALADRIEL V/0,512,"I give you the light of Earendil - our most
beloved star. May it be a light for you in
dark places when all other lights go out."
513,FRODO,513,Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!
514,GOLLUM O.S.,514,"Naughty little fly,
Why does it cry?"
515,GOLLUM,515,"Caught in a web
Soon you'll be . . .
. ?. Eaten!"
516,GOLLUM,516,"Got away did it, Precious? Not this time,
not this time!"
517,SMEAGOL,517,"It wasn't us! It wasn't us! Smeagol
wouldn't hurt Master."
518,SMEAGOL (cont'd),518,"Smeagol promised. You must believe us. It
was the Precious - the Precious made us to
do it."
519,FRODO,519,"I have to destroy it, Smeagol. I have to
destroy it for both our sakes."
520,FRODO,520,"I'm so sorry, Sam . . ."
521,FRODO (cont'd),521,. . . so sorry ...
522,GALADRIEL V/0,522,"This task was appointed to you, Frodo of
the Shire. If you do not find a way ... no-
one will."
523,GANDALF,523,To the Gates! Man the Gates!
524,DENETHOR,524,"No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long
slow sleep of death embalmed . . . we shall
burn - like the heathen kings of old!"
525,DENETHOR (cont'd),525,Bring wood and oil . . .
526,DENETHOR (cont'd),526,L                          .
527,GANDALF,527,Steady! Steady!
528,GANDALF (cont'd),528,"You are soldiers of Gondor! No matter what
comes through that gate you will stand your
ground!"
529,GANDALF (cont'd),529,Fire!
530,SAM,530,"Let him go, you filth!"
531,SAM (cont'd),531,You will not touch him again!
532,SAM (cont'd),532,Come on and finish it!
533,SAM (cont'd),533,Mr Frodo!                        .
534,SAM (cont'd),534,Oh no! Frodo!
535,SAM (cont'd),535,Mr Frodo! Wake up!
536,SAM (cont'd),536,"Wake up . . . don't leave me here alone.
Don't go where I can't follow. Wake up!"
537,SAM (cont'd),537,Not asleep ... Dead.
538,SAM (cont'd),538,"What's this? Looks like Old Shelob's been
having a bit of fun!"
539,SAM (cont'd),539,"Killed another one, has she?"
540,SAM (cont'd),540,No . . . this fellow ain't dead.
541,SAM,541,Not dead!
542,GORBAG,542,"She jabs them with her stinger and they go
as limp as a boned fish. Then she has her
way with them. That's how she likes to feed
- fresh blood."
543,GORBAG,543,Get him to the Tower!
544,SAM,544,"Samwise, you fool!"
545,ORC 2,545,This fellow will be awake in a few hours.
546,GORBAG,546,Then he'll wish he'd never been born.
547,DENETHOR,547,"The house of his spirit crumbles! He is
burning ... already burning.                    7"
548,PIPPIN,548,He's not dead! He's not dead!
549,PIPPIN (cont'd),549,No! No! No! He's not dead. No!
550,DENETHOR,550,"Farewell Peregrin, son of Paladin . . . I
release you from my service ..."
551,DENETHOR (cont'd),551,"Go now and die in what way seems best to
you."
552,DENETHOR (cont'd),552,Pour oil on the wood!
553,PIPPIN,553,Gandalf? ... Gandalf?
554,GANDALF,554,"Pull back - to the second level! Hurry! Get
the women and children out of here - get
them out!"
555,GOTHMOG,555,"Move into the city ... Kill all in your
path."
556,GANDALF,556,Fight! Fight for your lives!
557,EOWYN,557,"Courage, Merry ... courage for our friends"
558,GOTHMOG,558,"Form ranks you maggots! Form ranks! Pikes
in front, lances behind."
559,THEODEN,559,"Eomer! Take your Eored down the left flank
. . . Gamling! Follow the King's banner down
the centre. Grimbold, take your company
right after we pass the wall. Forth and
fear no darkness!"
560,THEODEN (cont'd),560,"Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden! Spears
shall be shaken, shields shall be
splintered . . . a sword day, a red day ^ere
the sun rises!"
561,EOWYN,561,"(terrified)
Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look
after you."
562,THEODEN,562,"(stirring call)
Ride now, ride now, ride, ride for ruin and
the world's ending!"
563,THE ODEN ( cont'd ),563,Death!
564,THE ODEN ( cont'd ),564,"(6000 voices)
Death!                               ... .."
565,THEODEN,565,Death!
566,MERRY,566,Death!
567,EOWYN,567,Death!
568,THEODEN,568,"(yelling)
Death! Forth Eorlingas!"
569,GOTHMOG,569,Fire!
570,THEODEN,570,Charge !
571,PIPPIN,571,Gandalf!
572,PIPPIN (cont'd),572,"Denethor has lost his mind! He's burning
Faramir alive!"
573,GANDALF,573,Come! Quickly!
574,"DENETHOR                        ,-",574,Set a fire in our flesh!
575,GANDALF,575,Stay this madness!
576,DENETHOR,576,No! Do not take my son from me!
577,DENETHOR (cont'd),577,"(whisper)
Faramir . . ."
578,CANDALF,578,"So passes Denethor, Son of Ecthelion."
579,EOMER,579,Drive them into the river!
580,THEODEN                              .,580,Make safe the city!
581,THEODEN (cont'd),581,Reform the line...Reform the line!
582,THEODEN (cont'd),582,Sound the charge!
583,THEODEN (cont'd),583,... Charge!
584,PIPPIN,584,I didn't think it would end this way . . .
585,GANDALF,585,"End? No, the journey doesn't end here."
586,GANDALF (cont'd),586,"Death is just another path, one that we all
must take."
587,GANDALF (cont'd),587,"The grey rain curtain of this world rolls
back and all turns to silver glass . . ."
588,GANDALF (cont'd),588,and then you see it . . .
589,PIPPIN,589,"What, Gandalf? See what?"
590,GANDALF,590,"White shores ... And beyond . . . A far green
country under a swift sunrise."
591,PIPPIN,591,"Well, that isn't so bad."
592,GANDALF,592,"No . . . No, it isn't."
593,THEODEN,593,Rally to me! To me!
594,THEODEN,594,Feast on his flesh!
595,EOWYN,595,I will kill you if you touch him!
596,WITCH-KING,596,"Do not come between the Nazgul and his
prey!"
597,ORC COMMANDER,597,"Late as usual! Get off your ships, you sea
rats! There's knife work here needs doing."
598,GIMLI,598,"· ··· Plenty for the both of us . . . May the best
dwarf win!"
599,WITCH KING,599,No man can kill me . . . Die!
600,EOWYN,600,I am no man!
601,GIMLI,601,That still only counts as one!
602,THEODEN,602,I know your face ... Eowyn ...
603,THEODEN (cont'd),603,My eyes darken ...
604,EOWYN,604,No . . . I am going to save you ...
605,THEODEN,605,You already did . . .
606,THEODEN,606,My body is broken ... you have to let me go
607,EOWYN,607,"N ...
o"
608,THEODEN,608,"I go to my fathers . . . in whose mighty
company, I shall not now feel ashamed ..."
609,THEODEN (cont'd),609,Eowyn?
610,KING OF THE DEAD,610,Release us.
611,GIMLI,611,"Bad idea. Very handy in a tight spot, these
lads - despite the fact, they're dead!"
612,KING OF THE DEAD,612,You gave us your word.
613,ARAGORN,613,"I hold your oath fulfilled . . . Go. Be at
peace."
614,PIPPIN,614,Merry ...?
615,PIPPIN (cont'd),615,"Merry . . . it's me, it's Pippin . . ."
616,MERRY,616,I knew you'd find me.
617,MERRY,617,Are you going to leave me?
618,PIPPIN,618,"No Merry, I'm going to look after you."
619,SHAGRAT,619,"Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's
mine."
620,GORBAG,620,"It's going to the Great Eye, along with
everything else . . ."
621,SHAGRAT,621,"I don't take orders from stinking Morgul
rats!"
622,GORBAG,622,"You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in
your guts!"
623,SHAGRAT,623,The scum tried to knife me! Kill him!
624,SAM,624,That's for Frodo!
625,SAM,625,And for the Shire!
626,SAM,626,And that's for my old Gaffer!
627,GORBAG,627,Stop your squeaking you dunghill rat!
628,GORBAG,628,I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!
629,SAM,629,Not if I stick you first!
630,FRODO,630,Sam!!!
631,FRODO (cont'd),631,"Oh, Sam . . . I'm so sorry . . . sorry for
everything."
632,SAM,632,Come on.
633,FRODO,633,"It's too late. It's over . . . they've taken
it. Sam - they took the Ring!!"
634,SAM,634,"Begging your pardon, but they haven't."
635,SAM (cont'd),635,"I thought I ' d lost you . . . so I took it -
only for safe-keeping."
636,SAM (cont'd),636,IG
637,FRODO,637,Give it to me.
638,FRODO (cont'd),638,"Give me the Ring, Sam."
639,FRODO (cont'd),639,Sam! Give me the Ring.
640,FRODO (cont'd),640,ek
641,FRODO (cont'd),641,"You must understand . . . The Ring is my
burden . . . it will destroy you, Sam."
642,SAM,642,"Come on, Mr Frodo, we'd best find you some
clothes . . . you can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin."
643,SAM,643,"We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor."
644,FRODO,644,"There are so many of them . . . So many.
We'll never get through unseen."
645,FRODO (cont'd),645,It's him - the Eye.
646,SAM,646,"We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's
nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters."
647,GANDALF,647,"Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
darkness is deepening."
648,ARAGORN,648,"If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it."
649,GANDALF,649,"It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
Mordor our enemy is regrouping."
650,GIMLI,650,"Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
we care?"
651,GANDALF,651,"Because ten thousand Ores now stand between
Frodo and Mount Doom."
652,GANDALF (cont'd),652,I have sent him to his death.
653,ARAGORN,653,No.
654,ARAGORN (cont'd),654,"There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
time and safe passage across the Plains of
Gorgoroth. We can give him that."
655,GANDALF,655,How?
656,ARAGORN,656,"Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
Then we gather our full strength and march
on the Black Gate."
657,EOMER,657,"We cannot achieve victory from strength of
arms ."
658,ARAGORN,658,"Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo
his chance if we keep Sauron' s eye fixed
upon us. Keep him blind to all else that
moves ."
659,LEGOLAS,659,A diversion . . .
660,GANDALF,660,"Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not
take the bait!"
661,GIMLI,661,"Certainty of death. Small chance of
success. What are we waiting for?"
662,SAM,662,"Look, the Ores! They're moving off. You
see, Mr Frodo - some luck at last."
663,SAM,663,Take mine . . . there's a few drops left.
664,FRODO,664,"There'll be none left for the return
journey."
665,SAM,665,"I don't think there will be a return
journey, Mr Frodo."
666,SAM,666,"Fo o g td w
rd , e on"
667,PIPPIN,667,Where are they?
668,ARAGORN,668,"Let the lord of the Black Land come forth;
let justice be done upon him."
669,ARAGORN,669,Pull back! Pull back!
670,SAM,670,"It's gone, Mr Frodo."
671,SAM (cont'd),671,"The light's passed on, away towards the
North . . . something's drawn it's gaze."
672,ARAGORN,672,"Hold your ground - hold your ground! Sons
of Gondor - of Rohan . . . my brothers!"
673,ARAGORN (cont'd),673,"I see in your eyes the same fear that would
take the heart of me. The day may come when
the courage of Men fails; when we forsake
our friends and break all bonds of
fellowship; but it is not this day - an
hour of wolves and shattered shields, when
the Age of Man comes crashing down - but it
is not this day!!! This day we fight! By
all that you hold dear on this good earth -
I bid you stand!"
674,ARAGORN (cont'd),674,Men of the West!
675,GIMLI,675,"Never thought I ' d die fighting side by side
with an Elf."
676,LEGOLAS,676,What about side by side with a friend?
677,GIMLI,677,Aye - I could do that.
678,SAM,678,"Do you remember the Shire, Mr Frodo?
. . . It'll be spring soon, and the orchards
will be in blossom; and the birds will be
nesting in the hazel thicket; and they'11
be sowing the summer barley in the lower
fields; and eating the first of the
strawberries with cream."
679,SAM,679,Do you remember the taste of strawberries?
680,FRODO,680,"No, Sam. I can't recall    the taste of food;
nor the sound of water;     nor the touch of
grass . . . I'm naked in   the dark."
681,FRODO,681,"There's no veil between    me and the wheel of
fire. I can see it with    my waking eyes."
682,SAM,682,"Then let us be rid of it - once and for
all! Come on, Mr Frodo. I can't carry it
for you ... but I can carry you! Come on!"
683,ARAGORN,683,"(softly)
For Frodo . . ."
684,SAM,684,"Look, Mr Frodo! We're almost there!       -.-."
685,GOLLUM,685,Clever Hobbits to climb so high!
686,SAM,686,Frodo!
687,PIPPIN,687,"(disbelieving)
Eagles . . ."
688,. . . PIPPIN (cont'd),688,The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!
689,SAM,689,Frodo!
690,FRODO,690,"I'm here, Sam."
691,SAM,691,Destroy it - go on! Throw it in the fire!
692,SAM (cont'd),692,What are you waiting for? Just let it go!
693,FRODO,693,The Ring is mine.
694,SAM,694,No!        :
695,GOLLUM,695,Precious! Precious!
696,SAM,696,Give me your hand.
697,SAM (cont'd),697,Take my hand!
698,SAM (cont'd),698,No!
699,SAM (cont'd),699,Don't you let go! Don't let go.
700,SAM (cont'd),700,Reach!!!
701,SAM (cont'd),701,It's gone . . . it's done.
702,SAM,702,"Yes, Mr. Frodo ... it's over now."
703,FRODO,703,"I can see the Shire ... The Brandywine
River, Bag End, Gandalf's fireworks . . . the
lights in the Party Tree . . ."
704,SAM,704,"Rosie Cotton dancing ... she had ribbons in
her hair . . .
(sobs)
. . . if ever I was to marry someone . . . it
would have been her . . . it would have been
her."
705,FRODO,705,"I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee . . .
here at the end of all things."
706,FRODO,706,Gandalf?
707,GANDALF,707,Now come the days of the King ...
708,GANDALF (cont'd)                      :,708,May they be blessed.
709,ARAGORN,709,"This day does not belong to one man but to
all. Let us together rebuild this world
that we may share in the days of peace."
710,ARAGORN (cont'd),710,My friends ... you bow to no-one.
711,ARAGORN (cont'd),711,"And thus it was a Fourth Age of     Middle-
earth began, and the Fellowship     of the
Ring, though eternally bound by     friendship
and love, was ended.
Thirteen months to the day since    Gandalf      ,.
sent us on our long journey . . ."
712,ARAGORN (cont'd),712,". . . we found ourselves looking upon a
familiar sight . . . We were home!"
713,ARAGORN (cont'd),713,"How do you pick up the threads of an old
life? How do you go on, when in your heart
you begin to understand. There is no going
back. There are some things that time
cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep.
That have taken hold."
714,ARAGORN (cont'd),714,Mr Frodo?
715,SAM                 .,715,What is it?                -
716,FRODO,716,"It's been four years to the day since
Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed."
717,FRODO,717,"""There and Back Again . . . A      Hobbit's Tale,
by Bilbo Baggins""."
718,SAM (cont'd),718,""" . . . And The Lord of the Rings, by Frodo
Baggins""."
719,SAM (cont'd),719,You've finished it!                                 -
720,FRODO,720,"Not quite . . . There's room for a little
more."
721,FRODO,721,"Bilbo once told me, the great stories never
end - that each of us must come and go in
the telling. His part in this tale was now
over. There would be no more journeys for
Bilbo. Save one."
722,BILBO O.S.,722,"Tell me again, lad. Where are we going?"
723,BILBO O.S.,723,"To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have
accorded you a special honour. A place on
the last ship to leave Middle-earth."
724,BILBO,724,"Frodo ... Any chance of seeing that old
ring of mine ... the one I gave you?"
725,FRODO,725,"Sorry, Uncle . . . I'm afraid, I lost it."
726,BILBO,726,"Oh . . . pity. I should like to have held it
one last time.                                   ·"
727,BILBO,727,i
728,BILBO,728,"Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never·seen
before."
729,GALADRIEL,729,"The power of the Three Rings is ended. The
time has come for the Dominion of Men."
730,ELROND,730,"I Aear can ven na mar.
T he Sea calls us ho me."
731,BILBO,731,"I think I'm quite ready for another
adventure."
732,GANDALF,732,"Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
finished. Here at last, on the shores of
the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship."
733,GANDALF (cont'd),733,"I will not say: ""do not weep"", for not all
tears are an evil."
734,GANDALF (cont'd),734,"It is time, Frodo."
735,SAM,735,What does he mean?
736,FRODO,736,"We set out to save the Shire, and it has
been saved ... but not for me . . ."
737,SAM,737,You don't mean that - you can't leave.
738,FRODO,738,"The last pages are for you, Sam."
739,SAM,739,Elanor!
740,FRODO V/0,740,"My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
two. You have to be one and whole for many
years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
to do. Because Sam, your part in the
journey goes on."
741,SAM,741,"Hello, little Frodo!"
742,SAM (cont'd),742,Well ... I'm back.
