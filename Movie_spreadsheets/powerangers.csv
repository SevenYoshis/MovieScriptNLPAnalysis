0,VOICE,0,"In a time of great strife, a
legendary interdimensional being
known as Zordon, came to the city
of Angel Grove to establish a
vanguard in the never ending
struggle against evil.  with the
aid of his trusted assistant,
Alpha 5, the noble master sought
out six extraordinary teenagers
and gave them the power to
transform into an unstoppable
fighting force.  In time of great
need, the young heroes could now
call upon colossal assault
vehicles known as ""Zords"".  while
the identity of the six remained
a guarded secret, their
courageous exploits soon became
the stuff of Legend, earning them
the title...  The Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers."

28,MR. KELMAN,28,Three for three.  Look at `em go!
29,MR. KELMAN,29,"That's five perfect landings!
Now it's all up to Tommy Oliver."
30,TOMMY,30,Touch down.
31,FRED,31,Looking good up there.
32,TOMMY,32,"Thanks, man."
33,MR. KELMAN,33,"Congratulations - the
Observatory's got a new lease on
life."
34,FRED,34,"Awesome!   Ryan's Comet is passing
over in two days!"
35,AISHA,35,Who's up for lunch?
36,ROCKY,36,You read my mind.
37,KIMBERLY,37,Last one to Ernies buys.
38,ADAM,38,Let's roll!
39,SKULL,39,"Stealth Eagle, huh?  The Lame
Duck is more like it!"
40,TOMMY,40,Let's take the shortcut!
41,CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2,41,Whadda you figure it is?!
42,CONSTRUCTION WORKER #1,42,"Hey, ya got me."
43,CONSTRUCTION  WORKER  # 1,43,... I'll be damned.
44,CONSTRUCTION WORKER #1,44,AHHHHHHHHH!
45,REPORTER,45,"We're here at the World Center
Construction Site, where a
mysterious object was just
uncovered in a freak accident in
which one workman suffered minor
injuries..."
46,REPORTER,46,"... Angel Grove Police have
cordoned off the area until it
can be determined whether or not
the unidentified object poses any
threat.  The injured workman was
quoted as saying..."
47,TOMMY,47,"It's one smooth move and then
you've gotta explode off the top."
48,TOMMY,48,Nice and easy.
49,ERNIE,49,"Hey, no Karate on the patio!"
50,FRED,50,"Actually, Ernie, it's Tae-Kwan
Doe."
51,ERNIE,51,"Well Tae-Kwan-Do-it some place
else."
52,ERNIE,52,"So, what're the plans for the
weekend?"
53,KIMBERLY,53,"Aisha and.I are checking out a
new dance spot."
54,AISHA,54,I heard that!
55,BILLY,55,"I'll be at the Observatory
Sunday."
56,ERNIE,56,That's right - Ryan's Comet.
57,ROCKY,57,"We should throw a little comet
shindig."
58,ADAM,58,Any excuse for a party.
59,AISHA,59,The Eagle has landed.
60,BULK,60,"The earth was hurtling toward us
at seven hundred miles per hour,
and we knew at that moment that
we were facing death straight in
the eye."
61,SKULL,61,We could smell it's breath.
62,ROCKY,62,There's a spot over there.
63,TOMMY (into  communicator),63,"What's up, Alpha?"
64,ALPHA 5 (V.O.),64,"Rangers, we need you at the
Command  Center,  L.R.N. !"
65,KIMBERLY,65,'Like Right Now.'
66,TOMMY,66,We're on our way.
67,TOMMY,67,What's happening?
68,ALPHA 5,68,"Ay,  yi,  yi,  yi,  yi !  Our
thermionic-sensors have been hit
by a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil!"
69,ZORDON,69,"Rangers, you must act swiftly.
The planet is in GRAVE danger!"
70,KIMBERLY,70,Danger from what?
71,ZORDON,71,"Six thousand years ago a
morphological being known as Ivan
Ooze, ruled the world with a
reign of unparalleled terror.
Finally, a rebel factor known as
the ""Order of the Meledon"" lured
him into a hyperlock chamber and
buried him deep underground."
72,ALPHA 5,72,"In a place that came to be known
as Angel Grove."
73,ZORDON,73,"The chamber has been accidently
UNCOVERED!  You must return it to
the depths. or  anyone should
open it and Ivan is released!"
74,ALPHA 5,74,"To assist you I have retro-fitted
your helmets with new Opti-Scan
devices."
75,ZORDON,75,"Use extreme caution, Rangers.
You are dealing with an evil here
that is beyond ALL comprehension."
76,RITA,76,"Another Saturday night and I'm
traipsing around the galaxy with
the THREE LITTLE PIGS!  My mother
warned me this would happen!
Rita, she said, after 89
marriages you might wanna think
about throwing in the towel.  Why
didn't I listen to her?!"
77,ZEDD,77,That's a good question.
78,FIRST SECURITY GUARD,78,"Uh... Kurt...  you might wanna
take a look at this."
79,ZEDD,79,"No need to wake him.  In fact,
why don't you take a little nap
yourself."
80,MORDANT,80,"Hey bonehead, get off my hoof!"
81,ZEDD,81,"After two thousand years of
searching...  I have finally
found you."
82,MORDANT,82,"Yo, earth to Bigfoot!"
83,GOLDAR,83,"Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball!"
84,ZEDD,84,SILENCE!
85,RITA (to  Goldar),85,"Where did you FIND this rabid
little rodent, anyway?!"
86,GOLDAR,86,"Mordant's my second cousin three
times removed on my mother's
side.  He`s just visiting for the
summer."
87,RITA,87,Well put a muzzle on him!
88,RITA,88,"What... you spent two thousand
years looking for this tub of
SNOT!"
89,ZEDD,89,"Don't you ever have anything nice
to say?!"
90,RITA,90,"Well, if I did I certainly
wouldn't say it to you!"
91,MORDANT,91,Boss.
92,ZEDD,92,"For your information this is not
just your average, run-of-the-
mill tub of snot !"
93,RITA,93,"You're trying to tell me there`re
different levels of snot?!"
94,MORDANT,94,Boss.
95,ZEDD,95,WHAT!
96,IVAN,96,Ahhhhhhhh.
97,IVAN,97,"Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE
is back!!"
98,RITA,98,He's so cute.
99,ZEDD,99,"I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of
all that is good and decent.  It
is a supreme honor to finally
meet you."
100,IVAN,100,How can I ever repay you?
101,ZEDD,101,"Do you recall the name...  Zordon
of Eltare?"
102,MORDANT,102,Seems to ring a bell.
103,ZEDD,103,"I want you to destroy Zordon, so
that my evil may once again reign
SUPREME."
104,IVAN (hissing),104,"I will not only destroy him, I
will OBLITERATE his entire being.
It will be like Zordon
of Eltare never EXISTED!"
105,RITA,105,"Finally, a real man."
106,GOLDAR,106,Here's his address.
107,IVAN (reading),107,"""... left off Interstate 12?!"""
108,IVAN (reading),108,"What's an ""interstate""?"
109,MORDANT,109,"It's like a freeway.  How long
have  you  been  locked  up? !"
110,ZEDD,110,"We shall leave you to weave your
wicked ways."
111,RITA,111,"Now we go out on the town.  First
dinner, then dancing, then --"
112,IVAN,112,What is that odious stench?
113,IVAN,113,Smell's like...   TEENAGERS!
114,BILLY,114,"Remind me to have a word with
Alpha about his teleporting
calculations."
115,AISHA,115,Anybody see anything?
116,TOMMY,116,... Let's take a look over there.
117,ROCKY (alarmed),117,It looks like it's been opened!
118,SECURITY GUARD (O.S.},118,Hey!
119,SECURITY GUARD,119,You had me scared there.
120,AISHA,120,Makes two of us.
121,KIMBERLY,121,"You haven't by any chance seen
a ... morphological being lurking
around?"
122,SECURITY GUARD,122,"The only thing I've seen is you
teenagers."
123,(beat),123,"And you know... if there's one
thing in the world I reeeeally
hate...."
124,IVAN,124,It's TEENAGERS
125,KIMBERLY,125,GroSS!
126,IVAN,126,"You're too kind.  Allow me to
introduce myself.  I am the
infamous, world-reviled,
universally despised, IVAN OOZE!"
127,ROCKY,127,"Well, pack your bags cause we're
sending you back where you came
from!"
128,IVAN,128,"Gee, a teenager with a big mouth.
Not much has changed in six
thousand years."
129,KIMBERLY,129,"we're not just teenagers, raisin-
head."
130,TOMMY,130,"We're the Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers!"
131,IVAN,131,"Ooooh, where's my autoqraph
book?."
132,IVAN,132,"Power Rangers, huh?  So Zordon is
still using a bunch of rug-rats
to do his dirty work.  And
speaking of rats..."
133,IVAN,133,"From this moment forth, the world
as you know it SHALL CEASE TO
EXIST!"
134,IVAN,134,WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE!
135,ROCKY,135,He's  gone.
136,ADAM,136,Let's take these beasts!!
137,ZORDON,137,"Alpha, my sensors tell me the
Rangers were too late!  Ivan is
on his way here!"
138,ALPHA 5,138,"Hey, NOBODY enters the Command
Center without a power coin!"
139,ALPHA 5,139,Well...  ALMOST nobody.
140,IVAN,140,"Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy.  I
guess if you invest your money
well over SIXTY centuries you can
buy something pretty nice."
141,ALPHA 5,141,"HI ,  YAH !"
142,ALPHA  5,142,"Welcome to Wiener World.  May I
take your order, please?"
143,ZORDON,143,"You haven't changed, Ooze.
You're still picking on creatures
smaller than yourself."
144,IVAN,144,"Put a cork in it ""Z"" .  Ten
minutes out of the egg and I'm
already listening to one of your
lectures.
(he explodes furiously)
You robbed me of my PRIME!  I was
the Supreme Ruler of the most
foul Empire in the Universe.  I
was the King of Calamity.  The
Duke of Destruction.  The big man
on campus!"
145,(beat),145,"And then you came along.  You
locked me into your stuffy little
hyperlock-chamber and tossed me
into the depths like yesterdays
TRASH!"
146,ZORDON,146,It worked for six thousand years.
147,IVAN,147,Don't remind me!
148,IVAN,148,"Do you have any idea what it's
like to be cooped up in a rotten
egg for six thousand years?  It's
BORING!  Not to mention I've had
a Charlie horse since the
Renaissance!  But now the tables
are turned.  Now..."
149,IVAN,149,... it's time to pay the PIPER!
150,IVAN,150,"Oh, the things that I have
missed.  The BLACK PLAGUE!"
151,IVAN,151,The SPANISH INQUISITION!
152,IVAN,152,The  70's!
153,IVAN,153,"And now, finally, I have the
strength to DESTROY your pathetic
powers FOREVER!!"
154,ZORDON,154,YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS!
155,IVAN,155,"I've got a NEWS flash for you
LIGHT-BRIGHT -- I ALREADY HAVE!"
156,ALPHA 5,156,"You put your left probe in, you
put your left probe out, you put
your left probe in and you shake
it all about.  You do the hokey-
pokey and you turn yourself
around..."
157,KIMBERLY,157,RAT breath!!
158,KIMBERLY,158,Somebody needs a shave.
159,TOMMY,159,IT'S MORPHIN TIME!
160,KIMBERLY,160,PTERODACTYL!
161,BILLY,161,TRICERATOPS!
162,ROCKY,162,TYRANNOSAURUS!
163,ADAM,163,MASTODON!
164,AISHA,164,SABER TOOTH TIGER!
165,TOMMY,165,WHITE TIGER!
166,RANGERS,166,MORPHENOMENAL!
167,TOMMY,167,"Let's teach these vermin a few
manners."
168,AISHA,168,Activating Power Beam!
169,KIMBERLY,169,Everybody stay alert.
170,ADAM,170,Hold it...
171,ADAM (pointing),171,I heard something over there.
172,BILLY,172,Activating Audio Enhancer!
173,BILLY,173,"They're on the other side of that
wall."
174,TOMMY,174,Anybody see them?
175,ROCKY,175,Activating Power Scope!
176,ROCKY,176,THEY'RE ABOVE US!!
177,AISHA,177,"Hey, handsome!"
178,AISHA,178,My mistake.
179,TOMMY,179,SABA SABER?
180,SABA (yawning),180,What a DREAM I was having!
181,TOMMY,181,We've got company.
182,SABA,182,Rats!  I hate rats!
183,ADAM,183,"Bad move, Willard!"
184,ADAM,184,STEGA-STINGER!
185,ADAM,185,Coming through!
186,ADAM,186,Target Neutralized?
187,KIMBERLY,187,Raptor-Ribbon!
188,KIMBERLY,188,Now you see `em.
189,KIMBERLY,189,Now you don't.
190,BILLY,190,Not the brightest of beasts.
191,SABA,191,Na na na na na!
192,SABA,192,"Fried mice, anyone?"
193,KIMBERLY,193,What's going on?!
194,BILLY,194,"Alpha, come in!"
195,TOMMY,195,We'd better get back.
196,AISHA (worried),196,Something's wrong!
197,TOMMY,197,"Come on, guys..."
198,TOMMY (barely audible),198,... what happened here?...
199,ADAM,199,Guys!
200,BILLY,200,"Alpha, are you okay?!"
201,ALPHA 5,201,"I'll GET you my pretty, and your
little DOG toa!!"
202,BILLY,202,"He must've blown an anitromic
demodulator!"
203,KIMBERLY (stunned),203,"Oh, no..."
204,AISHA,204,... What's happening to him?'
205,BILLY,205,"Outside of his time warp he's
aging at a vastly acellerated
rate!"
206,KIMBERLY,206,We have to help him!
207,ZORDON,207,"...  Rangers... thank goodness
you're safe."
208,TOMMY,208,"We have to get you back inside
your time warp."
209,ZORDON,209,"I'm afraid that's impossible...
The power has been destroyed.
It's gone... The Zords, the
weapons...  all of it."
210,(beat),210,"The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers
are no more."
211,KIMBERLY,211,"Zordon... you can't leave us.
Ever since you came into our
lives... you've been like another
father `to  us  all.-"
212,ZORDON,212,"... You must be strong... Ivan
almost overthrew the planet
once...  and now I'm afraid he
has the strength to see his
scheme through."
213,BILLY,213,what're we going to do?
214,ALPHA 5,214,"I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham!
I do not like them, Sam-I-am!"
215,ALPHA 5,215,Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!!
216,ALPHA 5,216,"Thanks, Billy."
217,ADAM,217,"There has to be something we can
do."
218,TOMMY,218,"Come on, guys, think!"
219,AISHA,219,"Alpha.  Is there any way we can
defeat this  monster?  Any way at
all?"
220,ALPHA 5,220,"... Perhaps there is a way... I
have heard tales of another
power."
221,ADAM,221,What?!
222,ALPHA 5,222,"... They say that somewhere
beyond the Hyperion Constellation
there exists a mythological power
that is beyond all comprehension."
223,TOMMY,223,How can we get to it?
224,ALPHA 5,224,"As the legend goes, the power is
impossible to obtain."
225,ROCKY,225,"We have to try, Alpha.  It's our
only hope."
226,ALPHA 5,226,"It's far too dangerous.  Zordon
would never allow it."
227,AISHA,227,"If we don't try, Zordon won't
survive!"
228,ADAM,228,"If Ivan  Ooze  isn't  stopped,
nobody will survive."
229,ALPHA 5,229,"Ay, yi, yi, yi."
230,(beat),230,"The legend speaks of a Master
Warrior who lives on the planet
Phaedos... This is the only
person who knows the secrets of
the power."
231,AISHA,231,How can we reach Phaedos?
232,ALPHA 5,232,"Zordon's going to have my
orbicular spheroids when he hears
out about this!"
233,ALPHA 5,233,"This is an emergency reserve of
morphonic emissions.  It should
be enough to get -you there."
234,ALPHA 5,234,"There is one problem.  I only
have enough reserve to send you
Phaedos...  I can't bring you
back."
235,ADAM,235,So how do we get back?
236,ALPHA 5,236,"... You'll have to pray that the
legends are true."
237,ALPHA 5,237,"You're sure you want to do this?!
The Rangers share purposeful looks."
238,TOMMY,238,It's our only hope.
239,ALPHA,239,"Safe journey, Rangers!"
240,ALPHA  5,240,BE CAREFUL!!
241,ALPHA 5,241,"Ay, yi, yi, yi.  They're DOOMED!!"
242,RITA (outraged),242,"How could he let them slip
through his hands?!  He's no
better than the rest of the hired
help around here!"
243,GOLDAR,243,"According to the TX Tracker,
they're headed for Phaedos."
244,ZEDD,244,"I'm gonna fire that slimeball so
fast his not gonna know what hit
him!"
245,IVAN,245,"Hi, honey, I'm home !"
246,RITA,246,"You garlic-sucking DINGLEBRAIN!
The Rangers are going after the
Great Power"
247,(to  Zedd),247,"I thought you said this guy was
the Master of Disaster?"
248,(to  Ivan),248,"He's nothing but a slime-
infested, jelly-bellied blob of --"
249,RITA,249,Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
250,ZEDD,250,"How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up
Rita but me!"
251,IVAN,251,"Sorry, slick, there's been a
slight'change of plans."
252,(arms out in trademark stance),252,"The ""booger man"" is taking over."
253,ZEDD,253,"Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd
and lives!"
254,MORDANT,254,"Zedd's gonna kick this snotball
into next week!"
255,IVAN,255,"Ooooh, that tickles!"
256,IVAN,256,My turn.
257,RITA,257,"This is all your fault!  If you'd
taken me out tonight like you
were suposed to, none of this
would've happened."
258,IVAN,258,"Now you have a choice, either
serve me, or join those
insufferable cheesedongs."
259,GOLDAR,259,"We never liked the cheesedongs in
the first place."
260,MORDANT,260,"Couldn''t stand them -- low-class
all the way.  And did you catch
a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's
like having a conversation with
a couple of ONIONS!  Not to
mention..."
261,GOLDAR (apologetic),261,"He's just visiting for the
summer."
262,(beat),262,"Now what about,the Rangers, oh
hideous one?"
263,IVAN,263,"Ah yes, the RANGERS!!!"
264,MORDANT,264,Gasunteidt.
265,IVAN,265,SHUT YOUR BEAKS !!
266,IVAN,266,"Tengu Warriors, you will fly to
Phaedos, find the Power
Rangers...  and TEAR THEM APART!"
267,IVAN,267,"Mordant, go with them and report
back to me!"
268,MORDANT,268,"You know boss, I'd really like to
help out but I've got this
gastronomic condition which rules
out all space trave--"
269,MORDANT,269,IIIIIII!!!
270,ZEDD,270,"Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We
finally do somebody a good turn
and just look what happens!"
271,RITA,271,"From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO
exceptions!"
272,RITA (optional line),272,"It just goes to show, ya never go
into business with a booger."
273,MORDANT,273,Watch the HAIRRRRRRRR!!
274,TOMMY,274,Everybody okay?
275,KIMBERLY,275,Where' s  BILLY? !
276,ALPHA 5,276,"Ay, yi, yi, yi!  The filamentary
transistors have malfunctioned!"
277,ALPHA  5,277,"Why you low-frequency, battery
operated --"
278,BILLY,278,WHOAAAAAAHHHH!!!
279,AISHA,279,BILLY!!
280,KIMBERLY,280,You okay?
281,BILLY,281,I think so.
282,BILLY,282,"This puddle thing is really
getting on my nerves."
283,AISHA,283,"Welcome to beautiful downtown
Phaedos."
284,ROCKY,284,... Incredible...
285,TOMMY,285,"Let's see if we can find this
Master warrior."
286,IVAN,286,"Taking over the world is one
thing.  It's finding good help to
run it for you that's the killer."
287,GOLDAR,287,You want me to place a few calls?
288,IVAN,288,"No need.   I'm going to use the
young minds of Angel Grove."
289,GOLDAR,289,"No offense, boss, but they might
find you a little disgusting."
290,IVAN,290,"Yes, well, I suppose you'd know
a little something about that."
291,(beat),291,"Not to worry.  I'll ever so
gently lure them in and mold them
into an army of devils!  And what
better way to entice them ...
than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!"
292,GOLDAR,292,"But boss, what about their
parents?"
293,IVAN,293,"Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm
going to SCOURGE their puny
minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S.
And then I'll put them to work
rebuilding my empire."
294,SKULL,294,"I understand you're looking for
a few new assistants."
295,BULK,295,"Well put your mind to rest `cause
now you've got the best."
296,IVAN,296,"What is this?!  I advertised for
brilliant and good looking
assistants!"
297,SKULL,297,"Hi, I'm brilliant."
298,BULK (hand extended),298,And I'm good looking.
299,IVAN,299,And I'm Little-Bo-Peep.
300,SKULL,300,"Bulk... why don't we give Mr.
Peep here a chance to think it
over?"
301,BULK,301,"A stellar idea, Skull."
302,IVAN,302,"Not so fast, greaseballs."
303,IVAN,303,You'll have to do.
304,TOMMY,304,Hey.
305,TOMMY,305,You okay?
306,KIMBERLY,306,"I was just thinking about
Zordon...  everything we've been
through together."
307,AISHA,307,"You know, meeting Zordon...
teaming up with you guys, it's
the best thing that's ever
happened to me."
308,ROCKY,308,"It's the best thing that's ever
happened to all of us."
309,ADAM,309,"... He's gonna make it, guys."
310,TOMMY,310,"We'll get this warrior...  save
Zordon...  and send that
SLIMEBALL Ivan Ooze back to the
SEWER he crawled out of."
311,ROCKY,311,TAKE COVER!
312,KIMBERLY,312,THEY'RE T00 STRONG??
313,ADAM,313,WE NEED OUR POWERS!!
314,MORDANT,314,WHAM!  KAPOW!  BOOM!
315,MORDANT,315,#0!@!#!
316,TOMMY,316,"HANG ON, KIMBERLY."
317,MORDANT,317,"What's the matter with you
woodpeckers!  Take this guy out!"
318,MORDANT,318,"The Tengu Warriors my butt!  The
Tengu TURKEYS is more like it!"
319,MORDANT,319,"Hey, aren't you bird-brains
forgetting something?!"
320,MORDANT,320,Watch the meathooks!!
321,KIMBERLY,321,"Wow!  That was amazing for such
a little dude!"
322,FIGURE,322,You're trespassing.
323,(beat),323,Now state your business.
324,TOMMY,324,"We're looking for the Master
Warrior.  Do you know where we
can find him?"
325,FIGURE,325,"The Master Warrior doesn't
entertain visitors  -"
326,KIMBERLY,326,"But we have to find him.  Our
leader Zordon is dying."
327,FIGURE,327,Zordon?
328,DULCEA,328,How did this happen?!
329,KIMBERLY,329,The lady asked you a question.
330,TOMMY,330,"Huh ... Oh, uh, we re, ah..."
331,KIMBERLY,331,"He was attacked by this horrific
being -- Ivan Ooze."
332,DULCEA,332,"Ivan Ooze is free?!  We are all
in mortal danger!"
333,DULCEA,333,Let' s go.
334,AISHA,334,"Kind of bossy, isn't she?"
335,IVAN,335,"Boys and girls, girls and boys,
gather round and feast your eyes.
This ain't sludge and this ain't
guck... this is the one and only
Ivan's Ooze!  Yesireebob.  It's
ooey, gooey and even kind of
chewy.  But best of all it's
FREE!"
336,BULK,336,Here you go!  No pushing!
337,SKULL,337,There's enough for everybody!
338,FRED,338,So where'd this guy come from?
339,SKULL,339,"Uh... that's classified, top
secret, confidential, undercover
information."
340,BULK,340,"If we told you -- we'd have to
kill you."
341,SKULL,341,INCOMING!
342,WIZARD,342,"Come on, come all -- it's an COZE
FREE FOR ALL!"
343,AISHA,343,Is this... food!
344,DULCEA,344,They're called squirbs.
345,KIMBERLY,345,"Mine seems to be a little
undercooked."
346,DULCEA,346,"Add a few dried weevils and
you'll never know the difference."
347,BILLY,347,... Not bad.
348,TOMMY,348,"Listen, we appreciate your
hospitality, but we really don't
have much time."
349,DULCEA,349,"What do you know of the Great
Power?"
350,KIMBERLY,350,"Only that we need it to defeat
Ivan Ooze."
351,DULCEA,351,"It is said that to those who
possess the Power... all things
are possible."
352,BILLY,352,Where did it originate?
353,DULCEA,353,"In another time, another
dimension.  It was brought here
long ago by the ""Nathadians"", a
people who are now all but
extinct.
They built an impenetrable stone
Monolith to store the power and
keep it from their enemies."
354,(ominous),354,"For thousands of years, beings
from all over the Universe have
tried to obtain it... ALL have
perished."
355,AISHA,355,So how can we get to it?
356,DULCEA,356,"The only way to obtain the power
is to achieve the highest state
of being..."
357,TOMMY,357,And how do we do that?
358,DULCEA,358,"By learning the ancient art of
Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of
what you on earth have come to
know as the Ninja."
359,(beat),359,"It is the perfect union of mind,
body and spirit."
360,ROCKY,360,"Look, Zordon doesn't have much
longer to live.  And for all we
know, Angel Grove could already
be under attack.  We don't have
TIME for this."
361,DULCEA,361,"You don't understand.  If you do
not have the Ninjetti, the power
will destroy  you."
362,(beat),362,"To reach the Monolith we must
traverse the Neola jungle.  We
will train today, and set out on
foot tomorrow."
363,SNOGGLE,363,"HNUGLHLU PHUNGLUMP BUGHLSMRPH
GBUJIPHN HUPHLGMPNORU!!!"
364,DULCEA,364,"Snoggle, you watch your language!"
365,SNOGGLE,365,Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?
366,AISHA,366,Excuse me?
367,SNOGGLE,367,Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?
368,DULCEA,368,"He wants to know if you'd like a
cube of sugar in your tea."
369,AISHA,369,Ah... sure.
370,AISHA,370,Ah... thanks.
371,BILLY,371,... Not bad.
372,DULCEA,372,"In the language of the
Nathadians, ""Nin"" stands for
""man"", ""jetti"" stands for
""animal"".  Ninjetti  - man and
animal, together as one."
373,(beat),373,"Now, put your hands inside the
flame."
374,AISHA,374,"Yeah, right."
375,DULCEA,375,It will not harm you.
376,AISHA,376,Just kidding.
377,AISHA,377,Wow.  Sand.
378,DULCEA,378,Now tell me... what do you see?
379,AISHA (bedazzled),379,I see... a bear
380,DULCEA,380,"Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart
and bold."
381,AISHA,381,Stylin'!
382,ROCKY,382,I see... an Ape.
383,DULCEA,383,"Rocky, you are the Mighty Ape."
384,BILLY,384,I see... a fox
385,DULCEA,385,"Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf,
cunning and swift."
386,KIMBERLY,386,I think its some kind of bird.
387,DULCEA,387,"Kimberly, you are the Crane,
agile and sublime."
388,ADAM,388,That's gotta be a frog.
389,DULCEA,389,"Adam, you are the Frog, quick as
lightning."
390,TOMMY,390,It's... an eagle?
391,DULCEA,391,Look closer.
392,TOMMY,392,... A falcon?
393,DULCEA,393,"Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged
Lord of the Sky."
394,KIMBERLY,394,"How do you know so much about the
Ninjetti?"
395,DULCEA,395,"I... am the sole living
descendant of the ""Nathadians""."
396,(beat),396,"Now prepare yourselves for the
most intense physical and mental
training known to man and animal."
397,FRED,397,Dad... ??!
398,FRED,398,DAD?!
399,KID #1,399,You seen my parents?
400,FRED,400,I can't find my dad either.
401,KID #2,401,What's going on?!
402,WILD KID,402,"Ooze, ooze, ooze rules!!"
403,FRED,403,"That guy was the student body
President"
404,DULCEA,404,"The crane maintains it's agility
through the perfect harmony of
mind, body and spirit."
405,KIMBERLY,405,Awesome!
406,KIMBERLY,406,Let's see you do it .
407,SNOGGLE (indignant),407,Ghun Phnug Gnouphl.
408,DULCEA,408,"Snoggle, we don't have time for
you to show off"
409,DULCEA,409,"The ape is strong, but more
importantly it is flexible and
free."
410,ROCKY,410,Who is this lady?
411,ROCKY,411,Here goes!
412,DULCEA,412,"The wolf relies on it's enhanced
senses to guide it...  He can
hear what we cannot hear, he can
smell what we cannot smell."
413,DULCEA,413,"The frog remains still and silent
while it assesses its target...
then strikes out in the blink of
an eye."
414,ADAM,414,Show off.
415,DULCEA,415,"The bear is sturdy as a towering
tree.  Nothing can uproot it."
416,AISHA,416,"Girl, you've got to be kidding
me."
417,DULCEA,417,"The falcon never struggles with
the air, but rather becomes one
with it."
418,DULCEA (calling out),418,JOIN WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE!
419,TOMMY,419,"You can do this.  You can do
this.  You can do this..."
420,ZORDON,420,"... Alpha, I am deeply concerned
about the Rangers..."
421,ALPHA 5,421,"I told them it was too dangerous,
but they wouldn't listen."
422,ZORDON,422,"... We must try to communicate
with them."
423,ALPHA 5,423,"Perhaps if I could locate a
vertical-deflector then I could
assemble a holographic-comlink."
424,ALPHA,424,"Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi ."
425,DULCEA,425,"Each of you must reach deep
within and draw upon your natural
instincts...  Only then will you
know the way of the Ninjetti."
426,(beat),426,"Rest for a few hours.  We will
continue at daybreak."
427,KIMBERLY,427,"So where are we supposed to
sleep?"
428,SNOGGLE,428,Buhph nghujr.
429,KIMBERLY,429,"That guy's cruisin' for a
bruisin'."
430,BILLY,430,I can hardly walk...
431,AISHA,431,"I've never been this sore in my
life."
432,BILLY,432,"Do you guys really think we can
pull this off?"
433,ADAM,433,Maybe if we had more time.
434,TOMMY,434,"... I wonder... We've been
relying on our Morphin Powers for
so long... maybe we've forgotten
how to rely on ourselves."
435,TOMMY,435,We should get some rest.
436,IVAN,436,"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon
says...  STOP!"
437,IVAN,437,Simon says... stand on one foot!
438,IVAN,438,Simon says...
439,GOLDAR,439,Quack like a'duck!
440,GOLDAR,440,It just slipped out.
441,IVAN,441,SHUT UP!!
442,GOLDAR,442,"You didn't say ""Simon says""."
443,IVAN (irritated),443,Simon says SHUT UP!!!
444,IVAN (irritated),444,"Now, as soon as I give the word
I want all of you to start
digging."
445,(beat),445,Do I make myself perfectly --
446,IVAN,446,"This is the Iast time I use
parents for anything!"
447,IVAN,447,"Let's pick it up here!  I've got
a schedule to keep.  In twenty
four hours the ooze is gonna hit
the fan!"
448,GOLDAR,448,"Hey, boss!"
449,MORDANT,449,"What kind of landing was that?!
These clowns are a menace to the
sky"
450,IVAN,450,How did you fare?
451,MORDANT,451,"Oh, it couldn't've gone better.
The Power Rangers didn't know
what hit them ."
452,MORDANT,452,"That's right.  And then we threw
one of them off a mountain and
another one into a raqing river!"
453,IVAN,453,So they've been destroyed?
454,MORDANT,454,"""Basically""."
455,IVAN,455,"What do you mean ""basically""?"
456,MORDANT,456,"Well... we were about to finish
them off... when this huge
monster came out of nowhere!"
457,MORDANT,457,"Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge.
But you should've seen the size
of his STICKS"
458,IVAN,458,"Did these sticks make a whistling
sound?"
459,MORDANT,459,How'd you know?
460,IVAN,460,Dulcea!
461,(beat),461,"That miserable, manipulating
loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!"
462,IVAN,462,"How could you let them get away?!
If Dulcea leads them to the Great
Power, everything will be ruined!
They must be OBLITERATED!"
463,MORDANT,463,"What're you talking about?!  It
wasn't my fault!  You're the
featherbrains that let them get
away!"
464,IVAN,464,"I call upon the Powers of
Darkness to enrich the evil of my
creatures by tenfold!"
465,IVAN,465,"And now the coup de grace, to
lead my tribe to victorious
battle!"
466,MORDANT,466,"Where does he come up with this
stuff?"
467,IVAN,467,"Queen Tengu, lead-your warriors
to Phaedos, FEAST YOURSELVES UPON
THE POWER RANGERS AND BRING ME
DULCEA!"
468,SNOGGLE,468,BUGHU PHUNGL MURHPUGNU!!!
469,TOMMY,469,How the heck?!...
470,ROCKY,470,What's going on?!
471,KIMBERLY,471,I don't believe it!
472,DULCEA,472,"You have been visited by the
animal spirits... they have given
you their blessing."
473,CROWD,473,OOZE!  OOZE!  OOZE!  OOZE!
474,IVAN,474,"Thank you!  Please!  You're too
kind."
475,(sotto voce),475,"Finally. a little appreciation
where it's deserved."
476,VOICE,476,We love you Ivan!
477,IVAN,477,Right back at ya!-
478,(he smiles),478,"Now, WHO MISSES SCHOOL?!"
479,CROWD,479,NOT US!
480,IVAN,480,AND WHO MISSES RULES?!
481,CROWD,481,NOT US!
482,IVAN,482,"AND WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME IN
RAISING HELL ACROSS  THE
UNIVERSE?!"
483,CROWD,483,WE DO!
484,FRED,484,Can I have a word with you guys?
485,(he pulls them aside),485,"What's really going on here?!
Where are everybody's parents?"
486,SKULL,486,"Like we said before, that's
classified, top secret..."
487,FRED,487,"Look, Ivan wants me to go dump a
load of garbage all over them."
488,BULK,488,"Well, why didn't you say so?!"
489,SKULL,489,"They're at the World Center
Construction Site."
490,FRED,490,Uh.   OOZE RULES!
491,BULK AND SKULL,491,OOZE  RULES !
492,TOMMY,492,"Dulcea... how do you and Zordon
know each other?"
493,DULCEA,493,"We belonged to an interstellar
Peace Keeping Force known as the
""Order of the Meledan""."
494,(beat),494,"Zordon was widely regarded as the
finest Commander in the Galaxy.
He was a true Legend... If it
wasn't for him, the Universe
would be a very different place
from what it is today."
495,ROCKY,495,So...  what happened?
496,DULCEA,496,"Over time our enemies were
defeated...  I returned to
Phaedos, Zordon moved on to
continue the struggle elsewhere."
497,(beat),497,"Until you kids showed up, I
hadn't heard from him for
centuries."
498,DULCEA,498,He was always an inspiration...
499,DULCEA,499,"This is why I'm taking you to the
Nathadian Monolith.  That is why
I'm teaching you the Ninjetti."
500,(beat),500,"If Zordon dies... then a piece of
all of us dies... and the force
of good within the Universe will
be dealt an irreparable blow."
501,MORDANT,501,"As soon as we've taken over the
world I'm gonna change my name to
Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR
Mordant?!"
502,GOLDAR,502,How about Major Moron?
503,IVAN,503,"How about the two of you shut Up
and pay attention!!"
504,MORDANT,504,What is THAT!
505,IVAN,505,"Feast your eyes upon the
exoskeleton of the barbaric
HORNITOR!"
506,(to parents),506,"KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL
SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY."

512,MR. KELMAN,512,Dig... dig... dig...
513,MORDANT (O.S.),513,Gotchya!
514,MORDANT,514,Just shut your gap!
515,GOLDAR,515,Did I say anything?
516,ALPHA 5,516,"By bouncing ultra-high
frequencies off one of the
network satellites, I can send a
long-range pulsar signal to
within TWO FEET of the Rangers
coordinates."
517,"ZORDON

late."
518,ALPHA 5,518,Let's give it a whirl.
519,REPORTER,519,"Angel Grove Police have been
fielding hundreds of calls from
concerned citizens as the number

522,IVAN,522,"Are you bored with your work?
Are you bored with your family
Are you bored with your 1ife
Well, come on down to Ooze City
and LET'S GET STICKY!"
523,DULCEA,523,"The Monolith is there in the
distance."
524,DULCEA,524,This is as far as I can take you.
525,KIMBERLY,525,You're leaving us?!
526,DULCEA,526,"I have taught you all that I
know.   Now you must achieve the
Ninjetti on your own."
527,DULCEA,527,"It is said that once you've
reached the power... you have
only ten triacs to release it."
528,BILLY,528,What's a Triac?
529,DULCEA,529,"About twenty seconds in your
time."
530,TOMMY,530,And how do we release the power?
531,DULCEA,531,"The legend goes that you release
the power with the power."
532,ADAM,532,What does that mean!
533,DULCEA,533,"That is a question that even I
cannot answer."
534,(beat),534,"Remember, ten triacs.  After that
something bad will happen."
535,KIMBERLY,535,Like...how bad?
536,DULCEA,536,"They say the power will throw off
a super-heated, radioactive
fireball, instantly reducing you
to ash and bits of charred bone."
537,AISHA,537,That's pretty bad.
