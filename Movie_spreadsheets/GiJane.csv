0,HAYES,0,"... last few years have brought many
advances in the interests of women
in naval service, particularly in
the land-based maritime specialties.
What's more, the Navy has instituted
special sensitivity courses with an
eye on --"
1,DEHAVEN,1,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  ""Land-based
maritime specialties."" Gimme a
second here to de-euphemize that..."
2,DEHAVEN,2,"Would that be anything like
""typing""?  ""Restocking the
cupboards""?  That sort of thing, Mr.
Hayes?"
3,HAYES,3,"Hardly the case, Senator."
4,DEHAVEN,4,"Well, I'm just an old dame without
much time left, so you'll pardon me
if I jump right in here before they
discontinue my blood-type.  I am
deeply concerned over the Navy's
seemingly incontrovertible attitude
toward women in the military.  Case
in point..."
5,DEHAVEN,5,"""The Lark Report."""
6,HAYES,6,"Madam Senator... this is an internal
document of the U.S. Navy.  I must
seriously question whether --"
7,DEHAVEN,7,"The Navy's conclusion regarding the
crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft
carrier.  Female aviator, it just so
happens."
8,DEHAVEN,8,"You're familiar with this report and
its conclusion, am I right?"
9,HAYES,9,"I was one member of the investigating
commission."
10,DEHAVEN,10,"Yes, I see your signature right here
-- twice the size of everyone
else's.  And your conclusion was
""pilot error,"" hmm?"
11,HAYES,11,"I'm really not prepared for any kind
of in-depth review of --"
12,DEHAVEN,12,"I'd like to think our next Secretary
of the Navy would be prepared for
anything, Mr. Hayes."
13,HAYES,13,"The commission concluded that the
aviator in question failed to
execute a proper approach to the
carrier."
14,DEHAVEN,14,"That aside for the moment, I'm
struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit
of your report... the degrading
remarks by other aviators...
innuendo about her performance in
unrelated situations... even a
reference to her sexual activity the
weekend prior."
15,DEHAVEN,15,"In my seven years on this committee,
I've never seen a downed aviator
treated like this.  Never.  I'm
deeply disturbed by this report, Mr.
Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for
women in the military -- but for
your own confirmation as well."
16,DEHAVEN,16,"... a full 35 percent of all jobs in
the U.S. military are still, to this
day, off-limits to women.  And
that's simply gotta change."
17,PRESS #1,17,"What about those who say women
aren't suited for all jobs?  That
they're physically weaker... they
have less stamina..."
18,DEHAVEN,18,"Sure.  And we're gonna hog the
bathroom, too."
19,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,19,"White House boys want a private
meeting."
20,DEHAVEN,20,I'll act surprised.
21,WHITE HOUSE #1,21,"... to reassure you that he has
every faith in the ability of Mr.
Hayes to guide the Navy into the
next century.  The task, as the
Administration sees it, is to
acknowledge changing realities
without losing traditional values."
22,DEHAVEN,22,"'Zat it?  Ten minutes, nothin' on
the table?  Sweetcakes, you best go
back to the President and tell him
to open up the phone book and start
lookin' for his next nominee."
23,WHITE HOUSE #2,23,"Administration's plan for 100
percent integration.  If female
candidates measure up in a series of
test cases, the President will
support full integration within
three years' time."
24,WHITE HOUSE #2,24,"It's your gender-blind Navy,
Senator.  Surely you're not going to
balk now."
25,DEHAVEN,25,"Well, it's just that askin' you all
to integrate the Navy is like
sending a man to do a woman's job."
26,DEHAVEN,26,"How do you propose to handle the
Combat Exclusion Laws?"
27,WHITE HOUSE #2,27,"Keep narrowing the definitions.
Keep redefining."
28,WHITE HOUSE #1,28,We got around it in Saudi Arabia.
29,DEHAVEN,29,"By calling women ""Honorary Men.""
Ingenious."
30,WHITE HOUSE #2,30,"C'mon, Senator, President's pitchin'
right down the center of your plate.
If women measure up to men, they've
got the job.  You going to take a
swing?  Or step out of the box?"
31,HAYES,31,Well?
32,WHITE HOUSE #2,32,"Congratulations, Mr. Secretary."
33,HAYES,33,"So she picks the women, we pick the
programs.  Seals?"
34,FLAG OFFICER #1,34,"I'd go Special Reconnaissance.
Every bit as tough -- and we have a
60 percent drop-out rate among the
men."
35,HAYES,35,Then I suggest we start there.
36,FLAG OFFICER #1,36,"Doesn't matter who she picks.  No
woman is going to last one week in a
commando training course.  And I
don't care who it is."
37,JORDAN,37,Lieutenant O'Neil.
38,ROYCE (V.O.),38,"Gotta situation here.  Where are
you?  Stuck in traffic?"
39,JORDAN,39,"Not due in for 22 minutes, sir.
Watcha got?"
40,ROYCE,40,"All right, stand by, we're going to
switch over to COMSAT..."
41,TACTICAL OFFICER,41,Voice-system now secure...
42,ROYCE,42,"Okay, fresh stuff:  Lost a NATO
plane over the Sea of Japan.  ELB
signals leads us to believe the
pilot is alive and has made his way
to the North Korean shore, near a
fishing village, ""Tamyung."""
43,JORDAN (V.O.),43,"Do we know it's him using the
beacon?  Not a decoy?"
44,ROYCE,44,"Signals received only sparingly, in
such a pattern that leads us to
conclude it is a downed aviator
trying to conserve his batteries."
45,JORDAN (V.O.),45,Chances of recovery?
46,ROYCE,46,"You're the analyst for East China,
O'Neil.  Analyze."
47,JORDAN,47,"North Korean beaches are the best
protected, most heavily monitored in
the world.  The civilian population
is so propagandized that it acts as
an Early Warning system.  Extraction
team has to be small and silent --
I'd go with Seals over Delta Force.
Problem is, don't want to hold a
conventional sub off-shore for
target practice.  Where's The Polk?"
48,ROYCE,48,"Halfway 'round the world.  So that's
the problem -- we can get the team
in, just not out."
49,JORDAN,49,Unless you Whiskey Run.
50,ROYCE,50,"Blank faces here, O'Neil."
51,JORDAN,51,"Quick-hit technique used by Capone.
Rigged a getaway car with running
boards and handles.  All his guys
had to do was jump on and take a
ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 --
I doped it out as a contingency
plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks
up the package, links up with
recovery sub.  But don't waste time
opening and closing hatches.  They
just grab the periscope and hang on
for neutral waters."
52,ROYCE,52,"You expect the extraction team to
ride the sub bare-back?  Is that
correct, O'Neil?"
53,JORDAN,53,"Only four minutes to neutral waters,
sir.  Why not?"
54,ROYCE,54,"All right, sending the
recommendation across the river.
Royce out."
55,JORDAN,55,"No, thank you, sir."
56,ROYCE,56,"That was good headwork, lieutenant."
57,JORDAN,57,"Thank you, sir.  We hear back from
the Pentagon?"
58,ROYCE,58,Probably hear back from CNN first.
59,JORDAN,59,"Hate this part.  Just sweating it
out on the sidelines."
60,ROYCE,60,"Intel has its own glory, lieutenant
-- no matter how subtle."
61,ROYCE,61,"By the way, I'll need that option
paper by 11-hundred today so I can
review it with Admiral Hanover.  And
do we have any of that breakfast tea
around here?"
62,JORDAN,62,"Is this my glory, sir?"
63,N.I.C. SECRETARY,63,"Excuse me, but I have Senator
DeHaven on the line for you."
64,ROYCE,64,"Jesus God, what now?"
65,N.I.C. SECRETARY,65,"I'm sorry, sir no -- she asked to
speak with Lieutenant O'Neil."
66,DEHAVEN,66,"So everyone I talk to says you're
top drawer with silk stockings
inside."
67,JORDAN (V.O.),67,"Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask
what this is regarding?"
68,DEHAVEN,68,"High-school pentathlete... ROTC
scholarship, graduated with
honors... top marks in Basic
Training... and, as it just so
happens, a constituent of my home
state of Virginia.  Oh, the things
I'll do for one extra vote."
69,DEHAVEN,69,"Lieutenant O'Neil, I am prepared to
nominate you for the Navy's Special
Reconnaissance program.  Should you
accept, you'll ship out to Coronado
next week and join in the big
testosterone festival.  Complete the
course, and you'll have a fast
ticket to any assignment you want.
That's my personal promise to you."
70,JORDAN,70,"""Coronado."""
71,DEHAVEN,71,California.
72,JORDAN,72,"I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just
that... Beggin' your pardon,
Senator, but... do you understand
that this involves combat training?"
73,DEHAVEN,73,"This is just a test case, O'Neil.
But if it works out -- if you work
out -- it could well change the
Navy's official policy on women in
combat.  Or, actually, its official
non-policy.  Now who's your
immediate superior there?"
74,JORDAN,74,Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
75,DEHAVEN,75,"My office will fill him in and help
expedite.  Look forward to meeting
you at the proper time.  Jumping off
now..."
76,JORDAN,76,"Uh, question, ma'am."
77,DEHAVEN,77,"Yes, dear."
78,JORDAN,78,"Would I be the only one?  The only
woman?"
79,DEHAVEN,79,"There'll be more to follow -- but
yes, dear, right now you're the pick
of a very large litter.  And your
success would mean a lot.  Jumping,
now..."
80,JORDAN,80,"Well, shit-a-doodle-do..."
81,JORDAN (O.S.),81,"... well, I survived Basic Training
and three brothers -- so I know how
to fight.  What scares me are the
sexual politics.  I don't want to be
turned into some poster girl for
women's rights."
82,ROYCE,82,"So why're you even considering it?
Are you?"
83,JORDAN,83,Just like you would be.
84,ROYCE,84,"Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world-
class warriors.  And they will not
want you there, Jordan."
85,JORDAN,85,I take it you don't either.  Feet.
86,ROYCE,86,"Well, you're doin' shit-hot at
Intel."
87,JORDAN,87,"Royce.  We're the same age, we
started the same time -- and now
you're sitting in the upperdecks
while I'm still down in the bullpen.
What does that tell you about the
Navy?"
88,ROYCE,88,She's haze grey and underway...
89,JORDAN,89,"You need operational duty to really
advance... you need combat training
to go operational... yet combat
training is off-limits to people
with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel.
Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm
beating my head on a big brass
ceiling."
90,ROYCE,90,So dump on me.
91,JORDAN,91,This has nothing to do with you.
92,ROYCE,92,"Well, guess I don't even need to be
here..."
93,JORDAN,93,"Get your dick back here.  It has
everything to do with you."
94,ROYCE,94,"You're such a ball-breaker
sometimes.  Especially at night."
95,JORDAN,95,Sorry.  But after our days...
96,JORDAN,96,"So if I try this thing... if I ship
out to Coronado... what happens
here?"
97,ROYCE,97,"I'll try to keep the door open.  If
you wash out, I make it so that --"
98,JORDAN,98,"Wai', wait.  What happens if it
works?  Four months of training,
three years of operational duty.
What then?"
99,ROYCE,99,"I don't feel like doing an option
paper on the rest of my life,
Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it
happen."
100,JORDAN,100,Which is guy-speak for...
101,ROYCE,101,"Sounded lame as soon as it came out
of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be
honest, okay?  Three years is a long
time.  Don't ask me to predict how
I'll feel then, Jordan, because I
don't know.  And either do you."
102,JORDAN,102,"You know, right up until you said
that -- I thought I did know."
103,ROYCE,103,Jordan...
104,JORDAN,104,"Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up
like such a tough call -- and then
you go and make it so goddamn easy.
Really, thank you so much."
105,JORDAN,105,"Excuse me, lieutenant.  I was told
this is where I check in."
106,DUTY OFFICER,106,So you're the one.
107,JORDAN,107,"Still don't have my bearings yet.
Direct me to the officer's quarters?"
108,DUTY OFFICER,108,"You'll proceed directly to the
infirmary for eye tests, blood
tests, urinalysis, pregnancy test.
Uniform issue adjacent.  Then you're
to report to the Base Commander.
He'd like a word with you."
109,JORDAN,109,Fine.  And the officer's quarters?
110,DUTY OFFICER,110,"C.O.'s office can supply you with
directions.  Enjoy your visit,
lieutenant."
111,BLONDELL,111,"B.O.Q., south side.  Take a
starboard tack out the door."
112,JORDAN,112,"Thank you, ensign."
113,BLONDELL,113,"No problem, lieutenant."
114,C.O.,114,Come.
115,YEOMAN,115,"Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil reporting,
sir."
116,C.O.,116,"Yes, of course.  Please, have a
seat, lieutenant..."
117,JORDAN,117,"Thank you, sir."
118,C.O.,118,Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
119,JORDAN,119,"I'm fine, sir."
120,C.O.,120,"So.  We're still coming to terms
with the exact protocol for this --
for integrating the Spec-Recon
training.  It may not always be
smooth, but we're trying to make it
as painless as possible for you."
121,JORDAN,121,"Thank you, sir.  But I expect a
certain amount of pain."
122,JORDAN,122,"Barber was my next stop, sir.
Would've had it regulation sooner,
only --"
123,C.O.,123,"Don't worry about it.  If it's off
your collar and out of your eyes,
that's all I'm going to ask."
124,JORDAN,124,"Really, I have no problem with --"
125,C.O.,125,"I'm not out to change your sex,
lieutenant.  You'll have separate
beds, separate heads.  If you have
specific medical needs, inform the
infirmary.  If a classmate or
superior acts in an harassing or
otherwise unbecoming manner, please
inform me immediately so I can deal
with it immediately.  Questions?"
126,JORDAN,126,"None at this time, sir."
127,C.O.,127,"Then that's all I have to say.
Dismissed."
128,JORDAN,128,"Sir, I just want you to know... I'm
not here to make a statement.  I
don't want to make men look foolish.
All I care about is completing the
training and getting operational
experience -- just like everyone
else, I suspect."
129,C.O.,129,"If you were like everyone else,
lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be
making statements about not making
statements, would we?"
130,C.O.,130,Take your leave.
131,MILLER,131,What am I scannin' here?
132,C.O.,132,"Special Reconnaissance.  Here you
will be trained to infiltrate
hostile territory... to be the real-
time eyes on the ground... to
recover assigned targets and, if
need be, to fight your way out under
adverse conditions."
133,C.O.,133,"That is all that will be said about
the special nature of this class --
by us or by you.  Many of you have
waited years for admission to this
program.  Opportunities like this
are rare -- and those who seize upon
them are rarer still."
134,C.O.,134,"Other than that, there is little to
be said but ""Good luck, gentleman."""
135,C.O.,135,"""Gentlepersons."""
136,C.O.,136,"Now I turn you over to the chief
training officer.  He has earned six
naval commendations, the purple
heart, and the Navy Cross for
heroism and valor.  I give you
Master Chief John James Urgayle."
137,THE CHIEF,137,"The sun and moon... the ebb and flow
of the Pacific tides... global
warming... the very angle of the
Earth upon its axis... these are
just some of the things I control in
my world."
138,MCCOOL,138,We're fucked.
139,SLUTNIK,139,Darth Vader reads poetry...
140,MCCOOL,140,We are so fucked.
141,INSTRUCTOR,141,"Count down... one, two... count
down... three, four..."
142,CLASS CADENCE,142,"One, two, three, four... One, two,
three, four..."
143,THE CHIEF,143,"You may think that you are the
brightest, the best, the strongest.
I assure you, that is a total
delusion on your part.  It is my job
to show you just how weak human
beings can truly be.  60 percent of
you will not finish this course.
How do I know?  Because that is an
historical fact."
144,THE CHIEF,144,Poles down.
145,THE CHIEF,145,"Now for the bad new:  I always like
to get one quitter on the first day.
And until I do, the first day does
not end.  So look around right now
-- go on, do it.  I wonder who it's
gonna be..."
146,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,146,Down to BVDs!
147,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,147,"Now face the Pacific... link arms...
and take a stroll!"
148,STAMM,148,"What is it with the damn phone
poles?  We sign up for Spec-Recon or
GTE?"
149,WICKWIRE,149,"Just trying to thin the herd.
That's all they want to do right
now."
150,SLUTNIK,150,"Man.  Doesn't she know it's rude to
point?"
151,NEWBERRY,151,Wow.  You see that girl?
152,WICKWIRE,152,"I got eyes, Newberry."
153,SLUTNIK,153,"One night.  Just one night in my
room, she'd forget all about playin'
commando."
154,ENGLAND,154,"Tone that shit down, Slutnik.  You
heard with they said."
155,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,155,Out of the water!
156,THE CHIEF,156,"Now make like sugar cookies and roll
in the sand for me."
157,THE CHIEF,157,"Collect those poles, gentlemen.
Still a lotta beachfront you haven't
seen..."
158,ENGLAND,158,How bad?  Stamm?
159,JORDAN,159,We better get a medic over --
160,STAMM,160,"No, goddamnit.  No."
161,INSTRUCTOR,161,Up!  Up!  Up!  Up!
162,THE CHIEF,162,"Pain is your friend.  You ally.  It
will keep you awake in times of
emergency... it will tell you when
you are seriously injured... it will
keep you angry and remind you to
finish the job and get the hell
home.  But you know the best thing
about pain?"
163,CLASS,163,"No, sir!"
164,THE CHIEF,164,"It lets you know that you aren't
dead yet."
165,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,165,"Go regulation if you can't do the
reverses, O'Neil."
166,JORDAN,166,"Thank you, sir.  But I like these
just fine."
167,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,167,"Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil."
168,JORDAN,168,"I'll try anyway, sir."
169,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,169,"You'll try what we tell you to try,
O'Neil.  Go regulation."
170,THE CHIEF,170,"Who's it gonna be.  I just wonder,
who is it gonna be..."
171,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,171,"On your belly... on your back... on
your feet... on your belly... on
your back... on your feet..."
172,THE CHIEF,172,"You have noticed a ship's bell
hanging at the west side of this
courtyard.  If, at any time, you
feel you cannot continue with your
training -- that bell is your
salvation.  Strike it three times,
and the ordeal is over."
173,THE CHIEF,173,"Yes, it is a long walk.  So I'll
make it as easy as I can."
174,THE CHIEF,174,"Now you don't have to watch me
watching you break rank.  Because I
know someone here wants to do it."
175,THE CHIEF,175,Now I know what you're thinking...
176,SLUTNIK,176,"I'm thinkin' we could jump him right
now..."
177,THE CHIEF,177,"""Can I really take 15 weeks of this
bubonic asshole?""  If you don't know
the answer to that question, the
answer is ""No, you cannot.""  And
that is another historical fact.  So
do it.  Admit you don't have what it
takes... admit you are out of your
depth -- or we're all heading back
to the beach right now."
178,THE CHIEF,178,Instructors!  Time hack!
179,THE CHIEF,179,"Six... five... four... three...
two... one... HACK!"
180,THE CHIEF,180,"The time is now 12-hundred.  The sun
is shining brightly.  Plenty of
daylight left for another phone-pole
run..."
181,THE CHIEF,181,"Leave your helmet there, Stamm.
Back to the barracks."
182,THE CHIEF,182,"The rest of you should remember one
thing.  The only easy day was today.
Lieutenant Wickwire?  Turning it
over to you."
183,WICKWIRE,183,"Cuh-lass, face right!"
184,ENGLAND,184,"Better look elsewhere, O'Neil."
185,SLUTNIK,185,"Half a night, Lord, just gimme half
a night to set her straight..."
186,MILLER,186,"Average woman is 25 percent body
fat.  That's one-quarter fat, man.
Think about that."
187,MCCOOL,187,"Nice distribution, though."
188,MILLER,188,"No way does she makes this program.
No way."
189,VOICE,189,"It's not so much that they hate
you..."
190,WICKWIRE,190,They're more afraid of you.
191,JORDAN,191,"Well, now I feel so much better."
192,WICKWIRE,192,"It was made clear before you came --
harassment equals career suicide.
Can't say anything good, so they
don't say much at all.  To your
face, anyway."
193,JORDAN,193,Whose orders were those?
194,WICKWIRE,194,It was made clear.
195,WICKWIRE,195,"Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's
hell, then it levels out.  Until
S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's
hell-and-a-half."
196,JORDAN,196,And how do you know that?
197,WICKWIRE,197,Made it to Week 10 last time.
198,JORDAN,198,"I didn't know they let you try
again.  Especially at your age."
199,WICKWIRE,199,You're kind of a surprise yourself.
200,THE CHIEF,200,"England, 88 seconds.  You're good to
go for the slide-for-life.
Wickwire, roll back till you get
south of 90."
201,WICKWIRE,201,Fuck.  Yes sir.
202,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,202,"Who'd you kiss to get back in here,
anyway?"
203,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,203,"Hang on, here..."
204,CORTEZ,204,"Aw, what is this..."
205,JORDAN,205,Sir...
206,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,206,"Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but
it's gotta go out."
207,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,207,Five... four... three...
208,JORDAN,208,I can make this wall without --
209,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,209,... two... one... MARK!
210,CLASS,210,"Lesgo, Cortez, LESGO, GO, GO!"
211,CORTEZ,211,Shit of a saint...
212,CLASS,212,"Take her, take her here, Cortez...
lookit that monkey-man go... hoo-
yah, hoo-yah..."
213,THE CHIEF,213,"Cortez, 93 seconds.  O'Neil, 94.
Cortez, do a little rescue-recovery
on your gonads and line up again.
O'Neil... move ahead."
214,JORDAN,214,"Say again, sir?"
215,THE CHIEF,215,You heard me.  Move on.
216,CORTEZ,216,"Aw, this is such bullshit..."
217,JORDAN,217,"Chief, sir, I don't understand
why --"
218,THE CHIEF,218,"Educate her, Pyro."
219,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,219,"Automatic five-second deduction,
which slips you under the wire.
It's called ""gender-norming,"" O'Neil
-- standard procedure for all
females in physical training
courses.  Where you been the last
few years?"
220,JORDAN,220,"What ""all females""?  If I'm the
only --"
221,THE CHIEF,221,"Twice now, I have said the words
""move on."""
222,SLUTNIK,222,"Can't live with them, can't kill
them.  What's the point?"
223,MCCOOL,223,"Somebody throw a tent over this
circus."
224,WICKWIRE,224,"Just let it go.  If it's in your
favor, just shut the hell up and
take it."
225,JORDAN,225,"Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told
me to come to you immediately if I
felt I was being mistreated in any
way."
226,C.O.,226,Didn't take long.
227,C.O.,227,"All right, lieutenant, give me a
name and specifics, I'll have the
X.O. file an action first thing in
the morning."
228,C.O.,228,A name?
229,JORDAN,229,"It's you, sir.  And it started the
day I came here."
230,C.O.,230,"Oh, really."
231,JORDAN,231,"It's this double-standard, the
separate quarters, the deferential
treatment.  It's how you pulled out
my chair and nearly served high tea
the first time we met."
232,C.O.,232,"Because I was civil, now you're
complaining."
233,JORDAN,233,"I can't afford civility, sir.  How
am I supposed to fit in with these
guys when you've got me set up as an
outsider?  Even if I make it under
these rules, I still lose, because
there'll always be a flag in my file
-- ""Yeah, she made it, but...""  I
mean, really -- why didn't you just
issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear
around the base?"
234,C.O.,234,Did you just have a brain-fart?
235,JORDAN,235,Pardon?
236,C.O.,236,"Did you just barge in here and curse
at your base commander?  If so, I
regard that as a bonafide brain-
fart, and I resent it when people
fart inside my home."
237,JORDAN,237,"I think you've resented me from the
start, sir."
238,C.O.,238,"What I resent, lieutenant, is some
politician using my base as a test
tube for her grand social
experiment.  What I resent is the
sensitivity training that is now
mandatory for my men... the day-care
center I have to build where an
officer's lounge used to be... and
the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff
just so someone can keep track of
your personal pap smears."
239,C.O.,239,"But most of all, lieutenant, I
resent your perfume, however subtle
it may be, competing with the aroma
of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty-
nine cent cigar, which I will
happily put out this very instant if
the phallic nature of it happens to
offend your goddamn fragile
sensibilities.  DOES IT?"
240,JORDAN,240,"No, sir."
241,C.O.,241,"No, sir, WHAT?"
242,JORDAN,242,"The shape doesn't bother me.  It's
just that goddamn rotten stench."
243,C.O.,243,"Well.  'Least now we're talking the
same language."
244,C.O.,244,"So one standard.  Is that what
you're after?"
245,JORDAN,245,"Same rules for everyone, sir."
246,C.O.,246,Straight up?
247,JORDAN,247,"Across the board, sir."
248,C.O.,248,"And if you just happen to wash out,
I won't have to contend with you
bitchin' to some hairy-chested
female Senator?  And please note I
did not identify any one in
particular."
249,JORDAN,249,"Wouldn't dream of it, sir."
250,C.O.,250,Then good night.
251,JORDAN,251,So I'll get a fair shot?
252,C.O.,252,"You'll get everything you want,
O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what
you're gonna get."
253,BLONDELL,253,This some kind of joke?
254,SLUTNIK,254,"Well, who the shit you think you
are?  Comin' in here like that?"
255,JORDAN,255,Your new roommate.
256,JORDAN,256,Anybody usin' these drawers here?
257,SLUTNIK,257,"Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You
can't stay in here.  You can't sleep
right next to me."
258,JORDAN,258,"Funny, the C.O. says I can."
259,SLUTNIK,259,"Aw, lookit this, lookit this --
she's bringin' Tampax in here.
C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms
over there."
260,JORDAN,260,That your desk?  I'll take this one.
261,SLUTNIK,261,WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
262,JORDAN,262,"Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay.
And if you don't want me for a
roommate or classmate, you got two
options -- move out or ring out.
End of file."
263,JORDAN,263,"What about you, McCool?  Any problem
with the room assignment?"
264,MCCOOL,264,"""It's not a job -- it's an
adventure."""
265,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,265,"58 degrees this morning!  That's not
a bad water temp, really -- if
you're standing where we are!"
266,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,266,"Slurred speech, lack of proper motor
control, short-term amnesia -- all
early signs of hypothermia!
Advanced hypothermia is easy to
detect in a classmate!  He'll look
like he's dead!"
267,THE CHIEF,267,"Body heat.  In situations of extreme
cold, you can always count on body
heat to keep you alive -- and I do
not mean your own.  We will break
you of the cultural barriers that
dictate you should not invade
another man's space.  Are any of you
in a situation of extreme cold right
now?"
268,CLASS,268,"Yes, sir!"
269,THE CHIEF,269,"Then why aren't you all over the man
next to you?"

271,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,271,"If you can't feel the other guy's
pecker, you ain't in tight enough!
I want nuts to butts!"
272,JORDAN,272,"Come on, Montgomery..."
273,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,273,"Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break
in that line?"
274,JORDAN,274,"Montgomery, why do they call you
""Flea""?"
275,FLEA,275,"It's really ""F. Lee Montgomery"" --
but that gets whittled down to just
""Flea.""  For short, ma'am."
276,JORDAN,276,"So it really has nothing to do with
actual brain size?"
277,FLEA,277,"No, ma'am."
278,JORDAN,278,"Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect
you just showed me.  But I don't
need it and don't want it -- not
that kind of respect, anyway.  It's
just gonna hurt us both, okay?"
279,FLEA,279,"I'll work on it, ma'am."
280,JORDAN,280,Do that.
281,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,281,Time.
282,THE CHIEF,282,"Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast."

want to continue, Instructor Johns

296,MCCOOL,296,"Wick!  They really got donuts over
there?  Or just some'a last night's
dinner rolls?"

their viscera hanging from tree
limbs.  Israeli men would linger
over wounded females -- often to the

don't use women anymore."

he's gone soft."

man clear, lieutenant?"

unit cohesion.  Men fight better
without women around.  And that is
an historical fact."

437,JORDAN,437,"I don't know if there's any single
reason.  But my father was Navy.
And he had this old-time recruiting
poster in his den.  It showed a girl
trying on a sailor's uniform while
saying, ""Gee, I wish I were a man!
I'd join the Navy!""  Was maybe 10
years old when I first saw it, and
even then it felt wrong.  Made me
mad.  And I don't think a month has
gone by that I haven't thought about
that poster.  ""Gee, I wish I were a
man."""
438,BLONDELL,438,I've been accused of that wish.
439,JORDAN,439,The woman I saw you with...
440,BLONDELL,440,"Just a friend.  We have friends,
too, you know."
441,JORDAN,441,"But are there... I mean, how many..."
442,BLONDELL,442,"More than you'd guess.  It's just
that we don't hold coffee klatches.
If more then three of us get
together at any one time, the guys
think it's some kind of uprising."
443,BLONDELL,443,"Sounds funny now, but it's really
not.  We have to be careful.  The
Navy still knows how to put on a
witch-hunt."
444,JORDAN,444,Royce...
445,ROYCE,445,"I've been trying you for five days.
Don't they give you messages?"
446,JORDAN (V.O.),446,"It's hard to find time to sleep,
Royce.  Much less keep up with my
phone life."
447,ROYCE,447,How hard they making it on you?
448,ROYCE (V.O.),448,That bad?
449,JORDAN,449,"I feel like there's men here,
there's women here -- then there's
men.  But hey, what'd I expect?"
450,ROYCE,450,"Well, not this.  I was doing the
Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got
some fresh stuff -- about you.  You
may be in a hostile camp.  I think
someone may be taking steps to
ensure that you crash and burn."
451,JORDAN,451,Me?  Why me?
452,ROYCE,452,"Don't you know?  How they're talking
about you?"
453,JORDAN,453,I saw an article...
454,ROYCE,454,"I can't walk two blocks in
Washington without hearing about
""G.I. Jane.""  You're all over the
place, and whether you wanted it or
not, the feminists are sizing you up
for that poster."
455,JORDAN,455,So why are you telling me this?
456,ROYCE,456,"Big symbols make big targets,
Jordan.  I think someone's gunning
for you."
457,JORDAN,457,"You know, Royce, I got enough heat
on me without you turning up the
jets, too."
458,ROYCE,458,"I'm only trying to warn you in
case --"
459,JORDAN,459,"Well, let me warm you:  I'm going
though with this.  The more
everybody fucks with me, fucks with
my head, the more it just makes me
want to finish.  So don't expect me
back crying in your arms any time
soon, okay?"
460,ROYCE,460,"That's not what I want, Jordan.  I
mean... it is and it isn't..."
461,JORDAN,461,"Still can't make up your mind, huh?
Gotta go, Royce."
462,ROYCE,462,Jordan.  You watch your ass.
463,JORDAN,463,Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
464,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,464,"Infiltrate... establish your hide-
site... record any movement of
troops, vehicles, patrols -- any
activity inside your scan.  If you
are compromised, you have two
options!  Newberry!"
465,NEWBERRY,465,"Evasive maneuvers or radio for
emergency extraction, sir!"
466,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,466,"If you are extracting, be damn sure
to follow procedures you have
learned in your classroom training!
A helo cannot extract you from a
wooded area!  You must bring it down
in a clearing!  What's the minimum
clearance for an MH-60 Black Hawk,
McCool?"
467,MCCOOL,467,"32 feet, six inches, sir!"
468,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,468,"You will be penalized for early
extraction, but you will be
penalized more for capture -- trust
me, far more!  Survival!  Evasion!
Rescue!  Evacuation!  Welcome to
S.E.R.E.!"
469,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,469,Lieutenant!  Don't back down!
470,SLUTNIK,470,"Feel right at home, McCool?"
471,JORDAN,471,"South-southeast.  And I don't want
to hear another word till we're
underground."
472,MCCOOL,472,"Got two FAVs moving south.  I
make... four banditos aboard,
carrying... H-60 machine guns..."
473,JORDAN,473,"Newberry, get a photo.  South?"
474,CORTEZ,474,Entering my scan now...
475,JORDAN,475,West?
476,SLUTNIK,476,Clear.
477,JORDAN,477,North?
478,FLEA,478,Clear.
479,CORTEZ,479,FAVs clear.
480,MCCOOL,480,You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
481,SLUTNIK,481,So am I.
482,CORTEZ,482,Anyone?
483,FLEA,483,"Don't wanna evacuate 'cuz someone
came down with uric poisoning, el-
tee."
484,JORDAN,484,"Didn't even bitch about the seat,
did I?"
485,MCCOOL,485,"What the... Got an unknown here.
100 yards north-northeast."
486,MCCOOL,486,She part of the training?
487,JORDAN,487,I don't know...
488,SLUTNIK,488,"""She?""  There's another one?"
489,MCCOOL,489,Shit.  Think we're had.
490,CORTEZ,490,Smoke her.
491,MCCOOL,491,I ain't gonna shoot her.
492,CORTEZ,492,Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
493,MCCOOL,493,"Hey.  Ain't your call, man."
494,JORDAN,494,"Pri One is to protect the mission.
If she represents a real threat, we
have to do it."
495,JORDAN,495,"But did she see us?  Do you know for
a fact that we are compromised?"
496,JORDAN,496,"If not, firing will only give away
our position to hostiles in the
area.  Now how smart is that?"
497,MCCOOL,497,Mighta been civilian.
498,NEWBERRY,498,"They got regular peeps on this
island, don't they?"
499,CORTEZ,499,"Banditos on the east perimeter!  150
yards!  Shit, she was part of it!"
500,MCCOOL,500,Fuck me.
501,FLEA,501,"What's the word, el-tee?  We're
about one minute from a major take-
down here."
502,JORDAN,502,"All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers.
Drop everything but weapons and the
PRC radio -- we're gonna be high
speed, low drag all the way to the
link-up site.  Ready?"
503,SLUTNIK,503,Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
504,JORDAN,504,MOVE!
505,SLUTNIK,505,This ain't workin' right!
506,MCCOOL,506,"What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?"
507,SLUTNIK,507,This ain't even workin' wrong!
508,FLEA,508,"Really don't wanna be captured, el-
tee.  Heard some bad things."
509,JORDAN,509,Fuck.
510,JORDAN,510,"Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew
Six requesting emergency extraction.
Stand by for a PRC fix..."
511,MCCOOL,511,"32 feet, six inches!"
512,JORDAN,512,"I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!"
513,JORDAN,513,'Cool?
514,MCCOOL,514,Smoke it!
515,FLEA,515,"Where are you... HEY!  Where are you
taking her?"
516,JORDAN,516,How long?
517,JORDAN,517,"Please, HOW LONG?"
518,JORDAN,518,"""Don't know how much I can take""...
""A little taste of death""... ""Save
the nail""..."
519,JORDAN,519,"""It's been three days now""..."
520,JORDAN,520,Who is it?
521,WICKWIRE (O.S.),521,"You know, I had an apartment about
this size once."
522,JORDAN,522,"Wick.  They got your crew, too?"
523,WICKWIRE (O.S.),523,"Intagliata was out chasing
breakfast.  They found his tracks.
Well, shit."
524,JORDAN,524,"You really came back for more?  Of
this?"
525,WICKWIRE (O.S.),525,"When I was sittin' behind a desk in
Washington, it made sense, somehow.
Blame it on my big brother.  He was
Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used
to tell..."
526,JORDAN,526,"If you got a good one, Wick..."
527,WICKWIRE,527,"One time he was doing a rekkie of
the Libyan coastline.  This is,
like, right before we bombed
Khadaffi into the past tense.  So
his crew does a nighttime infil,
maps all the big artillery
placements and stuff, then turns
around to get the hell gone.  But
between them and the water are five
Libyan guards, all armed to the
nuts."
528,JORDAN,528,They had to kill 'em?
529,WICKWIRE,529,"Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But
on every guard's chest,they left one
Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little
calling card to say they'd been
there -- and could come back any
time they wanted."
530,JORDAN,530,That's a good story.
531,WICKWIRE,531,"So the shit you gotta go through?
To get from here to there?  Brother
said it was worth it.  Worth the
training... worth the divorce...
worth anything."
532,JORDAN,532,He was married?
533,WICKWIRE,533,At first.
534,JORDAN,534,"You got anybody, Wick?"
535,WICKWIRE,535,Not me.  You?
536,WICKWIRE,536,O'Neil?
537,JORDAN,537,"How'd you make it last time, Wick?
How'd you get through this part?"
538,WICKWIRE,538,Last time I didn't.
539,JORDAN,539,"Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep
talkin' to me..."
540,ROYCE,540,Suitable for framing...
541,ROYCE,541,Got time for a brain-pick?
542,THE SPOOK,542,Subject?
543,ROYCE,543,"O'Neil, Jordan."
544,THE SPOOK,544,Thought you two were file-closed.
545,ROYCE,545,You knew about us?
546,THE SPOOK,546,Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
547,ROYCE,547,"Computer -- no transcription, no
com-link, no data-link.  In fact...
shut-down sequence 0-Niner-0-8,
mark."
548,THE SPOOK,548,"All right.  So who stands to gain if
Jordan flames out in a big way?"
549,ROYCE,549,"The E-Ringers?  Full integration is
gonna cost the services billions at
the worst possible time -- when
Congress is already swinging the
axe."
550,THE SPOOK,550,"Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But
Pentagon's a big place.  Let's
narrow the sights."
551,ROYCE,551,"The Navy?  They've made it clear
they don't want to pull missiles out
of subs to make room for women's
heads.  What's it gonna cost to make
a fleet of Trident's co-ed?"
552,THE SPOOK,552,"Sabotage born of economics?
Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes
really going to start his watch with
such a public failure?"
553,ROYCE,553,Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
554,THE SPOOK,554,Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
555,THE SPOOK,555,"The White House.  If Jordan wins,
DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well,
it's been said that the only man the
President fears -- ain't no man."
556,ROYCE,556,The first female President?
557,THE SPOOK,557,"Don't for a second think she didn't
leak this story.  ""G.I. Jane"" gives
DeHaven a symbol that taps into the
biggest constituency of them all."
558,ROYCE,558,Women.
559,THE SPOOK,559,"If you were the President, wouldn't
that put a little piss in your
shoes?"
560,ROYCE,560,I don't know.  Seems...
561,THE SPOOK,561,"This ain't about some little soldier
girl sloggin' her way through
commando school.  The implications
go way beyond."
562,ROYCE,562,"Christ, I don't want to see her take
a fall.  She thinks I do, but..."
563,THE SPOOK,563,I take it this file is still open.
564,ROYCE,564,"Even tough I don't talk to her every
day -- I still talk to her every
day.  Know what I mean?"
565,THE SPOOK,565,"Okay, so now work it from the other
end.  Think about California -- and
how things might be handled there."
566,ROYCE,566,I don't...
567,ROYCE,567,"What, someone on base?  A ""mole""?"
568,THE SPOOK,568,"This is what you get for brain-
picking an old CIA spook.  but if I
needed to control the outcome of
this test case, that's how I'd do
it.  A man-in-place.  Makes
everything very controllable."
569,THE CHIEF,569,What is your father's name?
570,THE CHIEF,570,"Simple question, lieutenant.  No
reason not to answer.  What is your
father's name?"
571,JORDAN,571,"""Dad."""
572,THE CHIEF,572,Any brothers?  Sisters?
573,JORDAN,573,"Dick, Jane, and Spot."
574,THE CHIEF,574,"Are you hungry?  What's your
favorite food?  We'll try to get it
for you."
575,JORDAN,575,"Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not
going to get anywhere.  You might as
well put me in the cage."
576,THE CHIEF,576,"You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right
here, right now."
577,JORDAN,577,Should I be afraid?
578,THE CHIEF,578,"Right down to your worthless womb,
and I'll tell you why.  This is my
island.  My world.  And here I can
get away with shit that would get me
arrested anywhere else in the world.
Take another scan of my little joy-
boy outside.  If I can do that to a
Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to
you?  Huh?"
579,THE CHIEF,579,"Why didn't you shoot the woman,
O'Neil?"
580,JORDAN,580,Wasn't deemed a threat.
581,THE CHIEF,581,"She led us right to you.  That's no
threat?"
582,THE CHIEF,582,Would you have shot if it was a man?
583,JORDAN,583,"No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --"
584,THE CHIEF,584,"The others already told me, O'Neil.
They wanted to shoot, but you
wouldn't let them.  Because you went
soft on another women --"
585,JORDAN,585,That's not right.
586,THE CHIEF,586,"That's what your crew said.  Are
they lying?  Or are you?"
587,JORDAN,587,I think you're the liar.
588,THE CHIEF,588,"I'm not the one who got five good
men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You
wear the bars, you made the call,
and you got your whole crew --"
589,JORDAN,589,"We didn't know we were compromised.
Firing would only've given away our
position."
590,THE CHIEF,590,"You think we should go easy on
women, O'Neil?"
591,THE CHIEF,591,Do you?
592,JORDAN,592,No.
593,THE CHIEF,593,I'm so glad we agree.
594,THE CHIEF,594,"Didn't you know you'd be raped if
you were captured?  Didn't you even
think about that?"
595,JORDAN,595,Sure.  Just like your men do.
596,THE CHIEF,596,"I think we oughtta practice it,
just so you know what to expect."
597,JORDAN,597,"Should I practice bleeding, too,
sir?  Would that make me a better
soldier?"
598,THE CHIEF,598,"Any of you can stop this!  Just give
me the location of one more hide-
site, and it ends right here!"
599,SLUTNIK,599,Someone's trippin' out here...
600,THE CHIEF,600,"Three crews are still on this island
somewhere.  Who knows where?"
601,JORDAN,601,"Don't do it, don't do it..."
602,THE CHIEF,602,"Who's gonna tell me?  Who's gonna be
chivalrous and stop this abuse?
What, you want to see her get
mauled?  Is that it?"
603,JORDAN,603,Don't tell him shi --
604,THE CHIEF,604,She's fine!
605,THE CHIEF,605,"When I put you down, O'Neil, take
the hint and stay down."
606,THE CHIEF,606,"I am saving your life, O'Neil.  You
may not know it, but I do.  You're
an inferior soldier, a bad officer,
and I don't want you learning that
inconvenient truth when you're stuck
in a muddy bomb crater behind enemy
lines and don't know how the fuck to
get out.  You get out now, O'Neil.
Seek life elsewhere.  And if you
can't do it in front of me, do it
behind my back."
607,MCCOOL,607,Down... stay down...
608,JORDAN,608,"Fuck you and the boat you rode in
on.  Sir."
609,THE CHIEF,609,We're done here.
610,JORDAN,610,"Make you a deal, Flea.  Never tell
me how I look -- and I'll never tell
you."
611,THE CHIEF,611,"You don't think she'd be raped if
she were captured?  You don't think
the threat of rape would be used to
leverage the men?"
612,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,612,"You broke a dozen training rules
back there -- before I lost count."
613,THE CHIEF,613,"I've had it.  Just because they pay
me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean
I'm gonna be one."
614,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,614,"She's a trainee, just like the
others.  Why are you coming down so
hard?"
615,THE CHIEF,615,"She's an officer.  There's a higher
standard."
616,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,616,"She's a women, and that's why you're
ridin' her bareback."
617,THE CHIEF,617,"Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay
on her until everyone realizes this
is not some bullshit equal-rights
thing, that real lives are gonna be
lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours."
618,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,618,I oughtta report you.
619,THE CHIEF,619,"I think you probably would -- if you
didn't know I was right."
620,DEHAVEN,620,Yes?
621,DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.),621,Did you hear?
622,DEHAVEN,622,"She made it through S.E.R.E.
training.  Got a call this morning
from --"
623,DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.),623,"Not that.  The White House just
announced that it was sponsoring
legislation that would, in one
stroke, void all remaining elements
of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws."
624,DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.),624,You there?  Senator?
625,HAYES,625,"Without telling us they do this?
With absolutely no lead time?"
626,FLAG OFFICER #1,626,"Mr. Secretary, if this bill
passes..."
627,FLAG OFFICER #2,627,"Forget our three-year plan.  They're
rushing the cadence.  We'll be
forced to reorganize the Navy from
top to bottom -- overnight."
628,HAYES,628,"What the hell is the President
trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's
thunder?"
629,FLAG OFFICER #1,629,"I think it's more important, sir, to
decide what we're going to do --
since it's apparent this issue is
not going away quietly."
630,HAYES,630,"""G.I. Jane.""  And which one of you
told me she wouldn't last a week?
Huh?"
631,HAYES,631,"20 years in the Pentagon, I finally
rate an office with a window -- and
it looks out over the world's
largest graveyard.  Think it's a
sign?"
632,JORDAN,632,"Sorry, didn't mean to --"
633,WICKWIRE,633,"That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend.
And know I remember why."
634,JORDAN,634,"First big night of liberty and no
date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire."
635,WICKWIRE,635,"Maybe I'll just head over to McP's
with the others, have a drink or
four.  Don't wanna come, do you?"
636,JORDAN,636,I can't go out.  Not like this.
637,WICKWIRE,637,I think you look beautiful.
638,JORDAN,638,"Thanks for lying.  But you're the
class officer, Wick, and it'd just
be weird if we hook up.  Besides..."
639,BLONDELL,639,"Sorry.  Forgot I needed oregano
and..."
640,JORDAN,640,"Do you, uh, know..."
641,WICKWIRE,641,"Sure, sure."
642,JORDAN,642,"We're going over to her place to
make salad and pasta.  Just, you
know, nothing special."
643,WICKWIRE,643,Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
644,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,644,"... underwater detonation devices
employ mechanical timers, and as
such, they are subject to variances
due to water temperature.  That's
why when clearing mines, we always
use two timers.  The charts now
being passed out contain
calculations you must memorize
before..."
645,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,645,O'Neil?
646,JORDAN,646,Sir?
647,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,647,You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
648,YEOMAN,648,"This way, lieutenant.  They're
expecting you."
649,JORDAN,649,"See me, sir?"
650,C.O.,650,"I don't know of any delicate way to
say this, lieutenant, so I won't
try.  Claims have been made that you
have engaged in fraternization -- of
the same-sex variety.  Specifically,
that you were..."
651,C.O.,651,"""... seen leaving the apartment of
another female officer at such a
time and in such a manner as to
suggest conduct unbecoming."""
652,JORDAN,652,"Sir, if someone is suggesting that
I'm a lesbian, they're wrong."
653,JORDAN,653,"They're very wrong.  And I'd like to
know where you got this information."
654,WICKWIRE,654,"I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class
officer, it's my obligation to
report all violations."
655,JORDAN,655,"This is insane.  You've got no
proof."
656,X.O.,656,"You were seen leaving Ensign
Blondell's apartment at
approximately 0-200, whereupon
physical affections were exchanged
in public."
657,JORDAN,657,We hugged.
658,X.O.,658,"In addition, you have been seen
frequenting the base exchange, the
mess hall, the --"
659,JORDAN,659,"Because the men didn't want me
eating with them.  Jesus Christ,
let's get this right."
660,C.O.,660,That's enough.  Everybody.
661,C.O.,661,"Rejoin your class, lieutenant."
662,WICKWIRE,662,"I wish I didn't have to do this,
Jordan."
663,C.O.,663,"Dismissed, lieutenant."
664,JORDAN,664,"Sir, I just want you to know that
this is either a gross mistake --
or someone's vindictive bullshit.
In no way did anything happen
between Ensign Blondell and myself.
We're just friends."
665,X.O.,665,"So you're saying the charges have no
validity whatsoever?"
666,JORDAN,666,"I'm saying, we're just friends."
667,C.O.,667,"I find this as distasteful as you,
lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk,
it's on my shoulders.  There's going
to be an inquiry -- it will not be
quick and it will definitely not be
pretty.  You should prepare
yourself."
668,JORDAN,668,"Sir, please... if there's any way to
do this without dragging everyone
through the mud..."
669,C.O.,669,"I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed."
670,JORDAN,670,"Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under
your command... would the inquiry
still go forward?"
671,C.O.,671,I'm not sure what --
672,JORDAN,672,"Would you have the discretion to end
it right then and there?"
673,C.O.,673,I believe so.
674,MCCOOL,674,So what'd he want?  O'Neil?
675,FLEA,675,"Oh, no... no, no, no, no..."
676,THE CHIEF,676,Stand fast!
677,ROYCE,677,"I want to kill them... I want to
kill the guys who made you cry like
this..."
678,JORDAN,678,"All I wanted was an honest chance.
And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't
stay."
679,ROYCE,679,"And this class officer...
""Wickwire.""  You think he was just
trying to get even?  Striking back
for..."
680,JORDAN,680,"Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like
he was getting any satisfaction out
of it.  Almost like..."
681,JORDAN,681,Did I say he was class officer?
682,ROYCE,682,"Almost like someone put him up to
it.  Okay, who?"
683,JORDAN,683,No shortage of suspects.
684,ROYCE,684,"The Chief?  Or maybe even
Turrentine?  Your C.O.?"
685,JORDAN,685,"Royce.  Tell me you didn't keep a
file on me."
686,ROYCE,686,"Somebody was yankin' your stings,
Jordan -- maybe from 3,000 miles
away.  I wanted to know who.  I still
do."
687,ROYCE,687,"C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with
me."
688,JORDAN,688,"It's done with, Royce.  Let it go."
689,ROYCE,689,"Someone screwed you over like this,
left unanswered charges hanging over
your head, and you're not gonna
fight back?"
690,JORDAN,690,"I'm tired of fighting back.  I just
wanted to come home and be safe and
have you here and the river there
and just forget the rest of the
world, okay?"
691,ROYCE,691,"Well, before you crawl off to die,
Jordan, give me five minutes of good
headwork."
692,ROYCE,692,"""John James Urgayle.""  The Chief."
693,JORDAN,693,What about him.
694,JORDAN,694,"Instructors typically pull three
year assignments.  This guy's in and
out in one year -- your year.  That
sound right?"
695,JORDAN,695,Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
696,ROYCE,696,"Or like maybe he was baby sitting a
problem child for the Navy."
697,JORDAN,697,"I don't know, I don't care."
698,ROYCE,698,"Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who
else?  Who could've leveraged a
class officer like that?  C'mon,
Jordan, keep your head in the game."
699,DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.),699,"... just got word today.  The
Senator wants you to know that she's
disturbed by the matter, and she'll
be looking into it carefully to make
sure you were treated fairly.  If
you need to reach us, we're here in
Washington, 202-224-3121."
700,JORDAN,700,"""In Washington..."""
701,ROYCE,701,What?
702,JORDAN,702,"Wickwire said he was dry-docked in
Washington between stints at
Coronado..."
703,ROYCE,703,"""Wickwire, Thomas Dane""... Second
run at Coronado... and correct, they
had him stashed in the
""Appropriation Liaison Office,""
whatever that is."
704,JORDAN,704,"You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and
get another shot without
dispensation from someone up in flag
country."
705,JORDAN,705,He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
706,ROYCE,706,I'd sure like to know who.
707,JORDAN,707,Yeah.  Me too.
708,BLONDELL,708,"Administration, Ensign Blondell."
709,JORDAN (V.O.),709,Don't say my name.
710,BLONDELL,710,Who's...
711,BLONDELL,711,Lieuten --
712,JORDAN (V.O.),712,"Or rank.  But can you do me a favor
and pull a transfer order?"
713,BLONDELL,713,"Okay, but... You didn't have to do
what you did.  Not for me."
714,JORDAN (V.O.),714,"""Wickwire, Thomas Dane.""  See what
you can find."
715,BLONDELL,715,Got it.
716,JORDAN (V.O.),716,"Who signed as his ""sponsoring
officer""?"
717,BLONDELL,717,"Uh... don't see it.  There's no
signature.  But hang on -- there's a
note to ""See Addendum.""  Checking..."
718,BLONDELL,718,Wow...
719,JORDAN (V.O.),719,"What'd you find, Kathy?"
720,D.C. COP,720,"Don't even dream about leaving that
vehicle there."
721,ROYCE,721,"Government car -- tow it if you
want.  Just point us to DeHaven's
office first."
722,ROYCE,722,Capt'n.
723,NAVY CAPTAIN,723,Commander.
724,ROYCE,724,Get started here.  I'll catch up.
725,SECRETARY,725,Your name again?
726,JORDAN,726,Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil.
727,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,727,"Ms. O'Neil.  Yes, of course.  I'm
Douglas Champeau.  Unfortunately,
the Senator is in chamber right now.
How can I help you?"
728,JORDAN,728,What chamber?  Which way is that?
729,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,729,"I mean, she's on the floor of the
Senate."
730,JORDAN,730,"Okay, which way?"
731,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,731,"She really can't be disturbed.  But
if you care to wait, I'll find you
an office with a phone.  It might be
several hours, but --"
732,TOURIST,732,"'Scuse me, but I'm here to pick up
gallery tickets?  Are you..."
733,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,733,"See the secretary, please."
734,JORDAN (O.S.),734,Senator DeHaven...
735,JORDAN,735,DeHaven...
736,JORDAN,736,"We can talk here or we can talk
outside, Senator.  You tell me."
737,DEHAVEN,737,"Cloak room.  I'll meet her there.
Just her."
738,DEHAVEN,738,"Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get
together -- though just now I'm
gearing up for a child-care vote
that --"
739,JORDAN,739,Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
740,JORDAN,740,You know him.
741,DEHAVEN,741,Sounds familiar.
742,JORDAN,742,"It should.  You nominated him for
Spec-Recon just three days after you
nominated me."
743,DEHAVEN,743,"Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch
tomorrow?  I do very much want to
talk, but now is scarcely --"
744,JORDAN,744,"Did you set me up?  Did you set me
up just to see me fail?"
745,DEHAVEN,745,Absolutely not.
746,DEHAVEN,746,"Wickwire was there to help.  To be
my eyes on the inside, to make sure
you were getting a fair shot.  At
least that was the intent."
747,JORDAN,747,What changed?
748,DEHAVEN,748,Should probably ask him that.
749,JORDAN,749,"If I have to ask again, Senator,
I'll be asking in front of cameras."
750,DOORKEEPER,750,"Madam Senator?  Your esteemed
colleagues are requesting --"
751,DEHAVEN,751,"Two seconds, Walter."
752,DEHAVEN,752,"In 1981, the Supreme Court was
asked to rule on the issue of women
in combat positions.  The Court
cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws
as a legal foundation for keeping
women ineligible.  That decision
held for all these years -- until
the White House, 10 days ago, moved
to have the Exclusion Laws voided.
To demolish that legal foundation."
753,JORDAN,753,"So?  Isn't the President jumping on
your bandwagon?"
754,DEHAVEN,754,"What he did was light the bandwagon
on fire.  Because he knows what I
know -- that American families are
not prepared to put their daughters
in harm's way."
755,JORDAN,755,You don't know that.
756,DEHAVEN,756,"In face, I do:  Roper, Harris,
Gallop -- they all come back the
same."
757,JORDAN,757,"What are you saying?  That a women's
life is more valuable than a man's?
That a women's death hurts a family
more?"
758,DEHAVEN,758,"I'm saying it's not going to happen.
Not when the President is set to
turn this into a third-rail issue
should I choose to ever campaign
against him.  He will fry me six
ways to Sunday for sending daughters
and young mothers off to war -- and,
quite possibly, for bringing them
back in body bags."
759,JORDAN,759,"You were never going to let women
serve in combat.  You always had a
safety net.  Or thought you did."
760,DEHAVEN,760,"Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully
understand this -- but sometimes
there's more to be gained from the
fight than the victory."
761,JORDAN,761,"So the rhetoric gets you headlines.
But the reality gets you in trouble."
762,DEHAVEN,762,"The reality is this:  We send far
too many men off to war.  I don't
need to compound the problem with
women."
763,DEHAVEN,763,"Can you honestly tell me you wanted
that life?  Squat-pissing in some
third-world jungle with --"
764,JORDAN,764,"I wanted the choice.  The chance to
prove myself, my skills, my work,
me.  That's how it should've been."
765,DOORKEEPER,765,"Madam Senator, once again I must --"
766,DEHAVEN,766,"Just hold the goddamn clock, Walter."
767,DEHAVEN,767,"I once promised you a fast ticket,
Jordan, and I always meant to make
good on that.  Come work for me.  I
can always use a hard-charger on my
team."
768,JORDAN,768,"You promise Wickwire a fast ticket,
too?"
769,DEHAVEN,769,"I've had no direct communication
with him since this whole thing
began.  And that's quite verifiable."
770,JORDAN,770,I'm sure it is.
771,DEHAVEN,771,You'll think about my offer?
772,JORDAN,772,"You know, I wonder what the SecNav
would think about it.  If I spoke
with him."
773,DEHAVEN,773,"Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this
morning myself -- and told him the
deal was off.  No more test cases.
He was only too happy to oblige."
774,DEHAVEN,774,"Don't play politics with me, little
darlin'.  You'd be up way past your
bedtime."
775,DOORKEEPER,775,"Madam Senator, please..."
776,DEHAVEN,776,I'll call you in a few days.
777,JORDAN,777,"So I wonder what the President would
think."
778,C.O.,778,"Yes sir.  No, I'm not saying it
would be impossible, sir, just...
Yes sir.  No sir.  Yes sir.  I can
appreciate that, sir.  Good night,
sir."
779,C.O.,779,"Well, if you had to go over my
head, lieutenant, that's the way to
do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200
call from the Commander and Chief to
get the bowels movin'."
780,JORDAN,780,Sir?  What did he say?
781,C.O.,781,"Basically -- he asked me if I could
unring a bell."
782,C.O.,782,"One of you here understands better
than anyone what this is all about.
Someone who has engaged in conduct
unbecoming.  Someone who knows, I
would hope, what he must now do."
783,C.O.,783,"And unless that someone takes the
honorable way out in the next 10
seconds -- I will make certain he
faces action under the Uniform Code
of Military Justice."
784,JORDAN,784,Just walk away and never stop.
785,C.O.,785,"It seems we have an opening for
class officer.  Any nominations?"
786,C.O.,786,All those in favor?
787,C.O.,787,"Chief Urgayle, turning it back over
to you."
788,THE CHIEF,788,"Well, I'm trying to figure out if
you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous
-- or some new alloy of all three."
789,JORDAN,789,"Good to see you again, too, sir."
790,THE CHIEF,790,"Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed
all the others.  Now try me."
791,THE CHIEF,791,Four... three... two... one... hack!
792,THE CHIEF,792,"Final assignment!  Each crew will be
dropped 12 miles out!  Between you
and the shore is a network of mines
and underwater obstacles!  You will
clear the obstacles, you will tag
the mines with your crew number!
You have until 18-hundred to make
landfall!"
793,THE CHIEF,793,"Remember!  The one thing you can
count on in any mission is that
anything mechanical will fail!  If
you get stuck out here, do not call
me, for you will no longer be in my
class!  Try the Coast Guard!"
794,JORDAN,794,One-second intervals!  Go!
795,FLEA,795,"C'mon, c'mon..."
796,CORTEZ,796,"This tank's not gonna cut it, el-
tee.  Handle's stripped."
797,SLUTNIK,797,I just wonder how that happened.
798,JORDAN,798,"Cortez, see if you can dig out the
tools without losing the rest of out
gear.  Try a wrench on that thing."
799,THE CHIEF,799,What happening?!
800,PILOT,800,Fucking pelicans!  Hang on!
801,PILOT,801,Holy... LET'S GYRATE!
802,MCCOOL,802,What the shit is...
803,SLUTNIK,803,"You don't suppose this is just part
of..."
804,JORDAN,804,"FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT!
Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the
hell you waiting for?"
805,JORDAN,805,"Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  We
have a downed helo 12 miles west-
south west of base with three
aboard.  Repeat, we have a downed
helo with three aboard..."
806,FLEA,806,CUT IT!  CUT IT HERE!
807,FLEA,807,"Close as I can get, el-tee!"
808,JORDAN,808,"Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take
your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!"
809,JORDAN,809,"Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  What
is your E.T.A. on that rescue helo?
Over."
810,BASE (V.O.),810,"Crew Leader, we have a Medevac
rerouting from Long Beach, but no
other helos prepped at this time.
Seafox One and Two are launching
now.  Over."
811,JORDAN,811,"Base, don't think you copied me.  We
are 12 miles out.  Seafox tops out
at 30 knots, which makes it a no-
show for 18 minutes.  Over."
812,BASE (V.O.),812,"You copied right, Crew Leader.
We're looking for options ourselves."
813,SLUTNIK,813,"Maybe we should call the Coast
Guard."
814,JORDAN,814,"Shut your hole, Slutnik."
815,MCCOOL,815,"Visibility drops dead at 40 feet.
If they're deeper than that..."
816,CORTEZ,816,"Nobody's comin' outta that crash,
el-tee.  Nobody."
817,THE CHIEF (V.O.),817,"Base, this is Basher One.  I've got
a small problem here.  Do you copy?"
818,JORDAN,818,"Basher One, this is O'Neil.  We are
barely reading you.  What is your
situation?"
819,THE CHIEF,819,"Got one other heartbeat here, looks
touch and go.  I've got a
questionable leg."
820,THE CHIEF (V.O.),820,"Managed to activate the ELB.  If you
just radio base and let them know,
they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make
sure they send a helo with a winch
-- door's blocked by a reef.  Over."
821,JORDAN,821,"Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be
here for 15 minutes.  What's your
air situation?  Over."
822,THE CHIEF (V.O.),822,Say again?  How many micks?
823,JORDAN,823,"15, sir."
824,THE CHIEF,824,That... may not be adequate.
825,FLEA,825,If we could just fix on him...
826,MCCOOL,826,Beacon's a no-go for us.
827,JORDAN,827,"Chief -- did I see a flare box
aboard?  And can you get at it?
Over."
828,THE CHIEF (V.O.),828,Got it.
829,JORDAN,829,"Show us where you are, Chief."
830,FLEA,830,"Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!"
831,JORDAN,831,"Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to
slip you some air, so we're coming
down with a tank -- just something
until the A-team shows.  Over."
832,JORDAN,832,Chief?
833,CHIEF (V.O.),833,"O'Neil... there's no air in your
main tanks."
834,MCCOOL,834,What?
835,THE CHIEF,835,"This mission wasn't about tagging
mines.  It was to see how you coped
with mechanical failures.  Pretty
fuckin' ironic, huh?"
836,SLUTNIK,836,"He's circlin' the drain, el-tee."
837,JORDAN,837,"So we got two full mini-tanks, three
minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air
in yours?"
838,MCCOOL,838,Maybe half.  Not even.
839,JORDAN,839,"Grab an oar, find a way to weight it
down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez,
help him.  Flea?  You take one of the
two full minis -- and just follow my
lead."
840,CORTEZ,840,"What, we're gonna pry 'em out with
paddles?"
841,MCCOOL,841,"O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as
soon as we get down there.  You know
that, don't you?"
842,JORDAN,842,So I guess we get one shot at it.
843,THE CHIEF,843,Why'd it have to be her...
844,JORDAN,844,"Chief, sir... still with me?"
845,CHIEF,845,"Take him first.  Once he's clear,
come back with --"
846,JORDAN,846,"Sir, let me suggest you stop giving
orders and start doing exactly what
I say, because that's the only way
we're all getting out of here.  Now
how's your vest check out?  Still
good?"
847,JORDAN,847,"Flea, take the pilot up slow, feed
him air.  Chief, sir, you and I are
gonna take the express elevator
outta here.  Remember to let your
air out.  Ready?"
848,THE CHIEF,848,O'Neil...
849,JORDAN,849,"Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating."
850,MCCOOL,850,Hoooooo-yah!
851,NEWBERRY,851,"Go, go, go, go!"
852,SLUTNIK,852,"Uh-huh!  That's right!  Just like we
always practice it!"
853,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,853,"Senator DeHaven is here for the
graduation ceremonies."
854,BASE GUARD,854,What are all these other vehicles?
855,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,855,Just a small press corps.  Routine.
856,BASE GUARD,856,And that pickup truck at the end?
857,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,857,"That?  That would be the all-woman
America's Cup team."
858,C.O.,858,"Special Reconnaissance Class 118,
you may now stand down."
859,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,859,"Lieutenant?  I was asked to give you
this."
860,JORDAN,860,The Navy Cross...
861,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,861,"I believe he earned it for saving a
man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He
wanted you to have it.  He was very
clear on that point."
862,JORDAN,862,"I was looking for him earlier,
but..."
863,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,863,"The Chief was granted early
retirement as of 17-hundred
yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was
gone.  Out of the Navy."
864,JORDAN,864,Just a coincidence?
865,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,865,"Maybe it's not my place to speculate
on his private thoughts.  But I
think the Chief knew that his way --
his world -- had come and gone."
866,DEHAVEN,866,"... of course, we always prefer
peace to war.  But if we're going to
war, give women a piece.  Give them
the choice to defend their country.
And if the President doesn't like
that idea -- if he wants to continue
to deny women their equal rights --
then I'll be happy to step out back
with him any time, anywhere..."
867,DEHAVEN,867,"Jordan?  Jordan, dear..."
868,C.O.,868,"Senator, perhaps this would be a
good time for that lunch.  Will the
America's Cup team be joining us?"
869,JORDAN,869,"So here we are again.  Staring three
years of operational duty in the
face."
870,ROYCE,870,"Look.  It's not like you'd be
completely out of reach.  And maybe
we could call in a few favors, get
you stationed at Norfolk instead of
Coronado.  There are ways of dealing
with these things -- I mean, if
people are so inclined."
871,JORDAN,871,Which is guy-speak for...
872,ROYCE,872,"""Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no
matter how long."""
