12,RALPH,12,"Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!"
13,BRAD,13,"Well I don't think there was any doubt
about that - You and Betty have been
almost inseparable ever since you sat
in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures."
14,RALPH,14,"Tell you the truth Brad, she was the
only reason I came in the first place.
Science was never one of my favourite
subjects but I sure with Dr Scott
could have made it today."
15,BRAD,15,"Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him.
We drove over to see him last vacation.
It's a shame his new job took him away
from Denton."
16,RALPH,16,"Hey fella.  It looks like it could be
your turn next."
17,BRAD,17,Who knows...ha ha.
18,JANET (who is holding the bouquet),18,"Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't
Betty look radiantly beautiful.
Just an hour ago she was plain old
Betty Monroe.  Now she's Mrs.
Ralph Hapschatt."
19,BRAD (Still looking after the car),19,"Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a
lucky guy.  (They start to move d.s.)"
20,JANET,20,Yes.
21,BRAD,21,"Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful
little cook."
22,JANET,22,Yes.
23,BRAD,23,"And Ralph himself will be in line for
promotion in a year or so."
24,JANET,24,Yes.
25,BRAD (spoken),25,Hey Janet.
26,JANET,26,Yes Brad.
27,BRAD,27,I've got something to say.
28,JANET,28,Uh huh.
29,BRAD,29,"I really loved the skilful way
You beat the other girls
To the bride's bouquet."
30,JANET,30,Oh Brad.
31,BRAD,31,The river was deep but I swam it.
32,FAMILY (Riff & Magenta),32,Janet.
33,BRAD,33,The future is ours so let's plan it.
34,FAMILY (R & M),34,Janet.
35,BRAD,35,So please don't tell me to can it.
36,FAMILY (R & M),36,Janet.
37,BRAD,37,"I've one thing to say and that's
Dammit, Janet.
I love you.
The road was long but I ran it.

And you fan it.  (Jumps off)"

43,BRAD (Getting chalk from pocket),43,"I've one thing to say and that's,
Dammit, Janet."
44,BRAD,44,I love you.
45,BRAD,45,"Here's a ring to prove that
I'm not joker."
46,BRAD,46,"There's three ways that love can grow.
That's good bad or mediocre."
47,BRAD,47,"Oh - J - A - N - E - T
I love you so."
48,JANET,48,"Oh!......It's nicer than
Betty Munroe had"
49,MAGENTA (Peering up from behind pew),49,Oh Brad.
50,JANET,50,Now we're engaged and I'm so glad.
51,MAGENTA & COLUMBIA,51,Oh Brad.  (Both peer up and disappear)
52,JANET,52,"That you met Mom
And you know Dad."
53,WHOLE FAMILY,53,Oh Brad.  (peering up together)
54,JANET (Taking his arm),54,"I've one thing to say
And that's, Brad
I'm mad,
For you too."
55,JANET (Laying head on Brad's sh.),55,"Oh, Brad."
56,BRAD,56,Oh Dammit.
57,JANET (Caresses his cheek),57,I'm mad.....
58,BRAD,58,Oh Janet

Who began it"
63,FAMILY (Carrying coffin),63,Janet.
64,BRAD,64,"When we met in his science exam
It -"
65,FAMILY,65,Janet.

And then panic,"
67,FAMILY,67,Janet
68,BRAD,68,"I've got one thing to say, and that's
Dammit,
Janet.
I love you."
69,BRAD (Circling Janet),69,"Dammit, Janet."
70,JANET,70,"Oh Brad,
I'm mad."
71,BRAD,71,"Dammit, Janet."
72,"BRAD, JANET, FAMILY.",72,I love you.
73,NARRATOR,73,"I would like if I may to take you on a
strange journey."
74,NARRATOR,74,"It seemed a fairly ordinary night when
Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss
(two young ordinary healthy kids) left
Denton that late November evening to
visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and
now friend of both of them.  It's true
there were dark storm clouds, heavy,
black and pendulous, toward which they
were driving.  It's true also that the
spare tyre they were carrying was badly
in need of some air.  But they being
normal kids and on a night out, well
they were not going to let a storm
spoil the events of their evening.
On a night out."
75,NARRATOR,75,"It was a night out they were going to
remember for a very long time."
76,JANET,76,"Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist
that's passed us.  They certainly take
their lives in their hands.  What with
the weather and all."
77,BRAD,77,"Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to
that type."
78,JANET,78,"What's the matter Brad, darling?"
79,BRAD,79,"I think we took the wrong fork a few
miles back."
80,JANET,80,"Oh dear!  But then where did the
motorcyclists come from?"
81,BRAD,81,"Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have
to turn back."
82,JANET,82,What was that bang?
83,BRAD,83,We must have a blow-out.
84,JANET,84,Oh...
85,BRAD,85,"You'd better sit here and keep warm
while I go for help."
86,JANET,86,"But where will you go?  We're in the
middle of nowhere."
87,BRAD,87,"Didn't we pass a castle back down the
road a few miles?  Maybe they have
a telephone I might use."
88,JANET,88,I'm coming with you.
89,BRAD,89,There's no point both of us getting wet.
90,JANET,90,I'm coming with you.
91,JANET,91,"Besides, darling, the owner of the phone
might be a beautiful woman and you may
never come back."
92,JANET,92,"In the velvet darkness
Of the blackest night
Burning bright."
93,JANET,93,"There's a guiding star
No matter what or who you are."
94,BRAD & JANET,94,There's a light
95,PHANTOM VOICES,95,Over at the Frankenstein place.
96,BRAD,96,There's a light.
97,PHANTOM VOICES,97,Burning in the fireplace.
98,JANET,98,"There's a light, a light
In the darkness of everybody's life"
99,BRAD,99,"I can see the flag fly
I can see the rain
Just the same
There has got to be
Something better here
For you and me."
100,BRAD & JANET,100,There's a light.
101,PHANTOM VOICES,101,Burning in the fireplace.
102,BRAD,102,There's a light.
103,BRAD,103,"A light
In the darkness of everybody's life."
104,RIFF RAFF,104,"The darkness must go
Down the river of nights dreaming
Flow morphia slow
Let the sun and light come streaming
Into my life."
105,RIFF RAFF,105,Into my life.
106,BRAD & JANET,106,There's a light.
107,PHANTOM VOICES,107,Over at the Frankenstein place.
108,BRAD & JANET,108,There's a light.
109,PHANTOM VOICES,109,Burning in the fireplace.
110,PHANTOM VOICES,110,"There's a light, a light."
111,BRAD & JANET,111,In the darkness of everybody's life.
112,NARRATOR,112,"And so it seemed that fortune had smiled
on Brad and Janet and that they had found
the assistance that their plight required -
or had they?"
113,JANET,113,"Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold
and I'm frightened."
114,BRAD,114,"Just a moment, Janet.  They may have
a telephone."
115,RIFF RAFF,115,Hello.
116,BRAD,116,"Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors.
And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I -
ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our
car has broken down about two miles up the
road.  Do you have a phone we might use?"
117,RIFF RAFF,117,You're wet.
118,JANET,118,"Yes, the rain has been very heavy."
119,BRAD,119,Yes.
120,RIFF RAFF,120,Yes.
121,RIFF RAFF,121,I think you had better both come inside.
122,JANET,122,You're too kind.
123,JANET,123,"Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind
of place is this?"
124,BRAD,124,"Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting
lodge for rich weirdos."
125,RIFF RAFF,125,This way.
126,JANET,126,Are you - giving a party?
127,RIFF RAFF,127,"No.  You've arrived on a rather special
night.  It's one of the master's affairs."
128,JANET,128,"Oh, lucky him."
129,MAGENTA,129,He's lucky.
130,MAGENTA,130,"You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all
lucky."
131,RIFF RAFF,131,"It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness takes its toll
But listen closely
Not for very much longer
I've got to keep control."
132,RIFF RAFF,132,I remember doing the Time Warp.
133,RIFF RAFF,133,"Drinking those moments when
The blackness would hit me."
134,RIFF RAFF,134,And the void would be calling.
135,GUESTS,135,Let's do the Time Warp again.
136,GUESTS,136,Let's do the Time Warp again.
137,NARRATOR,137,It's just a jump to the left.
138,GUESTS,138,"And a step to the right - right -
right - right - right."
139,NARRATOR,139,With your hands on your hips.
140,GUESTS,140,"You bring your knees in tight.
But it's the pelvic thrust."
141,GUESTS (Cont),141,They really drive you insane.
142,GUESTS (Cont),142,Let's do the Time Warp again.
143,GUESTS,143,Let's do the Time Warp again.
144,MAGENTA,144,"It's so dreamy
Oh, fantasy free me
So you can't see me
No not at all."
145,MAGENTA,145,In another dimension.
146,MAGENTA,146,With voyeuristic intention.
147,MAGENTA,147,"Well secluded I see all
With a bit of a mind flip
You're into the time slip
Nothing will ever seem the same."
148,MAGENTA,148,You're spaced out on sensation.
149,MAGENTA,149,Like you're under sedation.
150,GUESTS,150,Let's do the Time Warp again.
151,GUESTS,151,Let's do the Time Warp again.
152,COLUMBIA,152,"Well I was walking down the street
Just having a think
When a snake of a guy
Gave me an evil wink.
Well it shook me up
It took me by surprise
He had a pick-up truck
And the devil's eyes
He stared at me
And I felt a change
Time meant nothing
Never would again."
153,GUESTS,153,Let's do the Time Warp again.
154,GUESTS,154,Let's do the Time Warp again.
155,NARRATOR,155,It's just a jump to the left.
156,GUESTS,156,And then a step to the right.
157,NARRATOR,157,With your hands on your hips.
158,GUESTS,158,You bring your knees in tight.
159,GUESTS,159,But it's the pelvic thrust.
160,GUESTS,160,"That really drives you insane.
Let's do the Time Warp again."
161,GUESTS,161,Let's do the Time Warp again.
162,JANET,162,Oh....Say something.
163,BRAD,163,Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
164,JANET,164,"Brad, please lets get out of here."
165,BRAD,165,For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
166,JANET,166,But it seems so unhealthy here.
167,BRAD,167,It's just a..a party Janet.
168,JANET,168,Well I want to leave.
169,BRAD,169,We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
170,JANET,170,Then ask the butler - or someone.
171,BRAD,171,"Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want
to interfere with their celebrations."
172,JANET,172,"This isn't the Junior Chamber of
Commerce Brad."
173,BRAD,173,"They're probably foreigners with ways
different from our own.  -  They may
do some more folk dancing."
174,JANET,174,"Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared."
175,BRAD,175,"I'm here, there's nothing to worry about."
176,FRANK,176,"How do you do.
I see you've met my faithful handyman.
He's a little brought down -
Because when you knocked
He thought you were the candyman."
177,FRANK,177,"Don't get strung out by the way
that I look."
178,FRANK,178,"Don't judge a book by its cover
I'm not much of a man
By the light of day
But by night I'm one hell of a lover."
179,FRANK,179,"I'm just a sweet Transvestite
From Transexual Transylvania."
180,FRANK,180,"Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound
You look like you're both pretty groovie."
181,FRANK,181,"Or if you want something visual
not too abysmal
We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie."
182,BRAD,182,"I'm glad we caught you at home
Ah - could we use your phone
We're both in a bit of a hurry."
183,JANET,183,Right!
184,BRAD,184,"We'll just say where we are
Then go back to the car
We don't want to be any worry."
185,FRANK,185,"You got caught with a flat
Well how about that
Well babies don't you panic
By the light of the night
It'll seem alright
I'll get you a satanic mechanic."
186,FRANK,186,"I'm just a sweet transvestite
From Transexual Transylvania."
187,FRANK,187,Why dont'cha stay for the night
188,RIFF & MAGENTA,188,"""night""
Or maybe a bite"
189,RIFF & MAGENTA,189,"""bite""
I could show you my favourite obsession
I've been making a man
With blonde hair and a tan
And he's good for relieving my tension."
190,FRANK,190,"I'm just a sweet transvestite
From Transexual Transylvania."
191,FRANK,191,I'm just a sweet transvestite.
192,GUESTS,192,"""Sweet Transvestite"""
193,FRANK,193,From Transexual Transylvania.
194,GUESTS,194,"""Transylvania"""
195,FRANK,195,So come up to the Lab.
196,FRANK (Cont),196,And see what's on the slab.
197,FRANK (Cont),197,I see you shiver with anticipation
198,FRANK (Cont),198,But maybe the rain
199,FRANK (Cont),199,Is really to blame
200,FRANK (Cont),200,"So I'll remove the cause
But not the symptom"
201,COLUMBIA,201,"Slowly, slowly.  It's too nice a job
to rush."
202,JANET,202,Oh Brad.
203,BRAD,203,"It's alright Janet, we'll play along
for now and pull out the aces when the
time is right."
204,BRAD,204,"Ah, hi.  My name is Brad Majors and
this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  You
are ..."
205,COLUMBIA,205,"You are very lucky to be invited up
to Frank's laboratory.  Some people
would give their right arm for the
privilege."
206,BRAD,206,People like you maybe
207,COLUMBIA,207,I've seen it.
208,JANET,208,It he - Frank - is he your husband?
209,RIFF RAFF,209,"The Master is not yet married.  Nor
do I think he ever will be.  We are
simply his servants."
210,JANET,210,Oh.
211,FRANK,211,"Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff."
212,FRANK,212,I will entertain...ah...
213,BRAD,213,"I'm Brad Majors and this
is my fiancee, Janet Vice."
214,JANET,214,Weiss.
215,BRAD,215,Weiss.
216,FRANK (Taking Janet's hand to kiss),216,"Encante....How nice.  (he circles them)
And what charming underclothes you both have.
(He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff
and hands them to Brad).
But here, put these on.  They'll
make you feel less vulnerable."
217,FRANK (continues),217,"It's not often we receive visitors here.
Let alone offer them hospitality."
218,BRAD (Moving towards Frank),218,"Hospitality!  All we wanted to do was
use your telephone.  A reasonable request
which you have chosen to ignore."
219,JANET (Hurring after Brad),219,Don't be ungrateful Brad.
220,BRAD (Stepping closer to Frank),220,Ungrateful!
221,FRANK,221,"How forceful you are Brad.  Such a
perfect specimen of manhood.  So dominant."
222,FRANK,222,You must be awfully proud of him Janet.
223,JANET,223,"Well, yes I am."
224,FRANK,224,Do you have any tattoos Brad.
225,BRAD,225,Certainly not!
226,FRANK,226,Oh well.  How about you.  (He laughs)
227,RIFF RAFF,227,"Everything is in readiness, Master.
We merely await your word."
228,FRANK,228,"Tonight...One, one, one.  Can you hear
me at the back?
Tonight, my unconventional conventionists."
229,FRANK,229,"Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough
in biochemical research."
230,FRANK,230,And paradise is to be mine.
231,FRANK,231,"It was strange the way it happened.
One of those quirks of fate really.
One of those moments when you seem
irredeemably lost:  you panic; you're
trapped; your back's against the wall.
There's no way out, and then suddenly,
you get a break.  (He cracks the bones
in his hand)  All the pieces seem to
fit into place.  What a sucker you'r
been. What a fool.  The answer was there
all the time.  It took a small accident
to make it happen.  An accident!"
232,MAGENTA & COLUMBIA (softly),232,An accident.
233,FRANK,233,"That's how I discovered the secret.
That elusive ingredient, that spark
that is the breath of life."
234,FRANK (Moving to tank),234,"You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate.
For tonight is the night that my beautiful
creature is destined to be born."
235,FRANK,235,"Throw open the switches on the sonic
oscillator."
236,FRANK,236,"And step up the reactor power input
three more points."
237,JANET,237,Brad...
238,BRAD,238,It's alright Janet.
239,ROCKY,239,"The Sword of Damocles is
Hanging over my head."
240,ROCKY,240,"And I've got the feeling
Someone's going to be
Cutting the thread.
Oh, woe is me.
My life is a misery.
Oh, can't you see
That I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer...."
241,ROCKY,241,"I woke up this morning
With a start
When I fell out of bed."
242,"GUESTS (inc. Riff, Magenta & Columbia)",242,That ain't no crime.
243,ROCKY,243,"And left from my dreaming
Was a feeling
Of un-nameable dread."
244,GUESTS,244,That ain't no crime
245,ROCKY,245,"My high is low.
I'm dressed up
With no place to go.
And all I know
Is I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer."
246,"GUESTS (inc. RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA)",246,"Sha la la la
That ain't no crime."
247,ROCKY,247,"Oh, no no, no no."

That ain't no crime -
That ain't no crime."
251,NARRATOR,251,"Rocky needed peace of mind.
He didn't know
He was doing just fine.
He was the product
Of another time.
And as for feeling down -
Well that's not a crime."
252,"GUESTS (Riff, Magenta & Columbia)",252,That ain't no crime.
253,ROCKY (To first group of guests),253,"The sword of Damocles is
Hanging over my head."
254,GUESTS,254,That ain't no crime.
255,ROCKY (To second group),255,"And I've got the feeling

256,GUESTS,256,That ain't no crime.
257,ROCKY (To third group),257,"Oh, woe is me -
My life is a mystery.
(To fourth group)
Oh can't you see
That I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer."

268,FRANK,268,"Well.  That's no way to
behave on your first day out."
269,FRANK,269,"But as you're such an
exceptional beauty I'm
prepared to forgive."
270,FRANK,270,I just love success.
271,RIFF RAFF (edging up to Frank),271,"He is a credit to your
genius, Master."
272,FRANK,272,Yes.
273,MAGENTA (Moving to tank from controls),273,A triumph of your vill.
274,FRANK,274,Yes.

276,FRANK,276,"O.K?  (Moving out behind tank towards
Janet and Brad)  I think we can do a
little better than that.
You.  (To Janet)  What do you think?"
277,JANET,277,"Well.  (She looks at Brad)  I don't
like men with...er, with too many, muscles."
278,FRANK,278,I didn't make him for you
279,FRANK,279,"He carries the Charles Atlas seal of
approval....And he didn't even take
the lessons."
280,FRANK,280,"A weakling weighing
Ninety eight pounds
Will get sand in his face
When kicked to the ground.
And soon in the gym (ROCKY sits on horse)
With a determined chin
The sweat from his pores
As he works for his ca-ha-hause"
281,FRANK,281,"Will make him glisten - thank you -
And gleam.
And with massage
And just a little bit of
Ste-he-he-he-hem...(laughs)
He'll be pink.
And quite clean."
282,FRANK,282,"He'll be a strong man -
Oh honey -"
283,"GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK.",283,But the wrong man.
284,FRANK,284,"He'll eat nutritious high protein
And swallow raw eggs.
Try to build up his shoulders,
His chest, arms and legs.
Such an effort -
If he only knew of my plan.
In just seven days,"
285,"GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK",285,I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an
286,FRANK,286,"He'll do press-ups and chin-ups,
Do the snatch, clean and jerk."
287,FRANK,287,"He thinks dynamic tension
Must be hard work.
Such strenuous living
I just don't understand."
288,FRANK,288,"When, in just seven days -
Oh baby...(ROCKY jumps up.)
I can make you
A ma-a-a-a-an...(laugh)."
289,COLUMBIA,289,Eddie!
290,EDDIE,290,Stay cool baby.
291,JANET,291,Who's Eddie?
292,RIFF RAFF,292,The delivery boy.
293,MAGENTA,293,His delivery wasn't good enough though.
294,EDDIE,294,"Whatever happened to Saturday night
When you dressed up sharp
And you felt alright
It don't seem the same since cosmic light
Came into my life and I thought I was divine."
295,EDDIE,295,"I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio."
296,EDDIE,296,"A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show
And we climbed in the back
And we really had a good time"
297,ALL,297,"Hot patootie
Bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
(four times)"
298,EDDIE,298,"My head used to swim
From the perfume I smelled.
My hands kind of fumbled
With her white plastic belt.
I'd taster her baby pink lipstick,
And that's when I'd melt.
And she'd whisper in my ear,
Tonight she really was mine.
Get back in front and put
Some hair oil on.
Buddy Holly was singing
His very last song.
With your arms around your girl
You tried to - ah - sing along
It felt pretty good, whoo.
Really had a good ti-i-ime."
299,ALL,299,"Hot patootie
Bless my soul.
I really love that rock and roll.
Hot patootie
Bless my soul.
I really love that rock and roll.

301,FRANK,301,One from the vaults.
302,FRANK,302,And so perish all those who reject my love!
303,FRANK,303,"Oh no, my little Adonis -
You're much too beautiful to be destroyed.
He had a certain naive charm - but no muscle."
304,FRANK,304,"But a deltoid
And a bicep,
A hot groin
And a tricep
Makes me - ooh -
Shake.
Makes me want
To take
Charles Atlas
By the ha-and.
In just seven days -
Oh baby -"
305,"GUESTS, RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK",305,"I can make you a
Ma-ha-ha-ha-haan.
I don't want no dissension
Just dynamic tension.
In just seven days
I can make you
A ma-ha-ha-ha-haan.
In just seven days
I can make you
A ma-ha-ha-ha-haaan."
306,NARRATOR,306,"There are some people who say that life
is an illusion, and that reality is simply
a figment of our imaginations!  If this
is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe.
However, the sudden departure of their
host and his creation (into the seclusion
of his sombre bridal suite) had left them
feeling both apprehensive and uneasy.
A feeling which grew as the other guests
'departed' and 'they' were shown to their
separate rooms."
307,JANET,307,Who is it?  Who's there?
308,BRAD'S VOICE,308,"It's only me, Janet."
309,JANET,309,"Oh, Brad, come in, darling."
310,JANET,310,"Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling -
what if..."
311,BRAD,311,"It's alright Janet.  Everything's going
to be alright."
312,JANET,312,"Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me
switch on the light."
313,BRAD,313,"No, don't do that."
314,JANET,314,Oh don't be so shy.
315,JANET,315,YOU!
316,FRANK,316,"I'm afraid so, Janet.  But isn't it nice?"
317,JANET,317,"You beast, you monster, what have you
done with Brad?"
318,FRANK,318,"Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?"
319,JANET,319,"You tricked me - I wouldn't have -
I've never - never"
320,FRANK,320,"I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it?
In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable.
Mmmmm so soft, so sensual."
321,JANET,321,"Oh - Oh - no - stop - I mean help.
I - Brad - Oh."
322,JANET,322,Brad.
323,FRANK,323,"Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now.
Do you want him to see you like this?"
324,JANET,324,"Like this - like how?  It's your fault.
You're to blame."
325,JANET,325,I was saving myself.
326,FRANK,326,"Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet."
327,JANET,327,Promise you won't tell Brad.
328,FRANK,328,Cross my heart and hope to die.
329,JANET'S VOICE,329,"Oh Brad, it's no good here.  It will
destroy us."
330,BRAD,330,"Don't worry Janet, we'll be away
from here in the morning.  Hmmmm,
you smell so good."
331,JANET,331,"Oh Brad.  Oh no.  Not till after
the wedding, Darling."
332,BRAD,332,"Alright, Janet.  I understand."
333,JANET,333,Maybe we could try it this way.
334,BRAD,334,"Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet.
Everything's going to be alright."
335,JANET,335,I hope so my darling.
336,JANET,336,"No, don't put on the l..."
337,BRAD,337,You!
338,FRANK,338,"I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?"
339,BRAD,339,Why you - what have you done with Janet?
340,FRANK,340,Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
341,BRAD,341,"You tricked me.  I wouldn't have -
I've never - never."
342,FRANK,342,"I know, but it wasn't all bad was it?
I think you found it quite pleasurable."
343,FRANK,343,Oh so soft.  So sensual.
344,BRAD,344,Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.
345,BRAD,345,Janet.
346,FRANK,346,"Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now.
Do you want her to see you like this?"
347,BRAD,347,Like this.
348,BRAD,348,"Like how?  It's your fault - you're to
blame.  I thought it was the real thing."
349,FRANK,349,"Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was
enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime
in giving yourself over to pleasure."
350,FRANK (Switches off light),350,"Oh Brad, you have wasted so much time
already.  Janet needn't know, I won't tell her."
351,BRAD,351,You promise you won't tell?
352,FRANK,352,On my mother's grave.
353,RIFF RAFF,353,"Master, Rocky has broken his chains
and vanished.  The new playmate is loose
and in the castle ground.  Magenta has
just released the dogs."
354,FRANK,354,I'm coming.
355,JANET,355,"What's happening here?  Where's Brad?
Where's anybody?"
356,BRAD,356,"Once in a while she don't want to call you
Speaking on the telephone
Once in your life she won't want to know you
You look around
The one you've found
She is gone."
357,JANET,357,"I'm engaged to Brad just the same as
Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt.
But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with
an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before.
Hot, burning kisses."
358,BRAD,358,"And that's all the time that it takes
For a heart to turn to stone
The sweeter the wine
The harder to make the break
You hear something about someone
You'd thought you'd known."
359,JANET,359,"I could see Brad's face before me and my
mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry -
too hungry."
360,BRAD,360,"So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow
After the night there's a brand new day.
And there'll be no pain
And no more sorrow.
So wash your face
And phone my place
It'll be O.K."
361,JANET,361,"I wanted to be loved completely.
My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad,
Brad my darling, how could I have
done this to you?"
362,BRAD,362,"And that's all the time that it takes
For a heart to beat again.
So give me a sign
That a lover makes
You look around
The one you've found
Is back again."
363,JANET,363,"If only we hadn't made this journey.
If only the car hadn't broken down.
If only we were amongst friends or sane persons."
364,NARRATOR,364,"""If"" and ""Only"", two small words.  Words
which kept repeating themselves again and
again in Janet's thoughts.  But it was too
late to go back now.  It was as if she were
riding a giant tidal wave.  It would be folly
to fight against it.  Her only chance would
be to ride it out - adapt - and perhaps also
to survive."
365,JANET,365,"Yes.  There you see it's instinctive.
This room is your womb.  You returned
here for one thing - security."
366,JANET,366,Oh Brad!  What have they done with him?
367,JANET,367,Ahhh!
368,JANET,368,Oh Brad.  How could you?
369,JANET,369,"Oh, but you're hurt.  Did they do this
to you?"
370,JANET,370,"Here, lie down.  I'll dress your wounds."
371,NARRATOR,371,"""Emotion"".  Mental agitation - an excited
state of."
372,NARRATOR,372,"It is also an irrational and powerful master
and from what Janet had witnessed on the
monitor, there seemed to be little doubt that
she was indeed its slave."
373,COLUMBIA & MAGENTA,373,"Tell us about it, Janet."
374,JANET,374,"I was feeling done in
Couldn't win
I'd only ever kissed before"
375,COLUMBIA,375,You mean she only ever kissed?
376,JANET,376,"I thought there's no use getting
Into heavy petting."
377,JANET,377,"It only leads to trouble
And seat wetting."
378,JANET,378,"Now all I want to know
Is how to go
I've tasted blood
And I want more
I'll put up no resistance
I want to stay the distance
I've got an itch to scratch
And I need assistance."
379,JANET,379,"Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me.
I wanna be dirty.
Thrill me, chill me, fulfil me.
Creature of the night.
Then if anything grows (she laughs)
While you pose,
I'll oil you up
And rub you down"
380,"RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA, COLUMBIA",380,"Down, down down."
381,JANET,381,"And that's just one small fraction
Of the main attraction
You need a friendly hand.
Oh, and I need action.
Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me.
I wanna be dirty.
Thrill me, chil me, fulfil me.
Creature of the night."
382,COLUMBIA,382,"Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me."
383,MAGENTA,383,I wanna be dirty.
384,COLUMBIA,384,"Thrill me, chill me, fulfil me."
385,MAGENTA,385,Creature of the night.
386,JANET,386,"Oh, touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me.
I wanna be dirty.
Thrill me chill me, fulfil me - oh -
Creature of the night.
Creature of the ni-i-ight."
387,ROCKY,387,Creature of the night.
388,BRAD,388,Creature of the night.
389,FRANK,389,Creature of the night.
390,COLUMBIA,390,Creature of the night.
391,RIFF RAFF,391,Creature of the night.
392,MAGENTA,392,Creature of the night.
393,ROCKY,393,Creature of the night.
394,JANET,394,Creature of the night.  Oh.
395,RIFF RAFF,395,Aaaargh!  Mercy.
396,FRANK,396,"How did it happen?  I understood you
were to be watching."
397,RIFF RAFF,397,I was only away for a minute Master.
398,FRANK,398,"Well, see if you can find him on the monitor."
399,RIFF RAFF,399,"Master, we have a visitor."
400,BRAD,400,Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
401,RIFF RAFF,401,You know this earth - this person.
402,BRAD,402,"I most certainly do.  He happens to
be an old friend of mine."
403,FRANK,403,"I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance
meeting.  You came here with a purpose."
404,BRAD,404,"I told you, my car broke down."
405,BRAD,405,I was telling the truth.
406,FRANK,406,"I know what you told me, Brad.
But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name
is not unknown to me."
407,BRAD,407,He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
408,FRANK,408,"And now he works for your Government,
doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the
Bureau of Investigation of that which
you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?"
409,BRAD,409,He might be.  I don't know.
410,FRANK,410,Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
411,FRANK,411,"Well, let's ask him."
412,BRAD,412,Dr. Scott!
413,DR SCOTT,413,Brad!  What are you doing here?
414,FRANK,414,"Don't play games, Dr Scott.  You know
very well what Brad Majors's doing here.
It was part of your plan was it not that he,
and his female, should check the layout
for you.  Well, unfortunately for you all
there's to be a change of plans.  I'm sure
you're adaptable, Dr Scott.  I know Brad is."
415,DR SCOTT,415,"I can assure you that Brad's presence
comes as a complete surprise to me.
I came to find Eddie."
416,BRAD,416,Eddie?  I've seen him.  He's...
417,FRANK,417,"Eddie?  What do you know of Eddie,
Dr Scott?"
418,DR SCOTT,418,"I happen to know a great deal about a
lot of things.  You see Eddie happens
to be my nephew."
419,BRAD,419,Dr Scott.
420,DR SCOTT,420,Janet!
421,JANET,421,Dr Scott!
422,BRAD,422,Janet!
423,FRANK,423,Rocky!
424,FRANK,424,"Listen!  I made you, and I can break
you just as easily."
425,FRANK,425,That's better.
426,MAGENTA,426,"Master, dinner is prepared."
427,FRANK,427,"Excellent.  (moves to Dr. Scott)
Doctor Scott you can sample the
speciality of the house - roast
loin of pork."
428,FRANK,428,"Under the circumstances, formal
dress is to be optional."
429,NARRATOR,429,"Food has always played a vital role
in life's rituals.  The breaking of
bread - the last meal of the condemned
man - and now this meal.  However
informal it might appear you can be
sure there was to be very little
'bonhomie'."
430,FRANK,430,A toast to absent friends.
431,ALL,431,Absent friends.
432,DR. SCOTT,432,We came here to discuss Eddie.
433,COLUMBIA,433,Eddie!
434,FRANK (Silencing her with a gesture),434,"It's a rather tender subject....
Another slice anyone."
435,COLUMBIA,435,Excuse me.
436,DR. SCOTT (turning aside),436,"I knew he was in with a bad crowd.  But it
was worse than I imagined...(He turns back)
Aliens!"
437,BRAD & JANET,437,Dr. Scott!
438,FRANK,438,"Go on, Dr. Scott - or should I say
doctor von Scott."
439,BRAD,439,What exactly are you implying?
440,DR. SCOTT,440,That's alright Brad.
441,BRAD,441,But Doctor Scott...
442,DR. SCOTT,442,"From the day he was born,
he was trouble.
He was the thorn
In his mutter's side.
She tried in vain."
443,NARRATOR,443,"But he never caused her
Nothing but shame."
444,DR. SCOTT,444,"He left home the day she died.
From the day she was gone
All he wanted"
445,DR. SCOTT,445,"Was rock and roll,"
446,DR. SCOTT,446,Porn.
447,DR. SCOTT,447,Und a motorbike.
448,DR. SCOTT,448,Shooting up junk
449,DR. SCOTT,449,"He was a low down
Cheap little punk."
450,DR. SCOTT,450,Taking everyone for a ride.
451,ALL,451,"When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no good kid.
But when he threatened your life
With a switch blade knife"
452,FRANK,452,What a guy
453,JANET,453,Makes you cry
454,DR. SCOTT,454,Und I did.
455,COLUMBIA,455,"Everybody shoved him,
I very nearly loved him.
I said, hey listen to me,
Stay sane inside insanity.
But he locked the door
And threw away the key."
456,DR. SCOTT,456,"Making him warn, me,
In a note"
457,DR. SCOTT,457,Which reads.
458,ALL,458,"What's it say,
What's it say?"
459,EDDIE (VO),459,"I'm out of my head
Oh hurry, or I may be dead.
They mustn't carry out their evil deeds,
Yaaaow."
460,ALL,460,"When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no good kid."
461,DR. SCOTT,461,"Und when he threatened your life
With a switch blade knife"
462,FRANK,462,What guy
463,JANET,463,Makes you cry

465,ALL,465,Eddie!
466,ALL,466,"When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy

472,ALL,472,EDDIE!
473,FRANK,473,"Oh Rocky, how could you!"
474,FRANK,474,"I'll tell you once,
Won't tell you twice
You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss.
Y'apple pie
Don't taste too nice
You'd better wise up Janet Weiss."
475,FRANK,475,"I've laid the seed
It should be all you need."
476,FRANK,476,"You're as sensual
As a pencil
Wound up like an 'E' or first string"
477,FRANK,477,"When we made it
Did ya hear a bell ring?"
478,FRANK,478,"Y'got a block,
Take my advice.
You'd better wise up,
Janet Weiss."
479,FRANK,479,"The transducer (He slams the handle)
Will seduce yah."
480,JANET,480,My feet - I can' move my feet.
481,DR. SCOTT,481,"My wheels - My God, I can't
move my wheels."
482,BRAD,482,It's as if we were glued to the spot.
483,FRANK,483,"You are - so quake with fear,
you tiny fools."
484,JANET,484,We're trapped.
485,FRANK (Moving to her),485,"It's something you'll
Get used to.
A mental mind fuck
Can be nice."
486,JANET,486,Oh!
487,DR. SCOTT,487,"You won't find earth people quite
the easy mark you imagine.  This
sonic transducer - it is, I suppose,
some kind of audio-vibratory,
physiomolecular transport device...."
488,BRAD,488,You mean...
489,DR. SCOTT,489,"Yes Brad.  It's something we ourselves
have been working on.  But it
seems our friend here has found a
way of perfecting it.  A device
which is capable of breaking down
solid matter and then projecting it
through space, and - who knows -
perhaps even time itself!"
490,JANET,490,"You mean he's gonna send us to
another planet?"
491,FRANK,491,"Planet.
Schmanet.
Janet."
492,FRANK,492,"You'd better wise up,
Janet Weiss.
You'd better wise up,
Build your thighs up.
You'd better wise up."
493,NARRATOR,493,Then she cries out -
494,JANET,494,Sto-o-o-o-o-op.
495,FRANK (singing),495,"Don't get hot and flustered -
Use a bit of mustard."
496,BRAD,496,"You're a hot dog
But you'd better not
Try to hurt her,
Frank Furter."
497,DR. SCOTT,497,"You're a hot dog
But you'd better not
Try to hurt her,
Frank Furter."
498,JANET,498,You're a hot dog...
499,COLUMBIA,499,"My God!  I can't take any more of this -
first you spurn me for Eddie, then you
cast him off like an old overcoat for
Rocky.  You chew people up and then spit
them out - I loved you, do you hear me -
I LOVED YOU - And what did it get me -
I'll tell you - a big nothing.
You're like a sponge.  You take, take,
take, take!  You drain others of their
love and emotions.  Well, I've had enough.
You've got to choose between me and Rocky -
so named because of the rocks in his head."
500,FRANK,500,It's not easy having a good time.
501,FRANK,501,Even smiling makes my face ache.
502,FRANK,502,"My children turn on me.  Rocky's behaving
just as Eddie did.  Maybe I made a mistake
in splitting his brain between the two of
them."
503,MAGENTA,503,"When will we return to Transylvania?
I grow weary of this world."
504,FRANK,504,"Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both
you and your brother RIff Raff - you have
both served me well - loyalty such as
yours must be rewarded and you will
discover when the mood takes me I can
be quite generous."
505,MAGENTA,505,"I ask for nothing, Master."
506,FRANK,506,And you shall receive it - in abundance.
507,FRANK,507,Come.  We are ready for the floor show.
508,FRANK,508,Our guests will be growing restless.
509,NARRATOR,509,"And so, by some extraordinary coincidence -
fate it seems had decided that Brad and
Janet should keep that appointment with
their friend Dr Everett Scott.  But it was
to be in a situation which none of them
could have possibly foreseen.  And just a
few hours after announcing their engagement,
Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden
fruit.  This in itself was proof that their
host was a man of little morals - and some
persuasion.  What further indignities were
they to be subjected to?  And what of the
sonic transducer and floor show that had
been spoken of?  What indeed?  From what
had gone before, it was clear that this
was to be no picnic."
510,COLUMBIA,510,"It was great when it all began
I was a regular Frank fan.
But it was over when he had the plan
To start working on a muscle-man.
Now the only thing that gives me hope
Is my love of a certain dope
Rose tints my world keeps me
Safe from my trouble and pain."
511,ROCKY,511,"I'm just seven hours old
Truly beautiful to behold
And somebody should be told
My libido hasn't been controlled
Now the only thing I've come to trust
Is an orgasmicÊrush of lust
Rose tints my world keeps me
Safe from my trouble and pain."
512,BRAD,512,"It's beyond me
Help me Mommy
I'll be good you'll see
Take this dream away
What's this, let's see
I feel sexy
What's come over me
Here it comes again."
513,JANET,513,"I feel released
Bad times deceased
My confidence increased
Reality is here
The game has been disbanded
My mind has been expanded
It's a gas that Frankie's landed
His lust is so sincere."
514,FRANK,514,"What ever happened to Fay Wray
That delicate satin-draped frame
As it clung to her thigh
How I started to cry
For I wanted to be dressed just the same."
515,FRANK,515,"Give yourself over to absolutely pleasure
Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh
Erotic nightmares
Beyond any measure
And sensual daydreams
To treasure forever."
516,FRANK,516,"Can't you just see it.
Can't you just see it."
517,ALL,517,Don't dream it.  Be it.
518,DR. SCOTT,518,"Ach, we've got to get out of this trap
before this decadence saps our wills.
I've got to be strong and try to hang
on.  Or else my mind, may well snap."
519,DR. SCOTT,519,"Und my life will be lived,
For the thri-i-i-i-ill..."
520,BRAD,520,"It's beyond me
Help me Mo-ommy."
521,JANET,521,God bless Lilly Saint Cyr.
522,FRANK,522,"My my my my
I'm a wild and an untamed thing.
I'm a bee with a deadly sting.
Get a hit and your mind goes ping.
Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing.
So let the party and the sounds rock on.
Gonna shake it till the life has gone.
Rose tint my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain."
523,ALL,523,"I'm a wild and an untamed thing
I'm a bee with a deadly sting.
Get a hit and your mind goes ping
Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing."
524,ALL,524,"So let the part and the sounds rock on
Gonna shake it till the life has gone.
Rose tint my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain."
525,RIFF RAFF,525,"Frank N. Furter
It's all over
Your mission is a failure."
526,RIFF RAFF,526,Your life style's too extreme.
527,RIFF RAFF,527,"I'm your new Commander.
You are now my prisoner."
528,RIFF RAFF,528,We return to Transylvania
529,RIFF RAFF,529,Prepare the transit beam.
530,FRANK,530,Wait!  I can explain.
531,FRANK,531,On the day I went away.
532,GUESTS,532,Goodbye
533,FRANK,533,Was all I had to say
534,GUESTS,534,Now I
535,FRANK,535,Want to come again and stay
536,GUESTS,536,"Oh my, my,"
537,FRANK,537,Smile and that will mean I may
538,FRANK,538,"I've seen blue skies
Through the tears in my eyes
And I realise
I'm going home
I'm going home"
539,FRANK,539,Everywhere it's been the same
540,GUESTS,540,Feeling
541,FRANK,541,Like I'm outside in the rain
542,GUESTS,542,Wheeling
543,FRANK,543,Free to try and find a game
544,GUESTS,544,Dealing
545,FRANK,545,"Cards for sorrow,
Cards for pain."
546,FRANK,546,"I've seen blue skies
Through the tears in my eyes
And I realise
I'm going home
I'm going home.
I'm going home."
547,MAGENTA,547,How sentimental.
548,RIFF RAFF,548,"And also presumptuous of you.  You
see when I said ""we"" were to return
to Transylvania, I referred only to
Magenta and myself."
549,RIFF RAFF,549,"You see, you are to remain here,
in spirit anyway."
550,DR SCOTT,550,"Great Heavens, that's a laser."
551,RIFF RAFF,551,"Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of
emitting a beam of pure anti-matter."
552,BRAD,552,"You mean you're going to kill him?
What's his crime?"
553,DR SCOTT,553,"You saw what became of Eddie.
Society must be protected."
554,RIFF RAFF,554,"Exactly, Dr Scott.  Now Frank N.
Furter, your time has come.  Say
goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion."
555,FRANK,555,Do your worse - inferior one.
556,BRAD,556,Good God.
557,RIFF RAFF,557,Yes.
558,JANET,558,You've killed them.
559,MAGENTA,559,I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
560,RIFF RAFF,560,They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
561,DR SCOTT,561,You did right.
562,RIFF RAFF,562,A decision had to be made.
563,DR SCOTT,563,You're OK by me.
564,RIFF RAFF,564,Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
565,DR SCOTT,565,"Yes, well perhaps it was for the best."
566,RIFF RAFF,566,"You must leave now Dr Scott while it's
still possible.  We are about to beam
the entire house back to the planet of
transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania.
Go now."
567,RIFF RAFF,567,"Our noble mission is almost completed my
most beautiful sister, soon we will return
to the moon-drenched shores of our
""androgenous"" planet."
568,MAGENTA,568,"Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night -
to sing and dance once more to your dark
refrains.  To take that step to the right..."
569,RIFF RAFF,569,"But it's the pelvic thrust
that really drives you insane."
570,MAGENTA,570,"And our World will do
the Time Warp again."
571,BRAD,571,"I've done a lot
God knows I've tried
To find the truth I've even lied
But all I know is down inside."
572,BRAD & DR SCOTT,572,I'm bleeding.
573,JANET,573,"And super heroes
Come to feast
To taste the flesh
Not yet deceased
And al I know
Is still the beast"
574,TRIO,574,Is feeding.
575,NARRATOR,575,"And crawling on the planet's face
Some insects called the human race
Lost in time, and lost in space
And meaning."
576,VOICES OFF,576,Meaning.
577,VOICE OVER,577,"Science Fiction - double-feature
Frank has built and lost his creature
Darkness has conquered Brad and Janet
The servants gone to a distant planet
Oh - at the late night double-feature
Picture Show - I want to go - Ohh -
To the late night double-feature picture show."
