tribes settled on it and called it
Wakanda. The tribes lived in
constant war with each other until
a warrior shaman received a vision
from the Panther goddess Bast who
led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a
plant that granted him super human
strength , speed, and instincts."

develop technology more advanced

Wakandans vowed to hide in plain
