we're gonna use their own strategy

power, and their children and
anyone else who takes their side .

from the shadows . We cannot , we
must not. We will work to be an
example of how we as brothers and
sisters on this Earth should treat
each other . Now more than ever ,
illusions of division threaten our
very e x istence. We all know the
truth : more connects us than
separates us . In times of crisis ,
the wise build bridges , while the
foolish build barriers . We must
find a way to look after one
another, as if we were one single
tribe ."
