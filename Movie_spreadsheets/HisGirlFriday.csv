Room? Just a moment, I'll connect
you."

Just a moment --"
2,OFFICE BOY,2,What's a seven-letter word for --?
3,REPORTER,3,"Don't ask me! If I knew any seven-
letter words, I'd be something better
than a reporter!"
4,REPORTER,4,Hey! Down! Down!
5,HILDY,5,"Hello, Skinny. Remember me?"
6,OFFICE BOY,6,Hildy Johnson!
7,HILDY,7,"Hello, Maisie."
8,MAISIE,8,Hello -- Hildy! You coming back?
9,HILDY,9,"No, just visiting. Tell me, is the
lord of the universe in today?"
10,MAISIE,10,"He is -- and in a very bad humor. I
think somebody stole one of his crown
jewels. Shall I announce you?"
11,HILDY,11,"No, never mind -- I'll blow my own
trumpet."
12,HILDY,12,"I won't be more than ten minutes, I
promise you."
13,BRUCE,13,"Even ten minutes is a long time to
be away from you."
14,HILDY,14,"What did you say, Bruce?"
15,BRUCE,15,"I said -- uh -- I said even ten
minutes -- is a long time -- to be
away from you."
16,HILDY,16,"Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard
it, but I just wanted to hear it
again. I can stand being spoiled a
little. The gentleman I'm going to
have a chat with did very little
spoiling."
17,BRUCE,17,"I'd like to spoil him just once.
Sure you don't want me to go in with
you?"
18,HILDY,18,"My job, Bruce. I started it -- and
I'll finish it."
19,BRUCE,19,"I suppose you're right -- but if it
gets rough, remember I'm here."
20,HILDY,20,"I'll come a-running, pardner."
21,HILDY,21,"Thanks, Bruce."
22,HILDY,22,"Hello, Beatrice. How's ""Advice to
the Lovelorn""?"
23,BEATRICE,23,"Hildy! I'll be a monkey's uncle!
What are you doing here?"
24,HILDY,24,"Point of information -- what does a
girl say on meeting her divorced
husband? OR:"
25,BEATRICE,25,"My advice is duck and cross with
your right."
26,LOUIE,26,"A little more round the chin, Boss."
27,BURNS,27,What do you want?
28,HILDY,28,"Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's
no way to talk to your wife -- even
if she's no longer your wife."
29,BURNS,29,"Hello, Hildy!"
30,HILDY,30,"Hello, Walter."
31,HILDY,31,"Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine
king?"
32,LOUIE,32,"Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm
retired. I'm one of you fellas now --
a newspaper man."
33,HILDY,33,Editorials?
34,BURNS,34,"Get going, Louie. I got company."
35,DUFFY,35,Walter!
36,BURNS,36,"I'm busy, Duffy."
37,DUFFY,37,"Well, you're not too busy to know
that the Governor hasn't signed that
reprieve!"
38,BURNS,38,What?
39,DUFFY,39,"And that means Earl Williams dies
tomorrow morning and makes a sucker
out of us!"
40,BURNS,40,You're crazy. Where's Mac?
41,DUFFY,41,He's on my phone. He just called me.
42,BURNS,42,They can't do that to me!
43,BURNS,43,"Give me that call on Duffy's wire!
Hello -- Mac? Burns. Where's the
Governor? -- What do you mean, you
can't locate him?"
44,BURNS,44,"Mac, you know what this means. We're
the only paper in town defending
Earl Williams and if he hangs tomorrow
we're washed up! Find the Governor
and when you find him tell him we
want that reprieve!... Tell him I
elected him and I can have him
impeached! Sure, you can do it, Mac --
I know you can. I always said you
were the greatest reporter in the
country and now you can prove it.
Get going! Attaboy!"
45,BURNS,45,"The greatest reporter in the country!
First I gotta tell him what news to
get! Gotta tell him how to get it --
then I gotta write it for him
afterward! Now if you were a decent
City Editor --"
46,DUFFY,46,"Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in
name only. You do all the hiring
around here."
47,BURNS,47,"Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too.
Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a
civil tongue in your head."
48,HILDY,48,"I don't like to interfere with
business, but would you boys pardon
us while we have a little heart-to-
heart talk?"
49,DUFFY AND LOUIE,49,Well -- But I gotta --
50,BURNS,50,"Scram, you guys."
51,HILDY,51,"You won't miss anything. You'll
probably be able to hear him just as
well outside as here."
52,HILDY,52,Mind if I sit down?
53,BURNS' VOICE,53,I said scram!
54,HILDY,54,"May I have a cigarette, please?"
55,HILDY,55,Thanks. A match?
56,BURNS,56,How long is it?
57,HILDY,57,How long is what?
58,BURNS,58,"You know what. How long since we've
seen each other?"
59,HILDY,59,"Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks --
then Bermuda... Oh, about four months,
I guess. Seems like yesterday to me."
60,BURNS,60,"Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing
me in your dreams?"
61,HILDY,61,"No -- Mama doesn't dream about you
any more, Walter. You wouldn't know
the old girl now."
62,BURNS,62,"Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any
time --"
63,BURNS AND HILDY,63,"-- any place, anywhere --"
64,HILDY,64,"You're repeating yourself! That's
the speech you made the night you
proposed."
65,HILDY,65,"""-- any time -- any place --
anywhere!"""
66,BURNS,66,I notice you still remember it.
67,HILDY,67,"I'll always remember it. If I hadn't
remembered it, I wouldn't have
divorced you."
68,BURNS,68,"You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you
hadn't done it."
69,HILDY,69,Done what?
70,BURNS,70,"Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow
lose faith in himself. It almost
gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted."
71,HILDY,71,"Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's
what divorces are for."
72,BURNS,72,"Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned
idea that divorces are something
that last forever -- till 'death us
do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't
mean anything today. It's only a few
words mumbled over you by a judge.
We've got something between us nothing
can change."
73,HILDY,73,"I suppose that's true in a way. I am
fond of you, Walter. I often wish
you weren't such a stinker."
74,BURNS,74,"Now, that's a nice thing to say."
75,HILDY,75,"Well, why did you promise me you
wouldn't fight the divorce and then
try and gum up the whole works?"
76,BURNS,76,"Well, I meant to let you go -- but,
you know, you never miss the water
till the well runs dry."
77,HILDY,77,"A fellow your age, hiring an airplane
to write:"
78,HILDY,78,"'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember
my dimple. Walter.! It held things
up twenty minutes while the Judge
ran out to watch it."
79,BURNS,79,"Well, I don't want to brag, but I've
still got the dimple -- and in the
same place -- I just acted like any
husband who doesn't want to see his
home broken up."
80,HILDY,80,What home?
81,WALTER,81,"What home? Don't you remember the
home I promised you?"
82,HILDY,82,"Oh, yes -- we were to have it right
after our honeymoon -- honeymoon!"
83,BURNS,83,"Was it my fault? Did I know that
coal mine was going to have another
cave-in? I meant to be with you on
our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I
did."
84,HILDY,84,"All I know is that instead of two
weeks in Atlantic City with my
bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a
coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age
sixty-three -- getting food and air
out of a tube! You don't deny that.
Do you?"
85,BURNS,85,"Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat
the whole country on that story."
86,HILDY,86,"Well, suppose we did? That isn't
what I got married for. What's the
good of -- Look, Walter, I came up
here to tell you that you'll have to
stop phoning me a dozen times a day --
sending twenty telegrams -- all the
rest of it, because I'm --"
87,BURNS,87,"Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you
what. You come back to work on the
paper and if we find we can't get
along in a friendly way, we'll get
married again."
88,HILDY,88,What?!!
89,BURNS,89,I haven't any hard feelings.
90,HILDY,90,"Walter, you're wonderful in a
loathesome sort of way. Now, would
you mind keeping quiet long enough
for me to tell you what I came up
here for?"
91,BURNS,91,"Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch
and you can tell me everything."
92,HILDY,92,I have a lunch date. I just want --
93,BURNS,93,"You can break it, can't you?"
94,HILDY,94,"No, I can't."
95,BURNS,95,Sure you can. Come on.
96,HILDY,96,"Don't tell me what to do! We're
divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're
not my husband and you're not my
boss! And what's more, you're not
going to be my boss."
97,BURNS,97,What do you mean by that?
98,HILDY,98,Just what I said. That's what I --
99,BURNS,99,"You mean you're not coming back to
work here?"
100,HILDY,100,"That's the first time you've been
right today. That's what I --"
101,BURNS,101,"You've had a better offer, eh?"
102,HILDY,102,You bet I've got a better offer.
103,BURNS,103,"Well, go on and take it. Work for
somebody else! That's the gratitude
I get for --"
104,HILDY,104,"I know, Walter, but I --"
105,BURNS,105,"What were you when you came here
five years ago? A little college
girl from a School of Journalism! I
took a little doll-faced mugg --"
106,HILDY,106,"You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't
been doll-faced!"
107,BURNS,107,"Why should I? I thought it would be
a novelty to have a face around here
a man could look at without
shuddering."
108,HILDY,108,"Listen, Walter --"
109,BURNS,109,"I made a great reporter out of you,
Hildy, but you won't be half as good
on any other paper, and you know it.
You need me and I need you -- and
the paper needs both of us."
110,HILDY,110,"Well, the paper'll have to learn to
do without me. And so will you. It
just didn't work out, Walter."
111,BURNS,111,"It would have worked if you'd been
satisfied with just being editor and
reporter. But no! You had to marry
me and spoil everything."
112,HILDY,112,"I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I
proposed to you!"
113,BURNS,113,"Well, you practically did! Making
goo-goo eyes at me for two years
till I broke down. And I still claim
I was tight the night I proposed. If
you'd been a gentleman you'd have
forgotten all about it. But not you!"
114,HILDY,114,You -- you --
115,BURNS,115,"You're losing your eye. You used to
be able to pitch better than that."
116,BURNS,116,"Hello... Yeah... What? Sweeney? Well,
what can I do for you?"
117,DUFFY,117,"What's the matter with you? Are you
drunk? This is Duffy, not Sweeney!"
118,BURNS,118,"Sweeney! You can't do that to me!
Not today, of all days! Jumping
Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well,
I suppose so... All right. If you
have to, you have to."
119,BURNS,119,"How do you like that? Everything
happens to me -- with 365 days in
the year -- this has to be the day."
120,HILDY,120,What's the matter?
121,BURNS,121,Sweeney.
122,HILDY,122,Dead?
123,BURNS,123,"Not yet. Might just as well be. The
only man on the paper who can write --
and his wife picks this morning to
have a baby!"
124,HILDY,124,Sweeney?
125,HILDY,125,"Well, after all, he didn't do it on
purpose, did he?"
126,BURNS,126,"I don't care whether he did or not.
He's supposed to be covering the
Earl Williams case and there he is --
waiting at the hospital! Is there no
sense of honor left in this country?"
127,HILDY,127,"Well, haven't you got anybody else?"
128,BURNS,128,"There's nobody else on the paper who
can write! This'll break me, unless --"
129,BURNS,129,Hildy!
130,HILDY,130,No!
131,BURNS,131,"You've got to help me, Hildy."
132,HILDY,132,Keep away --
133,BURNS,133,"It'll bring us together again, Hildy --
just the way we used to be."
134,HILDY,134,"That's what I'm afraid of. ""Any time --
any place -- anywhere!"""
135,BURNS,135,"Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger
than anything that's happened to us.
Don't do it for me! Do it for the
paper."
136,HILDY,136,"Get away, Svengali."
137,BURNS,137,"If you won't do it for love, how
about money? Forget the other offer
and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks
a week."
138,HILDY,138,"Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --"
139,BURNS,139,"All right -- thirty-five, and not a
cent more!"
140,HILDY,140,Please! Will you just --
141,BURNS,141,"Great grief! What's that other paper
going to give you?"
142,HILDY,142,I'm not working for any other paper!
143,BURNS,143,"Oh! In that case, the raise is off
and you go back to your old salary
and like it. Trying to blackjack --"
144,HILDY,144,Look at this!
145,HILDY,145,"Do you see this? Do you know what an
engagement ring is?"
146,HILDY,146,"I tried to tell you right away but
you started reminiscing. I'm getting
married, Walter, and also getting as
far away from the newspaper business
as I can get! I'm through."
147,BURNS,147,"Get married all you want to, Hildy,
but you can't quit the newspaper
business."
148,HILDY,148,"You can't sell me that, Walter."
149,BURNS,149,"Who says I can't? You're a newspaper
man."
150,HILDY,150,"That's why I'm quitting. I want to
go some place where I can be a woman."
151,BURNS,151,"I know you, Hildy, and I know what
it would mean. It would kill you."
152,HILDY,152,"A journalist! Peeking through keyholes --
running after fire engines -- waking
people up in the middle of the night
to ask them if they think Hitler's
going to start a war -- stealing
pictures off old ladies of their
daughters that got chased by apemen!
I know all about reporters -- a lot
of daffy buttinskies going around
without a nickel in their pockets,
and for what? So a million hired
girls and motormen's wives will know
what's going on! No, Walter, I'm
through."
153,BURNS,153,Where'd you meet this man?
154,HILDY,154,Bermuda.
155,BURNS,155,"Bermuda... Rich, eh?"
156,HILDY,156,"Not what you'd call rich. Makes about
five thousand a year."
157,BURNS,157,What's his line?
158,HILDY,158,He's in the insurance business.
159,BURNS,159,The insurance business?
160,HILDY,160,"It's a good, honest business, isn't
it?"
161,BURNS,161,"Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I
can't picture you with a guy who
sells policies."
162,HILDY,162,"Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets
the office when he's with me. He
doesn't treat me like an errand-boy --
he treats me like a woman."
163,BURNS,163,"He does, does he? How did I treat
you -- like a water buffalo?"
164,HILDY,164,"I don't know about water buffaloes,
but I know about him. He's kind and
sweet and considerate. He wants a
home -- and children."
165,BURNS,165,"Say, sounds more like a guy I ought
to marry. What's his name?"
166,HILDY,166,"Well, I'll give you a hint. By
tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs.
Bruce Baldwin."
167,BURNS,167,"Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as
that?"
168,HILDY,168,"The quicker the better. Well -- I
finally got out what I came in to
tell you."
169,HILDY,169,"So long, Walter, and better luck
next time."
170,BURNS,170,"I wish you everything I couldn't
give you, Hildy."
171,HILDY,171,Thanks...
172,BURNS,172,"Too bad I couldn't see this guy first.
I'm pretty particular about whom my
wife marries."
173,HILDY,173,"Well, he's waiting in the anteroom
for me now."
174,BURNS,174,"Say, could I meet him?"
175,HILDY,175,"Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do
any good."
176,BURNS,176,"You're not afraid, are you?"
177,HILDY,177,Afraid? I should say not!
178,BURNS,178,"All right then, come on and let's
see this paragon."
179,BURNS,179,Is he as good as you say?
180,HILDY,180,Better.
181,BURNS,181,Then what does he want with you?
182,HILDY,182,Now you got me.
183,BURNS,183,Nothing personal. I was just asking.
184,BURNS,184,After all --
185,HILDY,185,"You wouldn't believe this, Walter,
but Bruce holds the door open for
me."
186,BURNS,186,No kidding?
187,HILDY,187,"And he takes his hat off when he's
with a lady."
188,BURNS,188,What for?
189,HILDY,189,"And when he walks with a lady, he
waits for her!"
190,BURNS,190,"Oh, I'm sorry."
191,BURNS,191,"Have Duffy call me in the restaurant
in twenty minutes."
192,HILDY,192,Allow me.
193,BURNS,193,Thanks.
194,BURNS,194,"I can see right away my wife picked
out the right husband for herself."
195,MESSENGER,195,"There must be some mistake. I'm
already married."
196,BURNS,196,Already married!
197,BURNS,197,"Hildy, why didn't you tell me?"
198,BURNS,198,"Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin!"
199,MESSENGER,199,But my name --
200,BRUCE,200,Mr. Burns!
201,BURNS,201,"Yeah? You'll have to excuse me --
I'm busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here.
Just leave your card with the boy."
202,BURNS,202,"I'm very sorry, but I'm busy! Look --"
203,BURNS,203,"-- there's the boy. Take your card
and leave it with him."
204,BRUCE,204,Mr. Burns --
205,BURNS,205,"I've just told you I was busy with
Mr. Bruce Baldwin!"
206,BRUCE,206,I'm Bruce Baldwin!
207,BURNS,207,You're Bruce Baldwin?
208,BRUCE,208,Yes!
209,BURNS,209,Then who are you?
210,MESSENGER,210,My name's Pete Davis.
211,BURNS,211,"Pete Davis! Well, Mr. Davis, this is
no concern of yours and after this
I'll thank you to keep out of my
affairs!"
212,BURNS,212,"This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and
I'm sorry about the mistake."
213,BURNS,213,"Oh, I thought there was something
funny... You see, Bruce, you don't
mind if I call you Bruce, do you?
After all, we're practically related --"
214,BRUCE,214,"Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at
all."
215,BURNS,215,"You see, my wife -- I mean, your
wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had
led me to expect that she was marrying
a much older man."
216,BRUCE,216,Oh.
217,BURNS,217,"But I see, she didn't mean old in
years. You always carry an umbrella,
Bruce?"
218,BRUCE,218,"Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy
this morning."
219,BURNS,219,"That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I
hope? A man ought to be prepared for
any emergency."
220,BURNS,220,Attaboy!
221,BURNS,221,"Come on, Bruce."
222,BRUCE,222,Where are we going?
223,BURNS,223,"Where are we going? I'm going to buy
you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell
you?"
224,BRUCE,224,No -- she didn't.
225,BURNS,225,"Just wanted to surprise you, I guess."
226,BURNS,226,Down!
227,BURNS,227,"After you, Bruce!"
228,BURNS,228,"Come on, Hildy, my treat!"
229,HILDY,229,"I suppose I can't call this off
without creating a scene -- but
remember, it's your last fling."
230,BURNS,230,"How do you like that? Here I am being
nice to you and your sweet-heart and
that's the thanks I get!"
231,BURNS,231,"Oh -- after you, Hildy!"
232,WAITER,232,"Don't tell me it's you, Hildy!"
233,HILDY,233,Nobody else.
234,HILDY,234,"How's everything, Gus?"
235,GUS,235,I can't complain.
236,BURNS,236,"Well, I can. I'm hungry. Roast beef
sandwich -- rare. And some coffee."
237,GUS,237,"Shall I put a little rum in the
coffee? It's a nasty day."
238,BURNS,238,"Good idea. How about you, Hildy?"
239,HILDY,239,"Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess.
And coffee."
240,GUS,240,"Little rum in yours, too?"
241,HILDY,241,I guess so.
242,HILDY,242,"No -- just coffee, Gus."
243,GUS,243,Just coffee.
244,GUS,244,"And you, sir?"
245,BRUCE,245,"Oh, I'll take the same, I guess. And
a glass of milk."
246,GUS,246,Milk?
247,BRUCE,247,Yes.
248,GUS,248,Milk.
249,BURNS,249,"And don't put any rum in it, Gus."
250,BURNS,250,"Well, so you're getting married
tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?"
251,BRUCE,251,"Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're
taking the four o'clock train to
Albany and tomorrow we'll be married."
252,BURNS,252,"Taking the train today -- and being
married tomorrow?"
253,BRUCE,253,"Oh, it isn't like that."
254,HILDY,254,"It will be perfectly all right,
Walter. Mother is coming with us on
the train."
255,BURNS,255,Mother? But your mother --
256,BRUCE,256,No. My mother.
257,BURNS,257,"Oh. Your mother -- well, of course,
that relieves my mind."
258,HILDY,258,"Isn't it sweet of Walter -- still
wanting to protect me?"
259,BURNS,259,"I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy,
but you can always count on me."
260,BRUCE,260,"I don't think she'll need you very
much -- I aim to do most of the
protecting myself."
261,BURNS,261,"Well, I'll tell you one thing, old
man, she never looked at me the way
she's looking at you."
262,HILDY,262,"I might have, Walter, but you were
never there."
263,BURNS,263,"Anyway, I'm glad you two are going
to be happy and have all the things
I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy
is about the best reporter in the
country -- and that goes regardless
of sex. But all she really ever wanted
was a home."
264,BRUCE,264,"Well, I'll try to give her one."
265,BURNS,265,"I know you will, Bruce. Are you going
to live with your mother?"
266,BRUCE,266,Just for the first year.
267,BURNS,267,"That'll be nice. A home with mother.
A real honeymoon. In Albany, too.
Ow!"
268,BRUCE,268,"Mighty nice little town, Albany.
They've got the State Capitol there,
you know."
269,BURNS,269,"Yes, I know..."
270,BURNS,270,"Hildy, will you ever forget the night
you brought the Governor back to
your hotel room and found me taking
a bath? She didn't even know I was
in town..."
271,GUS,271,"Well, here we are."
272,BURNS,272,"How's business, Bruce?"
273,BRUCE,273,"Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance
town. Most people there take it out
pretty early in life."
274,BURNS,274,I don't blame them.
275,HILDY,275,"Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must
have slipped."
276,GUS,276,That's all right.
277,BURNS,277,"I sometimes wish I'd taken out
insurance -- but, of course, now it
doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it
would have been the smart thing to
do."
278,BRUCE,278,"Well, I honestly feel that way. I
figure I'm in one line of business
that really helps people. Of course,
we don't help you much when you're
alive -- but afterward -- that's
what counts."
279,BURNS,279,I see what you mean.
280,HILDY,280,"Gus, this --"
281,GUS,281,"Good coffee, isn't it?"
282,BRUCE,282,You've forgotten my milk.
283,GUS,283,Oh. The milk. Yes.
284,BURNS,284,"Here's luck to the bride and
bridegroom."
285,HILDY,285,Thank you.
286,BRUCE,286,He hasn't brought my milk yet.
287,BUS BOY,287,"They want you on the phone, Mr. Burns."
288,BURNS,288,They would!
289,BRUCE,289,"You know, Hildy, he's not a bad
fellow."
290,HILDY,290,"You're so nice, Bruce, you think
everybody else is."
291,BRUCE,291,"Oh, he's not the man for you. I can
see that. But I sort of like him.
Got a lot of charm."
292,HILDY,292,"He comes by it naturally. His
grandfather was a snake."
293,BRUCE,293,"If anybody had told me I'd be sitting
at lunch with him -- but he swept me
right off my feet."
294,HILDY,294,"That's what he did to me. Swept me
right off my feet -- and left me
lying on the floor."
295,BURNS,295,"Get this -- get Sweeney off that
yarn and out of town on a two weeks'
vacation -- and right away... All
right, Duffy, keep your shirt on.
Hildy's coming back... No. She doesn't
know it yet. But she'll be there. I
promise you, Duffy. And tell Louie
to stick around."
296,GUS,296,"Your milk, sir."
297,GUS,297,"And I brought you another cup of
coffee, Hildy."
298,HILDY,298,"Thanks, Gus."
299,BRUCE,299,Too hot?
300,HILDY,300,No. It's strong.
301,HILDY,301,But I like it that way.
302,BRUCE,302,"Say, what's happened to Burns? He
looks sunk, doesn't he?"
303,HILDY,303,He certainly -- hic -- does!
304,BRUCE,304,Anything the matter?
305,BURNS,305,"Just Sweeney again. One of my best
reporters."
306,HILDY,306,What now?
307,BURNS,307,"His wife had twins and he went out
to celebrate and got as drunk as a
lord. They can't even find him."
308,BURNS,308,"I tell you, drink is the ruin of
this nation."
309,HILDY,309,You said it.
310,BURNS,310,"So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl
Williams gets hanged tomorrow."
311,BRUCE,311,Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
312,BURNS,312,"It's simple. A poor little dope who
lost his job went berserk and shot a
cop who was coming after him to quiet
him down."
313,HILDY,313,"If he's nuts, why doesn't the State
just put him away?"
314,BURNS,314,"Because it happened to be a colored
policeman."
315,HILDY,315,"The colored vote happens to be very
important to the Mayor of this town."
316,BURNS,316,"Especially with an election coming
up in a few days."
317,BRUCE,317,"Are you sure Williams is not all
there?"
318,BURNS,318,"All you've got to do is talk to him.
But the Mayor would hang his own
grandmother to be re-elected."
319,BRUCE,319,"But couldn't you show the man wasn't
responsible?"
320,BURNS,320,How?
321,HILDY'S VOICE,321,"You could run an interview that would
prove it. Remember the interview I
wrote with Jimmy Wellman? That saved
his life."
322,BURNS,322,"Yes, you could do it, Hildy. You
could save that poor devil's life.
You could -- but --"
323,BURNS,323,-- you're going away. I forgot.
324,BRUCE,324,How long would the interview take?
325,BURNS,325,"Oh -- an hour for the interview.
Another hour to write it."
326,BRUCE,326,"We could take the six o'clock train,
Hildy. If it would save a man's life."
327,HILDY,327,"No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This
is a trick to get your sympathy. No,
Walter, I've been waiting for
something like this -- but I wasn't
sure when you'd spring it. If you
want to save Earl Williams' life,
you can interview him yourself. You're
still a good reporter. Bruce and I
will be on that four o'clock train --
and thanks just the same."
328,BURNS,328,"I'm an editor. I know what ought to
be written, but I can't write it the
way you could. It needs a woman's
heart --"
329,HILDY,329,"Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!"
330,BURNS,330,"You see what I had to put up with?
She never trusted me! You argue with
her -- otherwise you're going on a
honeymoon with blood on your hands!"
331,BURNS,331,"How can you have any happiness after
that? All through the years you'll
remember that a man went to the
gallows because you were too selfish
to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl
Williams' face will come between you
on the train tonight -- and at the
preacher's tomorrow -- and all the
rest of your lives!"
332,HILDY,332,"What a performance! Bravo! Don't let
him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an
act!"
333,BURNS,333,"What do you mean, only an act? Haven't
you got any feeling?"
334,HILDY,334,"Well, it's either an act on your
part or a miracle on Sweeney's."
335,BURNS,335,What do you mean?
336,HILDY,336,"I happen to know Sweeney was married
only three months ago. If he's got
twins this morning, I claim it was
done with mirrors."
337,BURNS,337,"All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But
I'll make you and Bruce a business
proposition."
338,HILDY,338,We're not interested.
339,BURNS,339,"Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young
man. You let Hildy do this story for
me and you can write out a $100,000.00
insurance policy for me. What do you
say?"
340,BRUCE,340,"I don't use my wife for business
purposes, Mr. Burns!"
341,HILDY,341,"Wait a minute, Bruce. What's
commission on a $100,000.00 policy?"
342,BRUCE,342,"Well, at his age, twenty payment
life, a little over a thousand
dollars."
343,HILDY,343,"And what's the matter with a thousand
dollars?"
344,BRUCE,344,But --
345,HILDY,345,"According to the budget, we laid out
that's more than our food bill for a
whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't
want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm
perfectly willing to use him. How
long will it take to get him examined?"
346,BRUCE,346,"I could get a company doctor in twenty
minutes."
347,BURNS,347,Now you're talking!
348,HILDY,348,"You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose
you examine Mr. Burns in his office.
I'll get my bag and go over to the
Press Room in the Criminal Courts
Building. You phone me as soon as
Mr. Burns has given you his check.
Then I'll go get the interview and
you phone Mother that we're taking
the six o'clock train."
349,HILDY,349,"And no tricks, Walter!"
350,BURNS,350,What tricks would I pull?
351,HILDY,351,"Oh, nothing! Of course, you might
cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute!
What would be his first payment on
that policy?"
352,BRUCE,352,About twenty-five hundred dollars.
353,HILDY,353,"Better make that a certified check,
Walter."
354,BURNS,354,What do you think I am -- a crook?
355,HILDY,355,"Yes --- and that's putting it mildly!
No certified check -- no story --
Get me?"
356,BURNS,356,"All right. The check will be
certified. Want my fingerprints?"
357,HILDY,357,"No thanks, I've still got those.
Well, I'll step into some working
clothes and hop over to the Press
Room for the background on this yarn.
It'll be kind of fun to see the boys
again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must
be certified."
358,BRUCE,358,"All right, dear."
359,HILDY,359,"Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got
that money?"
360,BRUCE,360,The five hundred? Sure.
361,HILDY,361,"On second thought, would you let me
have it? I'll get the tickets."
362,BRUCE,362,But --
363,HILDY,363,"Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm
doing. He'd get you in a crap game --"
364,BRUCE,364,"But I don't gamble, Hilda!"
365,HILDY,365,"I know a lot of men who didn't do
anything till they met Walter Burns.
Please, dear."
366,BRUCE,366,All right.
367,BRUCE,367,"One -- two -- three -- four -- five.
Five hundred. Be careful, honey."
368,HILDY,368,"I'll be careful, darling. You be,
please."
369,HILDY,369,"So long, husbands."
370,BRUCE,370,"I never knew Hildy to be so determined
before."
371,BURNS,371,You haven't seen anything yet.
372,ENDICOTT,372,"Criminal Courts Press Room... This
is Endicott... No, nothing new on
the Williams case yet boss. Well,
you bet I'm here plugging away every
minute."
373,ENDICOTT,373,Up a dime.
374,MURPHY,374,By me.
375,WILSON,375,Droparoo.
376,MCCUE,376,I'll call.
377,ENDICOTT,377,Three sixes. Is that any good?
378,HILDY'S VOICE,378,It sure looks good from here.
379,HILDY,379,"One at a time, boys."
380,HILDY,380,"No, I'm not back for good. I'm just
covering the Earl Williams story for
Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack
of something but will be all right
by tomorrow. No, I haven't made up
with Walter Burns -- far from it! As
a matter of fact, I'm leaving tonight
for Albany and I'll be married
tomorrow morning. The lucky man is
Mr. Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in
the insurance business -- and when I
say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are
there any other questions?"
381,ENDICOTT,381,"Well, that about covers everything."
382,HILDY,382,"Good. Now I want to ask you fellows
a couple of questions. Did Earl
Williams know what he was doing when
he fired that gun?"
383,MURPHY,383,"If you ask us, no. If you ask the
state alienists, the answer is yes."
384,MCCUE,384,"It's a simple story. Earl Williams
works for the E.J. McClosky
Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper
for fourteen years. He starts in at
twenty dollars a week and gradually
works his way up to twenty-two fifty.
A year ago the McClosky Company goes
out of business and Williams loses
his job."
385,MCCUE,385,"Take it away, Fred Wilson!"
386,WILSON,386,"Well -- Williams goes a little balmy
and begins making speeches on a plan
he's got to save the world. Only he
makes his speeches, usually, on a
very busy street and neglects to get
a license for it. Well, the cops let
him alone as much as they can because
he's harmless and they're kinda sorry
for him. But one day he decides to
hold a meeting right in the middle
of a Veteran's Parade and the cops
chase him. He gets scared and goes
into hiding."
387,WILSON,387,"Come in, Dave Schwartz."
388,SCHWARTZ,388,"His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out
with a statement that Earl Williams
is a dangerous character in the employ
of two or three foreign governments
and the police are going to get him
dead or alive. Somebody sends out a
tip that this guy is hiding in Molly
Malloy's joint. And this colored
policeman, Daniels, goes over to
pick Williams up. Williams has read
the papers, thinks the cop is going
to kill him and shoots first. That
is all."
389,HILDY,389,"Thanks, boys. That's all I want to
know."
390,ENDICOTT,390,"Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's
desk."
391,HILDY,391,"I know, I just want to give him a
thrill."
392,HILDY,392,"All right, boys, now that everything
is settled, deal me in."
393,HILDY,393,"Hello, this is Hildy Johnson. Get me
Walter Burns."
394,HILDY,394,"Hello, Walter. How's the old double-
crosser?"
395,BURNS,395,"Hello, my fine-feathered friend.
Thought I might be hearing from you.
What have you got to report?"
396,BURNS,396,"Going all right, eh?"
397,DOCTOR,397,Fine.
398,BURNS,398,"Doctor, will you please keep quiet a
minute? How do you expect me to get
any work done?"
399,DOCTOR,399,"How do you expect me to get anywhere
if you're going to keep on that phone?
If you'll just give me two minutes
more --"
400,BURNS,400,"Well, they haven't finished with me
yet but I'm hoping to get my shirt
back. Oh, no. I'm in the pink of
condition. They found two new dimples."
401,HILDY,401,"How about that check? All right, Mr.
Burns, but remember, no checkee --
no story. Well, as soon as they decide
whether you live or not will you
have that new man of mine call me
up? Yes, sir."
402,HILDY,402,"All right, boys. Up a dime."
403,ENDICOTT'S VOICE,403,Right back at you.
404,MCCUE,404,You fight it cut.
405,HILDY,405,And up a dime.
406,ENDICOTT,406,I call. What you got?
407,HILDY,407,Three bullets! Any good?
408,ENDICOTT,408,Beats king up.
409,MCCUE,409,"What are you going to do with all
that money, Hildy?"
410,WILSON,410,Yeah -- you can't spend it in Albany.
411,HILDY,411,"Oh, I'll think of something."
412,MURPHY,412,"Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on
the hanging?"
413,BENSINGER,413,"Why don't you fellows get your own
news?"
414,HILDY,414,Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
415,BENSINGER,415,Hildy!
416,BENSINGER,416,Are you back?
417,HILDY,417,"No, just a farewell appearance,
batting for Sweeney. I'm going into
business for myself."
418,BENSINGER,418,What doing?
419,HILDY,419,I'm getting married tomorrow.
420,BENSINGER,420,"Well, congratulations! Good luck!"
421,ENDICOTT,421,"Why don't you use him for a
bridesmaid, Hildy?"
422,SCHWARTZ,422,"Come on, Hildy, your deal."
423,BENSINGER,423,"Say, who put these stockings in my
desk?"
424,BENSINGER,424,"This is Bensinger. I just saw the
Sheriff. He won't move the hanging
up a minute... All right, I'll talk
to him again, but it's no use. The
execution is set for seven in the
morning. Get me a rewrite man."
425,ENDICOTT,425,"Why can't they hang that guy at a
reasonable hour, so we can get some
sleep?"
426,BENSINGER,426,"Jake, new lead on the hanging. This
new alienist from New York -- Dr.
Max J. Egelhoffer -- is going to
interview Williams in about half an
hour -- in the Sheriff's office."
427,MURPHY,427,"That must be the tenth alienist
they've had on Williams. Even if he
wasn't crazy before, he would be
after ten of those babies got through
psychoanalyzing him."
428,MURPHY,428,Gimme the desk.
429,ENDICOTT,429,This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
430,MURPHY,430,"Yeah? What did he ever do for his
country?"
431,ENDICOTT,431,"Don't you remember? He's the guy
went to Washington to interview the
Brain Trust, and gave out a statement
that they were all sane. It created
a sensation!"
432,BENSINGER,432,"Here's the situation on the eve of
the hanging:"
433,MURPHY,433,"This is Murphy. More slop on the
hanging."
434,BENSINGER,434,"A double guard's been thrown around
the jail, municipal buildings,
railroad terminals, and elevated
stations to prepare for the expected
general uprising of radicals at the
hour of execution."
435,MURPHY,435,"Ready? The Sheriff's just put two
hundred more relatives on the payroll
to protect the city against the Red
Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a
couple of minutes."
436,MURPHY,436,Up a dime.
437,BENSINGER,437,"The Sheriff has just received four
more letters threatening his life,
but he says nothing can interfere
with his duty."
438,MURPHY,438,"And to prove to the voters that the
Red Menace is on the level, the
Sheriff has written himself four
more letters, threatening his life.
I know he wrote 'em on account of
the misspellings."
439,ENDICOTT,439,"Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows
up the Sheriff will still be crying
'Wolf!'"
440,MURPHY,440,"What have you got, Hildy?"
441,HILDY,441,Kings and sixes.
442,MURPHY,442,That's good.
443,HILDY,443,"'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'...
Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's
knee."
444,WILSON,444,"That's why I keep losing. My grandma
was a modest woman -- nobody ever
saw her knees, not even my grandpop."
445,BRUCE,445,"I don't know. This makes me feel
funny."
446,BURNS,446,"Why shouldn't I make Hildy my
beneficiary? I've got nobody else to
leave it to."
447,BRUCE,447,I feel I ought to take care of her.
448,BURNS,448,"Well, you'll take care of her. After
all, if that doctor's right, I'm
going to live for a long time yet.
Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor.
I was a very bad husband: Hildy could
have got a lot of alimony if she'd
wanted to, but she wouldn't take
any. She had it coming to her, but
she was too independent."
449,BRUCE,449,"Well, I'm independent, too."
450,BURNS,450,"Figure it this way: I ought to be
good for twenty-five years. By that
time, you'll probably have made enough
so that the money won't mean anything.
But suppose you haven't made good --
don't you think Hildy's entitled to
a quiet old age without any worries?"
451,BRUCE,451,"Well, of course, if you put it that
way."
452,BURNS,452,"And remember this, Bruce! I love
her, too."
453,BRUCE,453,I'm beginning to realize that.
454,BURNS,454,"And the beauty of it is she'll never
have to know 'till I've passed on.
Maybe she'll think kindly of me ---
after I'm gone."
455,BRUCE,455,"Gee, you almost make me feel like a
heel -- coming between you."
456,BURNS,456,"No, Bruce, you didn't come between
us. It was all over for her before
you came on the scene. For me --
it'll never be over."
457,DUFFY,457,"Here's that certified check, Walter."
458,DUFFY,458,"I drew out my wife's savings, and if
this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined
man!"
459,BURNS,459,"Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it
back by five."
460,BURNS,460,"Thanks, Duffy. Stick around."
461,BURNS,461,"Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified
and everything."
462,BRUCE,462,"Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel
ashamed to think she hadn't trusted
you."
463,BRUCE,463,"Well, she'll know some day."
464,BURNS,464,"That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute."
465,BURNS,465,"Don't want to forget this, you know.
Might start to rain again."
466,BRUCE,466,"Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away
to get that story."
467,BURNS,467,"Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting
a good man."
468,BRUCE,468,Thanks a lot.
469,BURNS,469,"Well, I got to get back. You can
find your way out, can't you?"
470,BRUCE,470,"Oh, sure."
471,BRUCE,471,"Well, thanks for everything."
472,BURNS,472,"Don't thank me. I should thank you.
So long."
473,BRUCE,473,So long.
474,HILDY,474,"I don't know why you boys are so
good to me."
475,MCCUE,475,"Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy.
Lend me two bucks, will you?"
476,HILDY,476,Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
477,BENSINGER,477,I wish they'd stop that practicing.
478,HILDY,478,"Well, anyhow, I won't be covering
stuff like this any more."
479,SCHWARTZ,479,What's the matter? Getting yellow?
480,MCCUE,480,"For you, Hildy."
481,HILDY,481,"Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce.
Have you got it? Is it certified?"
482,BRUCE,482,"Certified and everything. Got it
right here in my wallet... What? No,
he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth."
483,MCCUE,483,"Certified, eh? Who is it -- your
milkman?"
484,HILDY,484,"But, Bruce, don't keep it in your
wallet!... Well, you see --"
485,HILDY,485,"-- there's an old newspaper
superstition that the first big check
you get you -- you put in the lining
of your hat. That brings you good
luck for ten years."
486,MCCUE,486,"Say, I've been a reporter twenty
years and never heard any hooey like
that. Where'd you get it?"
487,HILDY,487,"I made it up just now, and who's
asking you?"
488,HILDY,488,"I know it's silly, honey, but do it
for me, won't you?... Yes, right
now."
489,BRUCE,489,All right. Wait a minute.
490,BRUCE,490,"All right. I've done it. Now, are
you satisfied?"
491,HILDY,491,Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
492,HILDY,492,"Now, darling, you go back to the
hotel and pack and you and Mother
pick me up here about half-past five.
Goodbye, dear."
493,COOLEY,493,"Hello, Hildy! What are you doing
around here?"
494,HILDY,494,"I want to interview Earl Williams,
Warden. How about a little service?"
495,COOLEY,495,"No more interviews. Besides, a
doctor's coming over."
496,HILDY,496,"Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?"
497,COOLEY,497,I think it is.
498,HILDY,498,"I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry."
499,COP,499,What's going on?
500,LOUIS,500,This guy stole my watch.
501,COP,501,Have you got his watch?
502,BRUCE,502,He's crazy. I haven't any watch.
503,LOUIS,503,"I saw him. He put it in his back
pocket."
504,BRUCE,504,I haven't got --
505,COP,505,Wait a minute.
506,COP,506,Is this yours?
507,LOUIS,507,Yeah! That's it!
508,COP,508,What about it?
509,BRUCE,509,I never saw it before.
510,COP,510,Come on!
511,COP,511,Beat it!
512,BRUCE,512,My hat!
513,COP,513,"Get his hat, somebody."
514,WILLIAMS,514,"I couldn't plead insanity, because
you see I'm just as sane as anybody
else."
515,HILDY,515,"You didn't mean to kill that
policeman?"
516,WILLIAMS,516,"Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody --
it's against everything I've ever
stood for. They know it was an
accident. They're not hanging me for
that -- they're hanging me for my
beliefs."
517,HILDY,517,"What are your beliefs, Earl?"
518,WILLIAMS,518,"They're very simple. I believe in
the Golden Rule. I'm not the first
man to die for preaching it. But if
they would only listen to it -- we
could have a fine, decent world
instead of this mass of hate that
makes man do such cruel things."
519,HILDY,519,"How would you go about applying the
Golden Rule, Earl?"
520,WILLIAMS,520,"I'd do away with the profit system
and have production for use only.
There's enough food and clothing and
shelter for everybody if we'd use
some sense."
521,HILDY,521,"""Production for use only."" Well,
maybe that's the answer."
522,WILLIAMS,522,"It's the only answer. Everything has
a use and if we let it be used for
its purpose, we could solve all our
problems. Food was meant to be eaten,
not stored away in restaurants while
poor people starved; clothing was
meant to be worn, not piled up in
stores while people went naked.
Doesn't that make sense?"
523,HILDY,523,"Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl."
524,WILLIAM'S VOICE,524,"Just use things for what they were
meant, that's all."
525,HILDY,525,Sure.
526,HILDY,526,"What's the purpose of a gun, Earl?"
527,WILLIAMS,527,A gun?
528,WILLIAMS,528,"Why -- to shoot, of course."
529,HILDY,529,"Is that how you came to shoot the
policeman?"
530,WILLIAMS,530,"Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun
in my hand before and I didn't know
what to do with it. Well, when I get
stuck, I know that there's an answer
for everything in production for
use. So it came to me in a flash:
what's a gun for? To shoot! So I
shot. Simple isn't it?"
531,HILDY,531,"Very simple, Earl."
532,WILLIAMS,532,"There's nothing crazy about that, is
there?"
533,HILDY,533,"No, Earl, not at all."
534,HILDY,534,"Who sent you the flowers, Earl?"
535,WILLIAMS,535,"Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful
person."
536,HILDY,536,Isn't that her picture?
537,WILLIAMS,537,Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
538,HILDY'S VOICE,538,"If you should be pardoned, are you
figuring on marrying Mollie?"
539,EARL'S VOICE,539,"Oh, no, she's much too good for me."
540,HARTMAN'S VOICE,540,How'd you get in here?
541,HILDY,541,Same way you did.
542,HILDY,542,Through that gate.
543,HARTMAN,543,"I gave strict orders that nobody was
to interview Williams without my
permission."
544,HILDY,544,"All right, then, I'll just run the
story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid
to let reporters interview his
prisoner. Of course, with election
coming, that might do you a lot of
harm, but just as you say."
545,HARTMAN,545,"Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid
of anything. What were you going to
write about Williams?"
546,HILDY,546,"Oh, nothing much. Just that the state
had proved he was sane -- and he
admits it himself. If you don't want
me to run it --"
547,HARTMAN,547,"Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go
ahead, run it. And you can say I
treated him well, too."
548,HARTMAN,548,"'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?"
549,WILLIAMS,549,"Fine, thanks, Sheriff."
550,HARTMAN,550,"That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got
another alienist to see you. He ought
to be here any minute. Don't go to
sleep, will you?"
551,WILLIAMS,551,I won't.
552,HARTMAN,552,"Hildy, how'd you like a couple of
tickets for the hanging?"
553,HILDY,553,"No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town
tonight."
554,HARTMAN,554,"You ought to stay over. You always
wrote a good hanging story, Hildy."
555,HILDY,555,"That's awful kind of you, Sheriff.
I've got to get started on my
interview. See you later."
556,WILLIAMS,556,"Don't forget about production for
use."
557,HILDY,557,"I won't, Earl."
558,MURPHY,558,"Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't
around."
559,ENDICOTT,559,Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
560,WILSON,560,Baldwin -- his name is.
561,SCHWARTZ,561,I give that marriage six months.
562,MCCUE,562,Why?
563,SCHWARTZ,563,"Hildy won't be able to stay away
from a paper any longer than that.
Did you see her eyes light up when
she came in here? Like an old fire
horse."
564,MURPHY,564,She says she's gonna write fiction.
565,ENDICOTT,565,"Well, if she's gonna write fiction,
there's nothing like being a reporter."
566,SCHWARTZ,566,"I'll give ten to five that marriage
won't last six months. Hildy's a
newspaper man. She's got headlines
in her veins -- the way we all have
or we'd be out of these lousy jobs."
567,MCCUE,567,"Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy."
568,MURPHY,568,"Hello, Mollie."
569,WILSON,569,"How's tricks, Mollie?"
570,MOLLIE,570,I've been lookin' for you tramps.
571,ENDICOTT,571,"Kid, those were pretty roses you
sent Earl. What do you want done
with them tomorrow morning?"
572,MOLLIE,572,"A lot of wise guys, ain't you?"
573,SCHWARTZ,573,"You're breaking up the game, Mollie.
What do you want?"
574,MOLLIE,574,"I want to tell you what I think of
you -- all of you."
575,MURPHY,575,Keep your shirt on.
576,MOLLIE,576,"If you was worth breaking my fingers
on, I'd tear your face wide open."
577,MURPHY,577,"What are you sore about, sweetheart?
Wasn't that a swell story we gave
you?"
578,MOLLIE,578,"You crumbs have been making a fool
out of me long enough!"
579,BENSINGER,579,She oughtn't be allowed in here!
580,MOLLIE,580,"I never said I loved Earl Williams
and was willing to marry him on the
gallows! You made that up! And about
my being his soul-mate and having a
love-nest with him."
581,ENDICOTT,581,"You've been sucking around that cuckoo
ever since he's been in the death-
house. Everybody knows you're his
sweetheart."
582,MOLLIE,582,"That's a lie! I met Mr. Williams
just once in my life when he was
wandering around in the rain without
his hat and coat on, like a sick
dog, the day before the shooting. I
went up to him like any human being
would and I asked him what was the
matter, and he told me about being
fired after working at the same place
for fourteen years, and I brought
him up to my room because it was
warm there."
583,MURPHY'S VOICE,583,"Aw, put it on a phonograph!"
584,MOLLIE,584,"Just because you want to fill your
lying paper with a lot of dirty
scandal, you got to crucify him and
make a stooge out of me!"
585,ENDICOTT,585,Got a match?
586,MOLLIE,586,"I tell you he just sat there talking
to me -- all night. And never once
laid a hand on me. In the morning he
went away, and I never saw him again
till that day at the trial!"
587,MOLLIE,587,"Go on, laugh! I'd like to know some
curses bad enough for your greasy
souls! Sure, I was his witness --
the only one he had. Yes -- me --
cheap little Mollie Malloy! I'm
everything the District Attorney
said I was. And still I was the only
one with guts enough to stand up for
him! I told the truth and the District
Attorney knows it! That's why you're
persecutin' me! Because Earl Williams
treated me decent and not like an
animal -- and I said so!"
588,MURPHY,588,"Go into your dance! This is the Press
Room. We're busy."
589,WILSON,589,"Why don't you go and see your boy-
friend?"
590,ENDICOTT,590,"But you'll have to hurry up -- he
left a call for seven A.M."
591,MOLLIE,591,"It's a wonder a bolt of lightning
don't come down and strike you all
dead!"
592,ENDICOTT,592,"Don't get hysterical, kid."
593,MOLLIE,593,Shame on you!
594,MOLLIE,594,"A poor little fellow that never meant
nobody no harm! Sitting there alone
this minute with the Angel of Death
beside him, and you cracking jokes!"
595,MURPHY'S VOICE,595,"If you don't shut up, we'll give you
something to cry about!"
596,HILDY,596,"Come on, Mollie. This is no place
for you."
597,MOLLIE,597,They're not human!
598,HILDY,598,"They're newspaper men, Mollie. They
can't help themselves. The Lord made
them that way."
599,MOLLIE,599,It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
600,MURPHY,600,You guys wanna play some more poker?
601,ENDICOTT,601,What's the use? I can't win a pot.
602,WILSON,602,"Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped
out. She'll be back in a second.
Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll
hang on a minute, she ought to be
right in. All right."
603,WILSON,603,"Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom --
himself."
604,SCHWARTZ,604,What's he want?
605,WILSON,605,"Wants Hildy -- and sounds very
excited."
606,HILDY,606,"Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking
on somebody who can't defend himself --
the littler the better."
607,WILSON,607,"Phone for you, Hildy."
608,HILDY,608,Who is it?
609,WILSON,609,"Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?"
610,HILDY,610,Give me that!
611,HILDY,611,"Hello! Hello! Bruce?... what?...
Where are you?... You're where?...
How did that happen?..."
612,HILDY,612,I'll be right over!
613,MURPHY,613,"Boy, did you see her go?"
614,ENDICOTT,614,Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
615,WILSON,615,I told you Baldwin was in trouble.
616,MCCUE,616,"Probably went out without his hankie
and wants Mamma to wipe his nose."
617,SCHWARTZ,617,I still give that marriage six months.
618,BENSINGER,618,"Hello, baby, get me the Sheriff's
offico, will you... Hello, Sheriff
Hartman?... This is Bensinger. How
about that favor? You know what:
once and for all, will you hang this
guy at five A.M. instead of seven?
It won't hurt you and we can make
the City Edition."
619,HARTMAN,619,"Once and for all, I'm not going to
hang anybody except at the legal
hour... What? Don't threaten me,
Bensinger! I'm not afraid of any
newspapers. Yeah?... Oh, shut up!"
620,HARTMAN,620,"And, operator, I told you not to
disturb me! I don't care who calls --
I don't want to be disturbed again
till I tell you!"
621,HARTMAN,621,"How do you like that, Dr. Egelhoffer?
Want me to hang williams at their
convenience!"
622,EGELHOFFER,622,"The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the
scum of modern civilization."
623,HARTMAN,623,You said it!
624,EGELHOFFER,624,"They're always after me for
interviews."
625,HARTMAN,625,"Me, too."
626,EGELHOFFER,626,"Of course, I sort of promised them I
would give out a statement when I
got through here. You don't mind?"
627,HARTMAN,627,"Well, I don't know if that's ethical.
You see, all statements are supposed
to come from me."
628,EGELHOFFER,628,"We'll have to satisfy them. What
would you say to giving them a joint
interview? I could give them some of
the psychological aspects of the
case and you could give them the
legal aspects."
629,HARTMAN,629,"A joint interview, eh? That might be
all right. We could have our pictures
taken together, Doctor."
630,EGELHOFFER,630,"Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a
very good picture, though."
631,HARTMAN,631,"It doesn't matter. The publicity's
the main thing."
632,EGELHOFFER,632,"Yes, I suppose so. It all helps."
633,WILLIAMS,633,"Are you gentlemen all through with
me?"
634,EGELHOFFER,634,"Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were
here. No, Mr. Williams, we still
have some questions for you. Sheriff,
will you kindly extinguish the lights?"
635,EGELHOFFER,635,"You know you are to be executed, Mr.
Williams. Who do you feel is
responsible for that?"
636,WILLIAMS,636,"The system. But I'm not afraid to
die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I
believe."
637,EGELHOFFER,637,"I see. You realize, however, that
you committed a crime?"
638,WILLIAMS,638,"In a legal sense, yes. But not
actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I
didn't do anything."
639,BRUCE,639,"I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
I never stole a watch in my life."
640,HILDY,640,"I know you didn't, Bruce."
641,HILDY,641,"Let him out of here, Lieutenant."
642,LIEUTENANT,642,"But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of
stealing a watch. And they found the
watch on him."
643,HILDY,643,"And who accused him? Diamond Louis!
One of the worst crooks in town! Why
don't you arrest Louis instead of
innocent people that he frames?"
644,LIEUTENANT,644,"Now, Hildy --"
645,HILDY,645,"Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let
him out?"
646,LIEUTENANT,646,I can't.
647,HILDY,647,"All right. You can't. But tomorrow
the Post will run the story of that
roulette game on 43rd Street that
your brother-in-law runs. And we'll
print that you get five hundred a
month for forgetting about it!"
648,LIEUTENANT,648,"Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't
let him out."
649,HILDY,649,"You can let him out on bail, can't
you?"
650,LIEUTENANT,650,Five hundred dollars.
651,HILDY,651,You'll take fifty and like it!
652,LIEUTENANT,652,"Well, all right. But I'm liable to
get into a jam."
653,HILDY,653,"You'll get into a worse one if you
don't."
654,HILDY,654,What's the matter?
655,BRUCE,655,I lost my wallet.
656,HILDY,656,"The check, Bruce!"
657,BRUCE,657,"That's right here. Gee, it was lucky
your telling me about that old
newspaper superstition."
658,HILDY,658,"Yes, wasn't it?"
659,BRUCE,659,"I can't imagine who did it. I can't
think of any enemies I have."
660,HILDY,660,I'm sure you haven't any.
661,BRUCE,661,"For a minute, I thought maybe Walter
Burns was at the back of it. But
then I realized he couldn't have
been."
662,HILDY,662,"Oh, no. How could you ever think of
such a thing?"
663,BRUCE,663,"Oh, I realized right away. He's really
a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found
that out."
664,HILDY,664,"Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're
taking that next train -- and when I
say next train, this time I mean it!"
665,BRUCE,665,Did you finish the interview?
666,HILDY,666,The Criminal Courts Building.
667,HILDY,667,"No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right
with Walter."
668,BRUCE,668,"But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that
insurance business -- and you promised --"
669,HILDY,669,"Well, the story's practically
finished. I'll just go upstairs and
send it over with a messenger."
670,HILDY,670,"No, you stay here. I'm not taking
any more chances. I'll be down in
three minutes -- and don't you dare
move!"
671,SCHWARTZ,671,"""But the State has a production for
use plan, too. It has a gallows and
at seven A.M., unless a miracle
occurs, that gallows will be used to
separate the soul of Earl Williams
from his body. And out of Molly
Malloy's life will go the one kindly
soul she ever knew --"""
672,SCHWARTZ,672,"That's as far as Hildy got. But, I
ask you, can that girl write an
interview?"
673,BENSINGER,673,"I don't think it's very ethical
reading other people's stuff."
674,ENDICOTT,674,"Don't give us that ethics stuff.
You'll be the only one who'll swipe
any of it."
675,SCHWARTZ,675,"I still say anybody that writes like
that ain't going to give it up
permanently to sew sox for a guy in
the insurance business. Now I give
that marriage three months and I'm
laying three to one. Any takers?"
676,HILDY'S VOICE,676,I'll take that bet.
677,HILDY,677,"It's getting so a girl can't step
out of the room without being
discussed by a bunch of old ladies."
678,HILDY,678,"Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns,
please."
679,SCHWARTZ,679,"Well, Hildy, we were only saying
that a swell reporter like you
wouldn't give this up so easily."
680,HILDY,680,This is Hildy Johnson...
681,HILDY,681,"Oh, I can give it up all right.
Without a single quiver. I'm going
to live like a human being -- not
like you rats."
682,HILDY,682,"Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I
didn't mean ""dear."" That was just
habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself,
Walter. I've got some news for you...
Yes, I got the interview, but I've
got some news that's more important."
683,HILDY,683,"Better get a pencil out and write it
down. All ready?"
684,HILDY,684,"Get this, you double-crossing
chimpanzee, there ain't gonna be any
interview and there ain't gonna be
any story... Huh? That certified
check of yours is leaving with me in
twenty minutes. And if I ever see
you again, it's going to be just too
bad... Eh?... Oh, you don't know
what I'm angry about, do you? If you
come over I'll be very glad to tell
you the story of Louie's watch. I
dare you to come over, you -- you --
skunk in sheep's clothing! And bring
that bodyguard of yours, too -- you'll
need him."
685,HILDY,685,"...And I just want you to listen to
one more thing."
686,HILDY,686,"Hear that? That's the interview I
wrote... Yes, I know we made a
bargain. I just said I'd write it --
I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up.
Yes, it's all in little pieces now,
Walter, and I hope to do the same
for you some time!"
687,HILDY,687,"And that's my farewell to the
newspaper game. I'm going to live a
normal life and have a home."
688,HILDY,688,"I'm going to be a woman, not a
newsgetting machine. I'm going to
have babies and nurse them and love
them and give 'em cod liver oil and
worry about their new teeth -- and
the minute I catch one of them even
looking at a newspaper, I'm going to
brain him! Where's my hat?"
689,SCHWARTZ,689,"Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still
here."
690,HILDY,690,I'll take it.
691,HILDY,691,"What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't
you understand English? -- Why, your
language is shocking, Mr. Burns --
positively shocking! I don't mind
because I was married to you and
know what to expect, but suppose
Central is listening in... Oh, did
you hear that, Central? We ought to
report him, don't you think?... Oh,
fooey on you!"
692,HILDY,692,"Now where was that hat? Oh, yes."
693,WILLIAMS,693,"I hope you're pretty nearly through
with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little
fatigued."
694,HARTMAN,694,"Yeah, you don't want to tire him
out, Doctor."
695,EGELHOFFER,695,"Just one thing more. I'd like to
reenact the crime, Mr. Williams. May
I have your gun, please, Sheriff?"
696,HARTMAN,696,I don't know --
697,EGELHOFFER,697,"Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't
strike in the same place twice.
Nothing's going to happen."
698,EGELHOFFER,698,"Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie
Malloy, in whose room you were. You
will be Earl Williams. And I will be
the policeman. Follow me, Mr.
Williams?"
699,WILLIAMS,699,"Yes, sir."
700,EGELHOFFER,700,"So -- now I say to you: 'Earl
Williams, you are under arrest!' and
you point your gun at me."
701,WILLIAMS,701,"Well, it wasn't exactly that way --"
702,EGELHOFFER,702,Point the gun at me!
703,EGELHOFFER,703,Then what did you do?
704,WILLIAMS,704,"Now can I go, please?"
705,VOICE,705,"Hey, Sheriff! Open up! What happened?"
706,ENDICOTT,706,"Goodbye, Yonson."
707,MCCUE,707,"So long, Hildy."
708,MURPHY,708,"Send us a postcard, kid."
709,SCHWARTZ,709,"Who'll keep the lamp in the window
for you."
710,BENSINGER,710,"Goodbye, Hildy."
711,HILDY,711,"Well, goodbye, you wage-slaves. When
you're crawling up fire escapes,
getting kicked out of front doors,
and eating Christmas dinners in one-
armed joints, don't forget your pal,
Hildy Johnson! And, remember, my
husband sells insurance!"
712,HILDY,712,"""It takes a heap o' livin' to make a
house a home."""
713,VOICES FROM COURTYARD,713,"Get the riot guns! Spread out, you
fellows! Etc."
714,WILSON,714,There's a jail-break!
715,MURPHY,715,"Cooley! What's the matter What's
happened?"
716,VOICES FROM YARD,716,"Watch the gate! He's probably trying
the gate!"
717,ENDICOTT,717,Who got away? Who was it?
718,VOICE OUTSIDE,718,Earl... Williams!!!
719,THE REPORTERS,719,"Who? Who'd he say? Earl Williams! It
was Earl Williams! He got away! Etc."
720,MCCUE,720,Holy ---! Gimme that telephone!
721,MCCUE,721,Hurry! Hurry up! This is important!
722,MCCUE,722,Look out!
723,MURPHY,723,"Look out where you're aiming, will
you?"
724,HILDY,724,Ahhh --
725,HILDY,725,"Morning Post?... Get me Walter Burns --
quick! Hildy Johnson calling."
726,HILDY,726,"Walter?... Hildy. Earl Williams just
escaped from the County Jail. Yep...
yep... yep... don't worry! I'm on
the job!"
727,HILDY,727,"Cooley, I want to talk to you."
728,COOLEY,728,"Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I --
Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has
escaped --"
729,HILDY,729,"There's money in it, Cooley."
730,COOLEY,730,"I can't Hildy. It means my job! It
means --"
731,HILDY,731,A lot of money.
732,HILDY,732,Four hundred and fifty dollars --
733,COOLEY,733,How much?
734,HILDY,734,"Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is
it a deal?"
735,COOLEY,735,It's a deal. Let me up.
736,COOLEY,736,Let's see the money.
737,HILDY,737,"First we talk. How did Earl Williams
get that gun?"
738,COOLEY,738,"Come on, and I'll tell you."
739,ENDICOTT,739,Endicott talking.
740,ENDICOTT,740,"No -- nobody knows where he got the
gun, but I think Mollie Malloy
smuggled it in to him. He ran up the
fire-escape, and went back in the
infirmary window. Then he got out
through the skylight. He must have
slid down the rain-pipe to the street."
741,MURPHY'S VOICE,741,Gimme the Desk.
742,ENDICOTT,742,"No, I tell you! Nobody knows where
he got it."
743,MURPHY,743,"The Crime Commission has offered a
reward of ten thousand dollars for
Williams' capture."
744,ENDICOTT,744,Call you back.
745,MURPHY,745,"No clue yet as to Earl Williams'
whereabouts. Here's a little feature
though: There's been an accident
about a tear bomb --"
746,WILSON,746,Wilson talking.
747,MURPHY,747,"Yeah -- tear bomb. Criminals cry for
it."
748,HARTMAN,748,"If the Mayor wants me, he knows where
I am."
749,MURPHY,749,"This tear bomb went off unexpectedly
in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's
Bombing Squad."
750,HARTMAN,750,What went off?
751,MURPHY,751,"Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs
were rushed to the hospital --"
752,HARTMAN,752,A fine fair-weather friend you are!
753,MURPHY,753,"The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who
is the Mayor's brother-in-law --"
754,HARTMAN,754,After all I've done for you --
755,MURPHY,755,"Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle
on his mother's side --"
756,WILSON,756,"Hello, Jim? Sidelights on Sheriff
Hartman's manhunt."
757,MURPHY,757,"William Lungren, who is the Sheriff's
landlord, and Lester Bartow who
married the Sheriff's niece. You
remember, the very homely dame. Call
you back."
758,WILSON,758,"Mrs. William Tausig, age fifty-five,
scrub lady, while at work scrubbing
the eighth floor of the Commerce
Building, was shot in the left leg
by one of Sheriff Hartman's deputies."
759,HILDY,759,There goes another scrub lady.
760,WILSON,760,I'll go right after it.
761,MURPHY,761,Any dope yet on how he got out?
762,HILDY,762,"From all I can get the Sheriff let
him out so's he could vote for him."
763,HARTMAN,763,"I'm very disappointed in you, Hildy
Johnson."
764,MURPHY,764,"How do you suppose Williams got that
gun?"
765,HILDY,765,Give me Walter Burns -- quick --
766,HILDY,766,"Walter, listen. I've got the inside
story on how Williams got the gun
and escaped."
767,BURNS,767,Exclusive? That's great.
768,HILDY,768,"It cost me four hundred and fifty
bucks to tear it out of Cooley."
769,BURNS,769,Never mind that. What's the story?
770,HILDY,770,"Never mind it? That's not my money!
That's Bruce's money!"
771,BURNS,771,You'll get it. Now what's the story?
772,BURNS,772,"I'll have the paper send the money
right down to you. I swear it on my
mother's grave."
773,HILDY,773,Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
774,BURNS,774,"I meant on my grandmother's grave.
Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's
the story?!"
775,HILDY,775,"Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer,
from New York, decides to make
Williams re-enact the crime --"
776,HILDY,776,"Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the
Professor had to have a gun to re-
enact the crime with -- and who do
you suppose supplied it? Nobody else
but that great thinker, Sheriff
Hartman!"
777,BURNS,777,"No kidding, Hildy."
778,BURNS,778,"Say, this isn't a rib?"
779,HILDY,779,"No, this is on the level, Walter.
I'm not good enough to make this one
up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the
Professor, the Professor gave it to
Earl, and Earl gave it right back to
the Professor -- right in the stomach!
Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly.
They took him to the County Hospital
where they're afraid he'll recover."
780,BURNS,780,"That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh,
will you stop worrying about the
money? I'll see you get it in fifteen
minutes."
781,HILDY,781,"It better be fifteen minutes, because
Bruce is waiting downstairs in a
taxicab and that meter's clicking
away to beat the band."
782,BURNS,782,Hold on a minute.
783,BURNS,783,"Come here. There's a guy waiting in
a taxi in front of the Criminal Courts
building. His name is Bruce Baldwin.
Can you do your stuff?"
784,BLONDE,784,"I've never flopped on you, have I?"
785,BURNS,785,"Then scram! You've got about two
minutes."
786,BURNS,786,"Sorry to keep you waiting. How much
was it again? Four hundred and fifty
dollars? Hang on a second."
787,BURNS,787,"I need four hundred and fifty dollars
in counterfeit money. You know where
I can get it?"
788,LOUIS,788,"It's awful funny -- I happen to have
some on me."
789,BURNS,789,"It's coming right over. I'm sending
it over with Louis. Thanks for the
story and good luck on your honeymoon."
790,HILDY,790,"Keep the thanks, but just see that
the money gets here!"
791,MCCUE,791,"Hello, Hildy. I thought you were
gone."
792,HILDY,792,"I thought so, too."
793,MCCUE,793,"McCue speaking. Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe,
eight-sixty-one and a half South
State Street, colored, gave birth to
a pickaninny in a patrol wagon with
Sheriff Hartman's special Rifle Squad
acting as nurses. Well -- Phoebe was
walking along the street when all of
a sudden she began -- that's right.
So the police coaxed her into the
patrol wagon and they started a race
with the stork. When the pickaninny
was born the Rifle Squad examined
him carefully to see if it was Earl
Williams who they knew was hiding
somewhere."
794,MCCUE,794,"Did you get that, Hildy?"
795,HILDY,795,No -- what?
796,HILDY,796,"Hello -- Bruce! I thought you were
downstairs in a -- What? Arrested
again! What for this time, Bruce?
Mashing! Oh, Bruce, can't I leave
you alone for three minutes even?
Well, where are you? The 27th
Precinct? All right, I'll be right
over --"
797,HILDY,797,"I'll be over in twenty minutes, Bruce."
798,HILDY,798,If I ever see Walter Burns --
799,HILDY,799,"Get me Walter Burns... Hildy Johnson!
Well, he was there just a minute
ago! Have him call me back!"
800,HILDY,800,"If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire
for me, will you? I'll be right back."
801,MCCUE,801,"Okay, Hildy."
802,MCCUE,802,"Well, we can't get any official
statement --"
803,MCCUE,803,"Oh, wait a minute -- here's the Mayor.
Maybe he'll give us one."
804,MAYOR,804,"Don't pester me now, please. I got a
lot on my mind."
805,MCCUE,805,His Honor won't say anything.
806,MAYOR,806,Have you seen Sheriff Hartman?
807,MCCUE,807,"It's hard to say, Your Honor. The
place is so full of cockroaches."
808,MURPHY,808,"Say, Your Honor, what effect's this
jail-break going to have on the
colored voters?"
809,MAYOR,809,"Not an iota. In what way can an
unavoidable misfortune of this sort
influence the duty of every citizen,
colored or otherwise?"
810,ENDICOTT,810,"Your Honor, is there a Red Menace or
ain't there?"
811,MAYOR,811,"Hartman, I've been looking for you!"
812,MURPHY,812,So have we!
813,ENDICOTT,813,"What's the dope, Sheriff?"
814,MURPHY,814,Who engineered this getaway?
815,HARTMAN,815,Just a minute! We've got him located.
816,ENDICOTT,816,Williams?
817,MURPHY,817,Where is he?
818,HARTMAN,818,"Where he used to live. You can catch
the Riot Squad -- it's just going
out."
819,MAYOR,819,"Pete, I want to talk to you!"
820,HARTMAN,820,"I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll
see you after."
821,MAYOR,821,"Did you actually give Williams that
gun?"
822,HARTMAN,822,"The professor asked me for it -- I
thought it was for something
scientific!"
823,MAYOR,823,"Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant
task to perf --"
824,SCHWARTZ,824,"Hiya, Your Honor."
825,SCHWARTZ,825,Schwartz calling.
826,SCHWARTZ,826,"How about it, Your Honor? Any
statement on the Red uprising
tomorrow?"
827,MAYOR,827,What Red uprising?
828,HARTMAN,828,There'll be no Red uprising!
829,SCHWARTZ,829,Gimme rewrite --
830,SCHWARTZ,830,"The Governor says the situation calls
for the militia."
831,MAYOR,831,"You can quote me as saying that
anything the Governor says is a tissue
of lies."
832,SCHWARTZ,832,"Hello, Jake. Here's a red-hot
statement from the Governor. He claims
that the Mayor and the Sheriff have
shown themselves to be a couple of
eight-year-olds playing with fire."
833,SCHWARTZ' VOICE,833,"Quote him as follows: ""It is a lucky
thing for the city that next Tuesday
is Election Day, as the citizens
will thus be saved the expense of
impeaching the Mayor and the Sheriff.""
That's all -- call you back."
834,SCHWARTZ,834,"Nice to have seen you, Mayor."
835,MAYOR,835,"We've got to go somewhere private,
Pete. I've got to talk to you straight
from the shoulder."
836,HARTMAN,836,"Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a
few hours before you make any
decisions. I'll get results. I'm
doing everything humanly possible.
I've just sworn in four hundred
deputies."
837,MAYOR,837,"Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt
this administration?"
838,HARTMAN,838,"I'm getting them for twelve dollars
a night."
839,MAYOR,839,"Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic
uncles of yours?"
840,MAYOR,840,"Out shooting everybody they see for
the fun of it?"
841,HARTMAN,841,"If you're talking about my brother-
in-law, he's worked for the city
fifteen years."
842,MAYOR,842,"Pete, you're through!"
843,HARTMAN,843,What do you mean -- through?
844,MAYOR,844,"I mean I'm scratching your name off
the ticket Tuesday and running
Czernecki in your place. It's nothing
personal. And, Pete -- it's the only
way out. It's a sacrifice we all
ought to be glad to make."
845,HARTMAN,845,Fred!
846,MAYOR,846,"Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my
Sentimental side."
847,HARTMAN,847,"Fred, I don't know what to say. A
thing like this almost destroys a
man's faith in human nature."
848,MAYOR,848,"I wish you wouldn't talk like that,
Pete."
849,HARTMAN,849,"Our families, Fred. I've always looked
on Bessie as my own sister."
850,MAYOR,850,If there was any way out...
851,HARTMAN,851,"There is a way out. I've got Williams
surrounded, haven't I? What more do
you want?"
852,HARTMAN,852,Hello... Yes... Hello!
853,HARTMAN,853,"Four hundred suppers! Nothing doing!
This is a man-hunt -- not a
banquet!... The twelve dollars
includes everything!!"
854,HARTMAN,854,"That gives you an idea of what I'm
up against!"
855,MAYOR,855,"We're up against a lot more than
that with that nutty slogan you
invented: 'Reform the Reds With a
Rope'."
856,MAYOR,856,"Williams ain't a Red, and you know
it!"
857,HARTMAN,857,"Well, there's a lot of Communistic
sympathizers around --"
858,MAYOR,858,"I know it! But they've got nothing
to do with this case! Do you realize
there are two hundred thousand votes
at stake and unless we hang Earl
Williams we're going to lose 'em?"
859,HARTMAN,859,"But we're going to hang him, Fred.
He can't get away."
860,MAYOR,860,"What do you mean he can't get away?!
He got away, didn't he?"
861,MAYOR,861,Who's out there?
862,VOICE OUTSIDE (PINKUS),862,Is Sheriff Hartman in there?
863,HARTMAN,863,Ah! For me!
864,HARTMAN,864,I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
865,PINKUS,865,"You're certainly a hard fellow to
find, Sheriff."
866,MAYOR,866,What do you want?
867,PINKUS,867,"I'm a messenger at the State House.
This is from the Governor."
868,MAYOR,868,What's from the Governor?
869,PINKUS,869,The reprieve for Earl Williams.
870,HARTMAN,870,For who?
871,PINKUS,871,Earl Williams. The reprieve.
872,MAYOR,872,W-wait a minute.
873,HARTMAN,873,"The Governor gave me his word of
honor he wouldn't interfere. Two
days ago!"
874,MAYOR,874,"And you fell for it, Pete. It
frightens me what I'd like to do to
you."
875,MAYOR,875,Who else knows about this?
876,PINKUS,876,"They were all standing around when
he wrote it. It was after they got
back from fishing."
877,MAYOR,877,Get the Governor on the phone!
878,PINKUS,878,"You can't get him on the phone. He's
out duckshooting now."
879,MAYOR,879,"Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you
like that. A guy does nothing more
strenuous for forty years than play
pinochle -- he gets elected Governor
and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!"
880,HARTMAN,880,"Read it! Insane, he says."
881,HARTMAN,881,"He knows very well that Williams
ain't insane!"
882,PINKUS,882,Yeah. But I --
883,MAYOR,883,Pure politics!
884,HARTMAN,884,An attempt to ruin us!
885,MAYOR,885,Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
886,HARTMAN,886,"We got to think fast before those
lying reporters get hold of this.
What'll we tell 'em?"
887,MAYOR,887,"Tell 'em the party is through in
this State on account of you."
888,HARTMAN,888,"Ah, Fred --"
889,HARTMAN,889,Hello... this is Hartman --
890,MAYOR,890,"And you can tell 'em as an
afterthought that I want your
resignation now!"
891,HARTMAN,891,"Sssh. Wait, Fred."
892,HARTMAN,892,What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
893,MAYOR,893,What is it?
894,HARTMAN,894,They got him!
895,HARTMAN,895,Wait a minute -- hold the wire.
896,HARTMAN,896,"They got Earl Williams surrounded --
the Riot Squad has -- in his house."
897,MAYOR,897,Tell 'em to hold the wire.
898,HARTMAN,898,I did.
899,HARTMAN,899,Hold the wire.
900,MAYOR,900,Cover up that transmitter!
901,MAYOR,901,"Now, listen! You never arrived here
with this -- reprieve. Get it?"
902,PINKUS,902,"Yes, I did, just now. Don't you
remember?"
903,MAYOR,903,How much do you make a week?
904,PINKUS,904,Huh?
905,MAYOR,905,"How much do you make a week? What's
your salary?"
906,PINKUS,906,Forty dollars.
907,HARTMAN,907,No -- don't out me off.
908,MAYOR,908,"How would you like to have a job for
three hundred and fifty dollars a
month. That's almost a hundred dollars
a week!"
909,PINKUS,909,Who? Me?
910,MAYOR,910,Who do you think!
911,MAYOR,911,"Now, listen. There's a fine opening
for a fellow like you in the City
Sealer's office."
912,PINKUS,912,The what?
913,MAYOR,913,The City Sealer's office!
914,PINKUS,914,You mean here in the city?
915,MAYOR,915,"Yes, yes!"
916,HARTMAN,916,"Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm
in conference."
917,PINKUS,917,"No, I couldn't do that."
918,MAYOR,918,Why not?
919,PINKUS,919,"I couldn't work in the city. You
see, I've got my family in the
country."
920,MAYOR,920,"But you could bring 'em in here!
We'll pay all your expenses."
921,PINKUS,921,"No, I don't think so."
922,MAYOR,922,"For heaven's sake, why not?"
923,PINKUS,923,"I got two kids going to school there,
and if I changed them from one town
to another, they'd lose a grade."
924,MAYOR,924,"No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain
one! And I guarantee that they'll
graduate with highest honors!"
925,PINKUS,925,Yeah?
926,HARTMAN,926,"Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen?
Hurry up, Fred!"
927,MAYOR,927,Now what do you say?
928,PINKUS,928,This puts me in a peculiar hole.
929,MAYOR,929,"No, it doesn't."
930,MAYOR,930,"Now, remember: you never delivered
this."
931,MAYOR,931,"You got caught in the traffic, or
something."
932,MAYOR,932,"Now, get out of here and don't let
anybody see you."
933,PINKUS,933,But how do I know...?
934,MAYOR,934,"Come in and see me in my office
tomorrow. What's your name?"
935,PINKUS,935,Pinkus.
936,MAYOR,936,"All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've
got to do is lay low and keep your
mouth shut. Here!"
937,MAYOR,937,"Go to this address. It's a nice,
homey little place, and they'll take
care of you for the night. Just tell
'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty
dollars on account."
938,HARTMAN,938,"Will you wait, Olsen? I'll tell you
in a minute!"
939,PINKUS,939,"You forgot to tell me what a City
Sealer has to do."
940,MAYOR,940,I'll explain it tomorrow!
941,PINKUS,941,Is it hard?
942,MAYOR,942,No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
943,HARTMAN,943,Just one second --
944,PINKUS,944,"That's good, because my health ain't
what it used to be."
945,MAYOR,945,"We'll fix that, too."
946,HARTMAN,946,Just -- one -- second!
947,MAYOR,947,All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
948,HARTMAN,948,What?
949,MAYOR,949,"Shoot to kill, I said."
950,HARTMAN,950,"I don't know, Fred. There's that
reprieve if they ever find out."
951,MAYOR,951,"Nobody reprieved that policeman he
murdered. Now, do as I tell you."
952,HARTMAN,952,"Hello, Olsen... Listen..."
953,HARTMAN,953,"Shoot to kill... That's the orders
pass the word along... No! We dont
want him! And listen, Olsen, five-
hundred bucks for the guy that does
the job... Yes, I'll be right out
there."
954,HARTMAN,954,"Well, I hope that's the right thing
to do."
955,MAYOR,955,"Now take that guilty look off your
face, Pete -- and stop trembling
like a horse."
956,HARTMAN,956,"If we didn't have election Tuesday
I'd have this on my conscience."
957,HILDY,957,Will you try --
958,LOUIE'S VOICE,958,Hildy.
959,HILDY,959,Louie!
960,HILDY,960,Have you got my dough?
961,LOUIS,961,"Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with
it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?"
962,HILDY,962,"Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut
your throat if you try any tricks!"
963,LOUIS,963,"All right, all right. You can't blame
a guy for tryin', can you?"
964,HILDY,964,Come on with that money!
965,LOUIS,965,First you got to sign a receipt.
966,HILDY,966,Where's the money?
967,LOUIS,967,"Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right
here."
968,LOUIS,968,"One hundred -- two hundred -- three
hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty.
Now sign."
969,HILDY,969,Here!
970,LOUIS,970,"Thanks. So long, Hildy!"
971,HILDY,971,"So long, nothing! Where's Bruce
Baldwin's wallet?"
972,LOUIS,972,Huh?
973,HILDY,973,"None of that innocent stuff, you
double-crossing hyena! You stuck
Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon
on a phony charge that he swiped
your watch, and you frisked his
wallet! Now, give me that wallet or
I'll stick you in jail and it won't
be on any phony charge either! It'll
be for life!"
974,LOUIS,974,"Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't
know what you're talking about --
but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?"
975,HILDY,975,You know it is!
976,LOUIS,976,"I didn't frisk him. He must have
dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't
know whose it was."
977,HILDY,977,"No -- and you don't know that your
cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin
arrested again -- do you?"
978,LOUIS,978,"What -- already? Why, the dame left
only a minute before I did!"
979,HILDY,979,27th Precinct Station House?
980,WILLIAMS,980,Drop that phone --
981,WILLIAMS,981,"You're not going to phone anybody
where I am."
982,HILDY,982,"Put down that gun, Earl."
983,HILDY,983,"You're not going to shoot me, Earl.
I'm your friend, remember? I've got
to write that story about your
""Production for Use""."
984,WILLIAMS,984,"Yes -- that's right. Production for
use."
985,HILDY,985,"Earl, you don't want to hurt your
friends, do you?"
986,WILLIAMS,986,Don't move!
987,WILLIAMS,987,"Maybe you're my friend and maybe
you're not -- but don't come any
nearer. You can't trust anybody in
this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I
could shoot you from here."
988,HILDY,988,"Sure you could, Earl -- but you
wouldn't want to do that, would you?
You wouldn't want to kill anybody."
989,WILLIAMS,989,"No, no, you're right. I don't want
to kill anybody. All I want to do is
be let alone."
990,HILDY,990,"Earl, there's just one thing I ought
to clear up for the interview."
991,WILLIAMS,991,"What's that? Only -- you're getting
too near. I don't trust anybody."
992,HILDY,992,"I don't blame you, Earl."
993,HILDY,993,"If I were in your place I wouldn't
trust anybody, either."
994,WILLIAMS,994,Keep away!
995,WILLIAMS,995,I guess I used all the shells.
996,HILDY,996,"Earl, you must never do that again."
997,WILLIAMS,997,"Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go
through another day like this."
998,HILDY,998,"Well, maybe you think I could!"
999,EARL'S VOICE,999,"I'm not afraid to die. I was tellin'
the fella that when he handed me the
gun."
1000,HILDY,1000,Don't talk too loud.
1001,WILLIAMS,1001,"Wakin' me up in the middle of the
night -- talkin' to me about things
they don't understand. Callin' me a
Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's
got nothin' to do with bombs. It's
the philosophy that guarantees every
man freedom. You see that, don't
you?"
1002,HILDY,1002,"Sure I do, Earl."
1003,WILLIAMS,1003,"I wish they'd take me back and hang
me. I done my best."
1004,HILDY,1004,Hello... Gimme Walter Burns -- quick!
1005,HILDY,1005,"Hello -- hel -- Oh, hello, Bruce...
Oh, Bruce, please -- I know I said
I'd be down in fifteen minutes, but
something terrific's happened! Hang
on, Bruce --"
1006,HILDY,1006,"Walter?... Hildy. Come over here --
right away!... Wait!"
1007,HILDY,1007,"Bruce, just a second, Bruce -- I'll
explain everything."
1008,HILDY,1008,"Walter! Get this: I've got Earl
Williams... Yes! Here in the Press
Room... Honest! On the level. Hurry --
I need you."
1009,HILDY,1009,"Bruce, this is the biggest thing
that ever happened..."
1010,HILDY,1010,"I just captured Earl Williams -- you
know -- the murderer --"
1011,HILDY,1011,"Bruce, I'll be down -- Well, Bruce,
the minute I turn him over to the
paper I'll be right down. Bruce,
don't you -- Bruce, I can't now -- I
can't, don't you realize?"
1012,HILDY,1012,Who's there?
1013,MOLLIE'S VOICE,1013,"It's me, Mollie Malloy! Let me in."
1014,MOLLIE,1014,"Where are they gone? You know where
they are?"
1015,HILDY,1015,"Wait a minute, Mollie."
1016,MOLLIE,1016,"They got him surrounded some place --
gonna shoot him like a dog!"
1017,HILDY,1017,"Mollie, they haven't got him. You
gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to
do something!"
1018,MOLLIE,1018,What do you mean?
1019,MOLLIE,1019,What's that?
1020,HILDY,1020,"Quiet, Mollie!"
1021,MOLLIE,1021,"There's somethin' funny going on
around here."
1022,WILLIAMS,1022,"Hello, Mollie."
1023,HILDY,1023,"Quiet, Mollie, quiet!"
1024,WILLIAMS,1024,"Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing
to cry about."
1025,HILDY,1025,"How'd you get here, Earl?"
1026,WILLIAMS,1026,"Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to
shoot him. You believe me, don't
you, Mollie?"
1027,MOLLIE,1027,Of course I believe you.
1028,WILLIAMS,1028,"I forgot to thank you for those roses.
They were beautiful."
1029,MOLLIE,1029,"That's all right, Mr. Williams..."
1030,MOLLIE,1030,"You're a woman. You got to help us.
You got to get him out of here, some
place where I can take care of him."
1031,HILDY,1031,"Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk.
I'm trying to think of something
before those reporters get back."
1032,WILLIAMS,1032,"Let 'em take me. It's better that
way."
1033,MOLLIE,1033,No -- I'll never let 'em!
1034,MOLLIE,1034,They'll get him! They'll get him!
1035,HILDY,1035,Ssh!
1036,ENDICOTT,1036,Who locked the door?
1037,HILDY,1037,"Just a second, Mike ---"
1038,HILDY,1038,"Mollie, I got it!"
1039,HILDY,1039,Can you get in this desk?
1040,WILSON,1040,What's going on in there?
1041,WILLIAMS,1041,What good'll it do?
1042,HILDY,1042,We'll get you out in ten minutes.
1043,ENDICOTT,1043,"Open up there, will you!"
1044,HILDY,1044,All right -- all right!
1045,MOLLIE,1045,Go on!
1046,MOLLIE,1046,Please!
1047,WILLIAMS,1047,They'll find me anyhow.
1048,HILDY,1048,I'm coming!
1049,HILDY,1049,Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
1050,MOLLIE,1050,"I'll be right here. I won't leave
you."
1051,ENDICOTT,1051,Hey!
1052,HILDY,1052,"Mollie, drop down here! You've
fainted!"
1053,MOLLIE,1053,What's the idea?
1054,HILDY,1054,Never mind! Just play dead.
1055,MOLLIE,1055,Hey --
1056,HILDY,1056,"Shut up, you!"
1057,ENDICOTT,1057,"Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got
calls to make, you know."
1058,HILDY,1058,"Run down and get some smelling salts,
will you?"
1059,WILSON,1059,Smelling salts! What's going on here?
1060,ENDICOTT,1060,"Mollie Malloy -- what happened to
her?"
1061,HILDY,1061,"Came up here -- had hysterics and
passed out. I've been trying to get
her to come to."
1062,ENDICOTT,1062,"She looks as though she's going to
come to."
1063,HILDY,1063,"Give me a hand with her, will you?"
1064,ENDICOTT,1064,Okay.
1065,ENDICOTT,1065,"Up you go, Mollie."
1066,WILSON,1066,City Desk.
1067,ENDICOTT,1067,She'll be all right.
1068,ENDICOTT,1068,The Desk.
1069,WILSON,1069,"Well, they surrounded the house, all
right, only they forgot to tell
Williams, and he wasn't there."
1070,MURPHY,1070,"Hildy, I thought you were gone --"
1071,HILDY,1071,"Well -- I was going, but Mollie
fainted away and I thought I ought
to do what I could."
1072,MURPHY,1072,"Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside.
The whole police force standing on
it's ear."
1073,MCCUE,1073,What a chase!
1074,ENDICOTT,1074,"No luck on Williams, yet -- call you
back."
1075,WILSON,1075,"Okay, later."
1076,MURPHY,1076,Murphy talking.
1077,HILDY,1077,Any news?
1078,SCHWARTZ,1078,"Yeah. I was never so tired in my
life."
1079,MCCUE,1079,"Where? Harrison Street Station? All
right, connect me."
1080,SCHWARTZ,1080,"Schwartz calling... Out with Hartman's
deputies. I'm in a drugstore. You
can't call me back because I'm going
right on with them."
1081,HILDY,1081,"Are you all right, now?"
1082,MOLLIE,1082,"Yeah, I'm feelin' fine."
1083,MURPHY,1083,"Sure, Mollie, you never looked better
in your life."
1084,MCCUE,1084,"Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks
good. An old lady just called the
detective bureau and claims Williams
is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've
looked every other place. Want to go
out on it?"
1085,ENDICOTT,1085,"Aw, nuts with chasing around any
more. I spent a dollar-forty on taxis
already."
1086,SCHWARTZ,1086,"I say we don't go out any more. Let
Earl Williams come to us."
1087,HILDY,1087,"A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest
story in two years and they're too
lazy to go after it."
1088,ENDICOTT,1088,"It's easy for you to talk. You're
retired. We're still working."
1089,MCCUE,1089,Okay.
1090,MCCUE,1090,Forget it.
1091,HILDY,1091,"What's the matter with you boys?
Afraid it might rain? If you want to
go, I'll cover this end."
1092,MURPHY,1092,"Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound
pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are
you trying to scoop us or something?"
1093,ENDICOTT,1093,"Something smells around here. If you
ask me Mollie gave her the story on
how Williams got that gun."
1094,ENDICOTT,1094,"Did you smuggle that gun into
Williams, Mollie?"
1095,MOLLIE,1095,I didn't do nothin'.
1096,MCCUE,1096,"Come clean, Mollie."
1097,ENDICOTT,1097,"Better let us in on it, Mollie."
1098,HILDY,1098,"Aw, why don't you let her alone?
She's ill!"
1099,MURPHY,1099,"Oh, you two are pals now -- I think
you're right, Endicott. Mollie did
give her some kind of story."
1100,ENDICOTT,1100,"I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We
better hold onto 'em both."
1101,MRS. BALDWIN,1101,Well?
1102,HILDY,1102,Mother!
1103,MRS. BALDWIN,1103,"Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and-
mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him
looked up -- making us miss two trains --
and supposed to be married tomorrow!"
1104,HILDY,1104,"Mother, I can explain everything.
I'll go with you in five minutes and --"
1105,MRS. BALDWIN,1105,"You don't have to go with me at all!
Just give me my son's money and you
can stay here forever as far as I'm
concerned. Stay with that murderer
you caught!"
1106,MRS. BALDWIN'S VOICE,1106,"Which one of these men is it? They
all look like murderers to me!"
1107,MURPHY,1107,Where does she get that stuff?
1108,SCHWARTZ,1108,"Shall we tell her what she looks
like?"
1109,ENDICOTT,1109,"Wait a minute! What murderer did you
catch, Hildy?"
1110,HILDY,1110,"I don't know what she's talking about.
I never said any such thing."
1111,MRS. BALDWIN,1111,"I'm quoting my son, and he has never
lied to me."
1112,REPORTERS,1112,"I knew something stunk around here --
Who says she caught him --? What do
you mean she caught a murderer --?
etc."
1113,HILDY,1113,But I never said anything like that!
1114,MRS. BALDWIN,1114,"Yes, you did!"
1115,MOLLIE,1115,She never told her that!
1116,HILDY,1116,I said I was trying to catch one.
1117,HILDY,1117,"You got it balled up, Mother."
1118,MURPHY,1118,"What do you know about it? How do
you know she didn't?"
1119,MOLLIE,1119,Let go!
1120,ENDICOTT,1120,"Hold on to her, Jimmy -- she's in
with Hildy on this."
1121,MURPHY,1121,"Who you holding out on? Come clean,
or we'll make you wish you had --"
1122,ENDICOTT,1122,"Hildy, are you gonna cross us for
Walter Burns after the way you told
him off?"
1123,WILSON,1123,"Give in, Hildy -- you can't get away
with it."
1124,MOLLIE,1124,"Wait! You stool-pigeons! She don't
know where Williams is. I'm the one
that knows."
1125,ENDICOTT,1125,"What do you mean, you know?"
1126,MOLLIE,1126,"Go find out, you heels! You don't
think I'm gonna tell!"
1127,HILDY,1127,Let her alone! She's goofy!
1128,REPORTERS,1128,"Look out! Close that door! etc.,
etc."
1129,MCCUE,1129,You ain't gettin' out o' here!
1130,ENDICOTT,1130,"Now, where is he?"
1131,WILSON,1131,Where you hidin' him?
1132,MOLLIE,1132,"I ain't gonna squeal! I ain't goin'
to!"
1133,MURPHY,1133,"Come on, you! Before we slap you
down."
1134,ENDICOTT,1134,"Do you want us to call the cops and
have them give you the boots?"
1135,MURPHY,1135,"Where is he, before we beat it out
of you?"
1136,MOLLIE,1136,"Don't you come near me, you kidney
foot!"
1137,MOLLIE,1137,"Let me alone or I'll knock your heads
off!"
1138,ENDICOTT,1138,Put down that chair!
1139,SCHWARTZ,1139,"Get around -- get on the side of
her."
1140,MOLLIE,1140,"No, you don't!"
1141,MOLLIE,1141,Keep away!
1142,WILSON,1142,Grab her!
1143,MOLLIE,1143,You'll never get it out of me!
1144,MOLLIE,1144,I'll never tell! Never!
1145,MRS. BALDWIN,1145,Take me out of here! Take me --
1146,MRS. BALDWIN,1146,Oh-h --
1147,MCCUE,1147,"Get the cops, somebody."
1148,MURPHY,1148,"Come on, fellas."
1149,HILDY,1149,Gee! The poor kid... the poor kid.
1150,VOICES,1150,"Get a doctor! Take her to the
infirmary! She ain't killed -- she's
moving!"
1151,HILDY,1151,Walter! D-did you see --
1152,HILDY,1152,-- that?
1153,BURNS,1153,Yes. Where is he?
1154,HILDY,1154,She jumped out of the window.
1155,BURNS,1155,"I know. Where is he, I said."
1156,MRS. BALDWIN,1156,What are you doing?
1157,BURNS' VOICE,1157,Shut up!
1158,MRS. BALDWIN,1158,"I won't shut up! That girl killed
herself. Oh-h, you're doing something
wrong. What's in that desk?"
1159,BURNS,1159,"Louie, take this lady over to Polack
Mike's and lock her up. See that she
doesn't take to anyone on the way."
1160,MRS. BALDWIN,1160,What's that -- what's that?
1161,HILDY,1161,"Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do
that!"
1162,LOUIE,1162,My name is Louis Peluso.
1163,BURNS,1163,"Tell 'em it's a case of delirium
tremens."
1164,HILDY,1164,"Now, let go of her, Louie. Listen,
Walter, this'll get me in a terrible
jam with my fiancée and I don't stand
so well with him now. Don't worry,
Mother, this is only temporary."
1165,BURNS,1165,Where do you think you're going?
1166,HILDY,1166,"Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce
out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you
have to do this to me?"
1167,BURNS,1167,"Get Bruce out of jail! How can you
worry about a man who's resting
comfortably in a quiet police station
while this is going on? Hildy, this
is war! You can't desert now!"
1168,HILDY,1168,"Oh, get off that trapeze!"
1169,HILDY,1169,"There's your story! Smear it all
over the front page -- Earl Williams
caught by the Morning Post! And take
all the credit -- I covered your
story for you and I got myself in a
fine mess doing it -- and now I'm
getting out! I know I told you that
twice before today -- but this time
I mean it!"
1170,BURNS,1170,"You drooling idiot! What do you mean,
you're getting out! There are three
hundred and sixty-five days in the
year one can get married -- but how
many times have you got a murderer
locked up in a desk? -- Once in a
lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole
city by the seat of the pants!"
1171,HILDY,1171,"I know, but --"
1172,BURNS,1172,"You know! You've got the brain of a
pancake! That wasn't just a story
you covered -- it was a revolution!
Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in
journalism since Livingstone
discovered Stanley for the New York
Herald!"
1173,HILDY,1173,"Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley
who discovered Livingstone?"
1174,BURNS,1174,"Don't get technical at a time like
this! Do you realize what you've
done? You've taken a city that's
been graft-ridden for forty years
under the same old gang and with
this yarn you're kicking 'em out and
giving us a chance to have the same
kind of government that New York's
having under La Guardia! We'll make
such monkeys out of these ward-heelers
next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for
them -- not even their wives!"
1175,HILDY,1175,I'd like to think.
1176,BURNS,1176,"Well, think it then, because it's
true! We'll crucify that mob. We're
going to keep Williams under cover
till morning so the Post can break
the story exclusive. Then we'll let
the Governor in on the capture --
share the glory with him."
1177,HILDY,1177,I get it!
1178,BURNS,1178,"You've kicked over the whole City
Hall like an apple-cart. You've got
the Mayor and Hartman backed against
a wall. You've put one administration
out and another in. This isn't a
newspaper story -- it's a career!
And you stand there belly-aching
about whether you catch an eight
o'clock train or a nine o'clock train!
Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all
you are."
1179,HILDY,1179,"Let me get at that typewriter and
I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg
can write!"
1180,BURNS,1180,"Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming
streets after you -- Hildy Johnson
Street! There'll be statues of you
in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be
after you -- the movies!"
1181,BURNS,1181,"By tomorrow morning I'll betcha
there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can
see the billboards now. Light up
with Hildy Johnson!"
1182,HILDY,1182,"Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave
Williams here. One of the other
fellows'll --"
1183,BURNS,1183,"We're going to take him over to my
private office."
1184,BURNS,1184,Where's our phone?
1185,HILDY,1185,"That one -- how you gonna take him?
They'll see him."
1186,BURNS,1186,"Not if he's inside the desk. We'll
carry the desk over."
1187,BURNS,1187,Give me Duffy!
1188,HILDY,1188,"You can't take that desk out. It's
crawling with cops outside."
1189,BURNS,1189,"We'll lower it out of the window
with pulleys. Quit stallin'."
1190,BURNS,1190,Hildy!
1191,HILDY,1191,Huh!
1192,BURNS,1192,"Get the lead out of your typewriter
and start pounding out a load, will
you? Snap into it!"
1193,HILDY,1193,How much do you want on it?
1194,BURNS,1194,All the words you've got.
1195,HILDY,1195,Where's some paper?
1196,BURNS,1196,Hello...! Hello!
1197,HILDY,1197,"Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey --
or is that libelous?"
1198,BURNS,1198,"Call him a love-child, if you want
to."
1199,BURNS,1199,Duffy!
1200,HILDY,1200,"How about the time he had his house
painted by the Fire Department?"
1201,BURNS,1201,Give him the works.
1202,BURNS,1202,"Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the
biggest story in the world. Earl
Williams caught by the Morning Post --
exclusive!"
1203,BURNS,1203,Fine!
1204,BURNS,1204,"Now, listen, Duffy -- I want you to
tear out the whole front page...
That's what I said -- the whole front
page! Never mind the European war!
We've got something a whole lot bigger
than that. Hildy Johnson's writing
the lead and I'll phone it over to
you as soon as she's finished."
1205,BURNS,1205,"Oh, Duffy! Get hold of Butch O'Connor
and tell him I want him to come up
here with half a dozen other wrestlers --
right away! Tell him we'll run his
picture on the sport page for two
weeks straight. What? I've got a
desk I want moved. Never mind what
desk!"
1206,BURNS' VOICE,1206,"""The Blackest cesspool in American
city life!"" Hold on Duffy, I'll see
if she's got any more."
1207,BURNS,1207,Duffy -- Duffy!
1208,BURNS,1208,"Operator! Operator! Get me Duffy
back. Somebody cut us off!"
1209,BRUCE,1209,Hildy!
1210,BURNS,1210,"What the devil do you want? Listen,
Bruce, you can't come in here now!
We're busy!"
1211,BURNS,1211,"Where you been, Duffy? Stick around!
What? What Chinese earthquake? The
deuce with it... what's that?"
1212,BRUCE,1212,Hildy!
1213,HILDY,1213,"Hello, Bruce..."
1214,HILDY,1214,BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
1215,BRUCE,1215,"Not through any help of yours, Hildy."
1216,HILDY,1216,"Bruce, I know, but I was in the
biggest jam --"
1217,BURNS' VOICE,1217,Hildy!
1218,BURNS,1218,"For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're
waiting for the rest of that story!"
1219,HILDY,1219,"Okay, Walter."
1220,BRUCE,1220,"I waited and waited and then I had
an idea and wired Albany to send me
a hundred dollars so I could get out
on bail..."
1221,BRUCE,1221,"I don't know what they'll think --
they sent it to the police station!"
1222,HILDY,1222,"We'll explain the whole thing to
them."
1223,BRUCE,1223,"I know I got you into this, Hildy,
but it does seem to me that you can't
care much for me if you're willing
to let me stay locked up for two
hours."
1224,HILDY,1224,"Bruce, you know I'm mad about you
and stop talking like that."
1225,HILDY,1225,Walter!
1226,BURNS,1226,"Take the President's speech and run
it on the funny page..."
1227,BURNS,1227,"What is it, Hildy?"
1228,HILDY'S VOICE,1228,"What was the name of the Mayor's
first wife?"
1229,BURNS,1229,"You mean the one who drank so much?
Tillie!"
1230,HILDY,1230,Thanks.
1231,BURNS,1231,"Get back in there, you mock turtle!"
1232,BRUCE,1232,"Did you say anything, Mister Burns?"
1233,BURNS,1233,"No -- I was just talking to one of
the guys at the office."
1234,BRUCE,1234,Oh.
1235,BRUCE,1235,"I wonder what's keeping mother? She
was supposed to come down and get
you."
1236,HILDY,1236,"Oh, she was here."
1237,BRUCE,1237,Where'd she go?
1238,HILDY,1238,Out some place.
1239,BRUCE,1239,Hildy! Where's mother?
1240,HILDY,1240,"Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know
where she went."
1241,BRUCE,1241,Did you give her the money?
1242,HILDY,1242,"No, I was going to give it to her --
but she left hurriedly."
1243,BRUCE,1243,"Then suppose you give me the money.
Four hundred and fifty dollars."
1244,HILDY,1244,"Oh, yes. Here it is."
1245,HILDY,1245,"Here it is, Bruce. One -- two --
three -- four hundred -- and fifty
dollars."
1246,BRUCE,1246,Thank you.
1247,BRUCE,1247,"And I'll take that certified check,
too. I've decided I can handle things
around here..."
1248,BURNS,1248,"Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep
going! Sorry, Bruce, but --"
1249,HILDY,1249,"Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce,
here's the check... And, oh, Bruce,
here's your wallet. I got it back."
1250,BRUCE,1250,"You got it back, eh? There's something
funny going on around here."
1251,BURNS,1251,Hildy!
1252,HILDY,1252,"All right, Walter."
1253,BRUCE,1253,"I'm taking the nine o'clock train,
Hildy. And you can meet us at the
station."
1254,HILDY,1254,Fine.
1255,BURNS,1255,"I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise
you."
1256,BRUCE,1256,"If she's not there, mother and I are
leaving anyhow!"
1257,BURNS,1257,"I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've
got to forgive her. She's only a
woman, after all."
1258,BRUCE,1258,"Suppose she is -- I have feelings,
too! Do you know where I've been for
the last couple of hours? Locked up
in a police station and she didn't
move to do anything about it."
1259,BURNS,1259,Ts! Ts! Ts!
1260,BRUCE,1260,"And now I don't know where my mother
is. She may be lost."
1261,BURNS,1261,"I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to
put every detective in the city on
the job. Tell you what -- go over to
the Missing Persons Bureau and
describe your mother. What does she
look like?"
1262,BRUCE,1262,"She's -- well, she's very motherly.
That's about the best description I
know."
1263,BURNS,1263,That's the kind of stuff they want!
1264,BURNS,1264,"Oh, Bruce, let me see that money
Hildy gave you."
1265,BRUCE,1265,The money? Why?
1266,BURNS,1266,"There's a lot of counterfeit big
bills going around."
1267,BRUCE,1267,"Gee! Take a look, will you?"
1268,BURNS,1268,"Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just
wanted to be sure."
1269,BRUCE,1269,"Say, I want to be sure, too!"
1270,BURNS,1270,Duffy. Good. Stick close.
1271,BURNS,1271,Now the moon's out!
1272,BURNS,1272,"Fine. Three taps is me. Don't forget!
You're sitting pretty, now. Got enough
air?"
1273,BURNS,1273,Is that better? Now breathe deep!
1274,BURNS,1274,Attaboy!
1275,BURNS,1275,"That's the stuff! Lam it into 'em,
Hildy."
1276,BURNS,1276,"Hello! Duffy, ready? Here we go!"
1277,BURNS,1277,"""In the darkest hour of the city's
history --"""
1278,BURNS,1278,"Listen, did you impress it on Butch
that I want him and his gang here
right away? You did? Every minute
counts. All right."
1279,BURNS,1279,Duffy's getting old!
1280,HILDY,1280,Where's Butch?
1281,BURNS' VOICE,1281,He's on the way.
1282,HILDY,1282,"He'd better hurry. The boys'll be
coming back to phone."
1283,BURNS,1283,"Well, keep going! We want an extra
out on the streets before it's too
late!"
1284,HILDY,1284,Where's Bruce?
1285,BURNS,1285,"Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to
get the tickets."
1286,HILDY,1286,What tickets?
1287,BURNS,1287,Railroad tickets.
1288,HILDY,1288,Is he coming back here?
1289,BURNS,1289,"Didn't you hear him? Of course he's
coming back here. Keep going, will
you?"
1290,BURNS,1290,Duffy!
1291,HILDY,1291,Who is it?
1292,BENSINGER,1292,What's the idea of locking this?
1293,HILDY,1293,That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
1294,BURNS,1294,What's his name?
1295,HILDY,1295,Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
1296,BENSINGER,1296,Open this door!
1297,BURNS,1297,I'll handle him.
1298,BURNS,1298,"The Tribune, eh? Watch me!"
1299,BENSINGER,1299,Ain't you got any more sense than to --
1300,BENSINGER,1300,"Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite
an honor having you come over here."
1301,BURNS,1301,"Hello, Bensinger."
1302,BENSINGER,1302,"Excuse me, I just want to --"
1303,BURNS,1303,"Quite a coincidence, my running into
you tonight. Isn't it, Hildy?"
1304,HILDY'S VOICE,1304,Yeh.
1305,BENSINGER,1305,How do you mean?
1306,BURNS,1306,"I was having a little chat about you
just this afternoon -- with our Mister
Duffy."
1307,BENSINGER,1307,"Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope."
1308,BURNS,1308,"I should say not! That was one swell
story you had in the paper this
morning."
1309,BENSINGER,1309,"Oh, did you -- care for the poem,
Mr. Burns?"
1310,BURNS,1310,The poem?... The poem was great!
1311,BENSINGER,1311,Remember the ending?
1312,BENSINGER,1312,""" -- and all is well, outside his
cell, But in his heart he hears the
hangman Calling and the gallows
falling And his white-haired mother's
tears..."""
1313,BURNS,1313,"Heartbreaking! How would you like to
work for me?"
1314,BENSINGER,1314,What?
1315,BURNS,1315,"We need somebody like you. All we've
got now are a lot of low-brows. Like
Johnson here."
1316,BENSINGER,1316,"Seriously, Mr. Burns?"
1317,BURNS,1317,"Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to
see you."
1318,BURNS,1318,"Mervyn, isn't it?"
1319,BENSINGER,1319,No. Roy. Roy V.
1320,BURNS,1320,Of course!
1321,BURNS,1321,"Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course
you wouldn't know! You probably never
heard of Shakespeare, either! Put
Mr. Bensinger right on the staff."
1322,BURNS,1322,"How much are you getting on the
Tribune, Roy?"
1323,BENSINGER,1323,Seventy-five.
1324,BURNS,1324,"I'll give you a hundred and a by-
line."
1325,BURNS,1325,Let him have everything he wants.
1326,BURNS,1326,"Now hustle and write me a story from
the point of view of the escaped
man."
1327,BURNS,1327,"He hides, cowering... Afraid of every
light, of every sound... hears
footsteps... his heart going like
that... And all the time they're
closing in... Get the sense of an
animal at bay!"
1328,BENSINGER,1328,Sort of a Jack London style?
1329,BURNS,1329,Exactly!
1330,BENSINGER,1330,I got my rhyming dictionary in --
1331,BURNS,1331,It doesn't have to rhyme!
1332,BENSINGER,1332,"Gee, I'm terribly grateful, Mister
Burns. Do you suppose there might be
an opening some time as foreign
correspondent? I parley a little
French, you know."
1333,BURNS,1333,I'll keep you in mind.
1334,BENSINGER,1334,"Au revoir, mon capitaine."
1335,BURNS,1335,Bon jour!
1336,BURNS,1336,"Mademoiselle from Armontieres, parlay --"
1337,BURNS,1337,Duffy! Got this!
1338,BURNS,1338,"A rat from the Tribune is coming
over to get a job -- Bensinger, the
guy I told you about. Handle him
with kid gloves. Tell him to get
busy writing poetry... No, we don't
want him. Stall him along until the
extra comes out. Then tell him his
poetry stinks and kick him downstairs."
1339,HILDY,1339,Double-crossing swine!
1340,BURNS,1340,"You said it! But this'll teach him a
lesson. He won't quit his paper
without giving notice after this."
1341,BURNS,1341,"Tear into it, will you? Don't sit
there like a frozen robin!"
1342,HILDY,1342,I'm finished.
1343,BURNS,1343,Finished!
1344,BURNS,1344,"Duffy! All right -- here we go! And
got it out as soon as you can. I
want this paper out on the streets
in half an hour!"
1345,BURNS,1345,"""So once more the Morning Post --"""
1346,HILDY,1346,"Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter,
you're not trying anything again,
are you?"
1347,BURNS,1347,"Hildy, you think I could? After this
story?"
1348,BURNS,1348,Here! You're just nervous.
1349,BURNS,1349,Who is it?
1350,LOUIE'S VOICE,1350,"It's me, Boss -- Louie."
1351,BURNS,1351,It's Louie!
1352,BURNS,1352,What's the matter?
1353,HILDY,1353,Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
1354,BURNS,1354,What did you do with her?
1355,HILDY,1355,What happened?
1356,BURNS,1356,You been in a fight?
1357,LOUIE,1357,"Down Western Avenue. We were going
sixty-five miles an hour. You know
what I mean?"
1358,BURNS,1358,Take that mush out of your mouth!
1359,HILDY,1359,Where's the old lady?
1360,LOUIE,1360,I'm telling you!
1361,LOUIE,1361,"We run smack into a police patrol.
You know what I mean? We broke it in
half!"
1362,HILDY,1362,Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
1363,BURNS,1363,Where is she? Tell me!
1364,HILDY,1364,Louie!
1365,LOUIE,1365,"I'm telling you. Can you imagine
bumping into a load of cops?! They
come rollin' out like oranges!"
1366,HILDY,1366,What did you do with her?
1367,LOUIE,1367,"Search me! When I come to I was
running down Thirty-fifth Street."
1368,HILDY,1368,"-- You were with her. You were in
the cab, weren't you?"
1369,LOUIE,1369,Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
1370,BURNS,1370,"Butter-fingers! I give you an old
lady to take somewhere, and you hand
her over to the cops!"
1371,LOUIE,1371,"What do you mean, I handed her? The
patrol wagon was on the wrong side
of the street."
1372,BURNS,1372,"Now everything's fine. She's probably
squawking her head off in some police
station."
1373,LOUIE,1373,"I don't think she's talking much...
You know what I mean?"
1374,HILDY,1374,Don't tell me -- was she killed?
1375,BURNS,1375,Was she? Did you notice?
1376,LOUIE,1376,"Say, me with a gun on my hip and a
kidnapped old lady on my hands, I
should stick around asking questions
from a lot of cops! You know what I
mean?"
1377,HILDY,1377,Dead... dead! That's the end!
1378,BURNS,1378,"It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will
be."
1379,HILDY,1379,"What am I going to say to Bruce?
What'll I tell him?"
1380,BURNS,1380,"If he really loves you, you won't
have to tell him anything."
1381,BURNS,1381,"Snap out of it! Would you rather
have had the old dame dragging the
whole police force in here?"
1382,HILDY,1382,"I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh-
h... what can I do now? How can I
ever face him? Oh, I hope he never
comes back!"
1383,BURNS,1383,"Look at me, Hildy --"
1384,HILDY,1384,I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
1385,BURNS,1385,"If it was my own mother, I'd carry
on! You know I would. For the paper!"
1386,HILDY,1386,"Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going
out!"
1387,BURNS,1387,"You stay here. I'll find out
everything."
1388,LOUIE,1388,Western an' Thirty-fourth.
1389,BURNS,1389,Hello -- hello...
1390,HILDY,1390,Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
1391,BURNS,1391,Who?
1392,BURNS,1392,"Hello, Butch! Where are you?"
1393,HILDY,1393,"Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving
Room."
1394,BURNS,1394,"What are you doing there? Haven't
you even started?"
1395,HILDY,1395,"Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was
there an old lady brought in from an
auto smashup?"
1396,BURNS,1396,"Oh, for --"
1397,BURNS,1397,"H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's
a matter of life and death! Listen!"
1398,HILDY,1398,Nobody?
1399,HILDY,1399,Morningside three-one-two-four.
1400,BURNS,1400,"I can't hear... You got who? Speak
up! A what?... You can't stop for a
dame now!"
1401,HILDY,1401,Is this the Community Hospital?
1402,BURNS,1402,"I don't care if you've been after
her for six years! Butch, our whole
lives are at stake! Are you going to
let a woman come between us after
all we've been through?"
1403,HILDY,1403,"Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there
an old lady --?"
1404,BURNS,1404,"Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for
you -- up to here!"
1405,BURNS,1405,"Now, you can't double-cross me!...
She does? All right -- put her on.
I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello,
Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent
glamour girl, you can't keep Butch
away from his duty... What's that?
You say that again and I'll come
over there and knock your eye out!
Hello?"
1406,BURNS,1406,"I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of
'em!"
1407,BURNS,1407,Duffy!
1408,BURNS,1408,"Mousing around with some big blonde
Annie on my time! That's co-operation!"
1409,BURNS,1409,Duffy!!
1410,HILDY,1410,"Shut up, will you?"
1411,HILDY,1411,You sure? Nobody?
1412,BURNS,1412,Duffy!!!!
1413,BURNS,1413,Duffy!!!!
1414,BURNS,1414,"Well, where is Duffy?"
1415,BURNS,1415,"Diabetes! I ought to know better
than to hire anybody with a disease."
1416,BURNS,1416,Louie.
1417,BURNS,1417,It's up to you.
1418,LOUIE,1418,"Anything you want, Boss."
1419,BURNS,1419,"Beat it out and get hold of some
guys."
1420,LOUIE,1420,Who do you want?
1421,BURNS,1421,"Anybody with hair on his chest. Get
'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer
them anything -- only get them."
1422,BURNS,1422,"We've got to get this desk out of
here."
1423,LOUIE,1423,You know me. The shirt off my back.
1424,BURNS,1424,You got plenty of money?
1425,LOUIE,1425,"Sure, boss."
1426,BURNS,1426,I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
1427,LOUIE,1427,I always have both.
1428,BURNS,1428,And don't bump into anything.
1429,HILDY,1429,Lafayette two-one-hundred.
1430,BURNS,1430,"That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I
know it."
1431,BURNS,1431,"Can you imagine Butch doing this to
me -- at a time like this?"
1432,BURNS,1432,"If Louie doesn't come back in five
minutes we'll get it out alone.
There's millions of ways. We can
start a fire and get the firemen to
carry it out in the confusion."
1433,HILDY,1433,"Ring that number, will you?"
1434,BURNS,1434,Come here. See if we can move it.
1435,HILDY,1435,"Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying --
In Hospital? Did you have an auto
accident in the last --"
1436,BURNS,1436,Will you come here?
1437,HILDY,1437,"Oh, I see. I beg your pardon."
1438,BURNS,1438,"When I'm surrounded, with my back
against the wall, you're not going
to lay down on me, are you --"
1439,HILDY,1439,Yes.
1440,BURNS,1440,"Hildy, you just can't leave me out
on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be
cricket!"
1441,HILDY,1441,"I don't care what you say. I'm going
to find Bruce's mother."
1442,HILDY,1442,Oh-h...
1443,HILDY,1443,I'm going out and find her!
1444,BURNS,1444,Don't open that!
1445,HILDY,1445,"Who says so? I'm going to the morgue --
to look --"
1446,MURPHY,1446,There she is!
1447,MCCUE,1447,"Say, Hildy..."
1448,HARTMAN,1448,"Just a minute, Johnson!"
1449,HILDY,1449,Let go o' me. What's the idea?
1450,MCCUE,1450,What's your hurry?
1451,MURPHY,1451,We want to see you.
1452,HILDY,1452,Take your paws off me!
1453,HARTMAN,1453,"Hold her, boys!"
1454,BURNS,1454,"Who do you think you are, breaking
in here like this?"
1455,HARTMAN,1455,"You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't
care who you are or what paper you're
editor of."
1456,HILDY,1456,Let me go!
1457,HILDY,1457,"Fellows, something's happened to my
mother-in-law."
1458,HARTMAN,1458,Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
1459,MCCUE,1459,We know what you're up to.
1460,ENDICOTT,1460,Probably goin' out to get Williams.
1461,SCHWARTZ,1461,The door was locked.
1462,WILSON,1462,She and Mollie were talking.
1463,HILDY,1463,"I don't know anything, I tell you.
There's been an accident."
1464,HARTMAN,1464,"Johnson, there's something very
peculiar going on."
1465,HILDY,1465,"You can send somebody with me if you
don't believe me!"
1466,HARTMAN,1466,"I wasn't born yesterday. Now the
boys tell me you and this Mollie
Malloy --"
1467,HILDY,1467,"Nobody's trying to put anything over
on you. I'm getting out of here and
you can't stop me!"
1468,MURPHY,1468,You're not going anywhere.
1469,MURPHY,1469,"She's got the story sewed up, Pete."
1470,MURPHY,1470,That's why Burns is here.
1471,SCHWARTZ,1471,"We're on to you, Hildy. Let us in on
it."
1472,BURNS,1472,"If you've any accusations to make,
Hartman, make them in the proper
manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask
you to get out."
1473,HARTMAN,1473,You'll ask me to what?
1474,BURNS,1474,Get out!
1475,HARTMAN,1475,"Close that door. Don't let anybody
in or out."
1476,MURPHY,1476,"Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little
third degree."
1477,ENDICOTT,1477,"Make them talk and you got Williams,
Pinky!"
1478,HARTMAN,1478,"Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of
this. What do you know about Williams?
Are you going to talk or aren't you?"
1479,HILDY,1479,What do I know about Williams?
1480,HARTMAN,1480,"All right, boys. Take her along. I
got ways of making her talk."
1481,HILDY,1481,"Look out, you --"
1482,MCCUE,1482,"What's the use of fighting, Hildy?"
1483,DEPUTIES,1483,"Hey, she's got a gun! Look out, she's
got a gun!"
1484,HILDY,1484,"No, you don't! Walter!"
1485,BURNS,1485,What is it? Here!
1486,HARTMAN,1486,Gimme that.
1487,HARTMAN,1487,Where'd you get this?
1488,HILDY,1488,"I've got a right to carry a gun if I
want to."
1489,HARTMAN,1489,Not this gun!
1490,BURNS,1490,"I can explain that, Hartman. When
Hildy told me she wanted to interview
Earl Williams I thought it might be
dangerous and I gave her a gun to
defend herself."
1491,HARTMAN,1491,"Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very
interesting. This happens to be the
gun that Earl Williams shot his way
out with!"
1492,REPORTERS AD LIB,1492,What? What's that? Etc...
1493,BURNS,1493,Are you trying to make me out a liar?
1494,MURPHY,1494,"It's the last time I ever trust a
woman, Hildy."
1495,SCHWARTZ,1495,"Maybe Williams was gonna be her best
man."
1496,WILSON,1496,"That's pretty rotten, Hildy. Crossing
your own pals."
1497,HARTMAN,1497,"Where is Earl Williams? Where you
got him?"
1498,BURNS,1498,"You're barking up the wrong tree,
Hartman."
1499,HARTMAN,1499,"I'll give you three minutes to tell
me where he is."
1500,HILDY,1500,"He went over to the hospital to call
on Professor Egelhoffer."
1501,HARTMAN,1501,What?
1502,HILDY,1502,With a bag of marshmallows.
1503,REPORTERS AD LIB,1503,"Come on, Hildy. Where is he?... This
is a sweet trick, Hildy... I thought
we were friends... Etc."
1504,REPORTERS AD LIB,1504,"Look here, Pete! What about Mister
Burns?... Ask the Master Mind! What's
he doing over here?"
1505,HARTMAN,1505,"Speak up! What do you know about
this."
1506,BURNS,1506,My dear Hartman!
1507,MURPHY,1507,Can that! Where is he?
1508,BURNS,1508,"The Morning Post is not obstructing
justice or hiding criminals. You
ought to know that."
1509,HARTMAN,1509,No? Well --
1510,HARTMAN,1510,"Johnson, you're under arrest."
1511,HARTMAN,1511,"You, too, Burns."
1512,BURNS,1512,"Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed,
square-toed spy -- do you realize
what you're doing?"
1513,HARTMAN,1513,"I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns,
you're guilty of obstructing justice
and so is the Morning Post. I'm going
to see that the Post is fined ten
thousand dollars for this."
1514,BURNS,1514,"You'll see nothing of the kind,
Sheriff."
1515,HARTMAN,1515,"We'll just start by impounding the
Post property."
1516,HARTMAN,1516,Is that your desk?
1517,HILDY,1517,No!
1518,BURNS,1518,"Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I
dare him to move that desk out of
here."
1519,HARTMAN,1519,"Oh, you do, eh?"
1520,HARTMAN,1520,"All right, boys. Confiscate that
desk."
1521,BURNS,1521,"Hartman, if you take this desk out
of this building, I'll put you behind
bars."
1522,HARTMAN,1522,"You will, eh? Well, we'll see about
that."
1523,HARTMAN,1523,"All right, boys. Take it."
1524,BURNS,1524,"I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal
offense."
1525,BURNS,1525,And you'll be an accessory!
1526,HARTMAN,1526,"We'll take a chance on that, Burns."
1527,HARTMAN,1527,"Go ahead, boys."
1528,MRS. BALDWIN,1528,"You wait outside, Bruce."
1529,BRUCE,1529,"But, mother --"
1530,MRS. BALDWIN,1530,"No! You'll weaken when you see that
little Jezebel! I'm going to tell
her what I think of her!"
1531,HILDY,1531,Mother!
1532,MRS. BALDWIN,1532,That man there!
1533,HILDY,1533,"Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you!
Are you all right? Tell me."
1534,HARTMAN,1534,What's the idea here?
1535,POLICEMAN,1535,This lady claims she was kidnapped.
1536,HARTMAN,1536,What?
1537,MRS. BALDWIN,1537,"They dragged me all the way down the
stairs --"
1538,HARTMAN,1538,Just a minute. Did -- did --
1539,HARTMAN,1539,"-- this man have anything to do with
it?"
1540,MRS. BALDWIN,1540,"He was the one in charge of
everything! He told them to kidnap
me!"
1541,BURNS,1541,"Are you referring to me, Madam?"
1542,MRS. BALDWIN,1542,You know you did!
1543,HARTMAN,1543,"What about this, Burns? Kidnapping,
eh?"
1544,BURNS,1544,"Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never
saw this woman before in my life!"
1545,MRS. BALDWIN,1545,"Oh, what a thing to say! I was
standing right here - after the girl
jumped out of the window."
1546,HARTMAN,1546,Did you get the Mayor?
1547,DEPUTY,1547,He's coming over.
1548,BURNS,1548,"Now, Madam -- be honest. If you were
out joy-riding, drunk, and got into
some scrape, why don't you admit it,
instead of accusing innocent people?"
1549,MRS. BALDWIN,1549,"You ruffian! How dare you say a thing
like that?"
1550,HILDA,1550,"Please, Mother, he's just crazy!"
1551,MRS. BALDWIN,1551,"I'll tell you something more. I'll
tell you why they did it!"
1552,BURNS,1552,"Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get
bail."
1553,MRS. BALDWIN,1553,"I was in here -- and they had some
kind of murderer in with them. They
were hiding him!"
1554,HARTMAN,1554,Hiding him? In here?
1555,MURPHY,1555,Hiding him where?
1556,HILDY,1556,Mother!
1557,REPORTERS,1557,"Where was he?... Where'd they have
him?... Etc."
1558,BURNS,1558,"Madam, you're a cockeyed liar! And
you know it!"
1559,BURNS,1559,"Come on, Sheriff, we've got to get
bail."
1560,HARTMAN,1560,What was that?
1561,REPORTERS AD LIB,1561,"He's in the desk! -- For the love of --
He's in there! Etc."
1562,HARTMAN,1562,"Aha! I thought so! Stand back,
everybody!"
1563,DEPUTY,1563,"Look out, Sheriff. He may shoot!"
1564,HARTMAN,1564,Get your guns out!
1565,HILDY,1565,He's harmless.
1566,HARTMAN,1566,"Don't take any chances. Shoot through
the desk."
1567,HILDY,1567,"He can't hurt anybody. You've got
his gun."
1568,MRS. BALDWIN,1568,"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"
1569,BURNS,1569,You grey-haired old Judas!
1570,MRS. BALDWIN,1570,Let me out! Let me out of here!
1571,HARTMAN,1571,You stand there!
1572,MURPHY'S VOICE,1572,City Desk! Quick!
1573,SCHWARTZ' VOICE,1573,Gimme the Desk!
1574,HARTMAN,1574,You there!
1575,ENDICOTT'S VOICE,1575,City Desk! Hurry!
1576,MCCUE'S VOICE,1576,Gimme Emil...
1577,HARTMAN,1577,You cover the window.
1578,MURPHY'S VOICE,1578,"Look out where you're pointing that
gun!"
1579,WILSON'S VOICE,1579,Lemme have the Desk! Quick!
1580,MURPHY'S VOICE,1580,"Hold the wire! I've got a flash for
you!"
1581,BURNS,1581,Call Duffy!
1582,HARTMAN,1582,"No, you don't!"
1583,BURNS,1583,Do you want to get us scooped?
1584,MCCUE'S VOICE,1584,Emil? Hang on for a second.
1585,HARTMAN,1585,"Now then, everybody aim at the center.
And when I say three --"
1586,HILDY,1586,That's murder!
1587,HARTMAN,1587,"All right! Carl! Frank! One of you
get on each side of the desk. Take
hold of the cover."
1588,HARTMAN,1588,"Now then! We got you covered,
Williams. Don't try to move. Now!
Everybody quiet and ready for an
emergency. I'm going to count three."
1589,SCHWARTZ,1589,Hold it! Something coming up.
1590,HARTMAN,1590,One!
1591,ENDICOTT,1591,Hold the phone!
1592,MURPHY,1592,I'll have it in a minute.
1593,HARTMAN,1593,Two!
1594,WILSON,1594,Right away now!
1595,HARTMAN,1595,"Everybody ready? All right. Now then,
up with it."
1596,HARTMAN,1596,"Got you, Williams!"
1597,WILLIAMS,1597,Go on -- shoot me!
1598,MURPHY'S VOICE,1598,"Earl Williams was just captured in
the Press Room of the Criminal Courts
Building, hiding in a desk."
1599,OFFICERS AD LIB,1599,"Grab him! That's him! Don't let him
shoot! Stick 'em up! -- Etc."
1600,MCCUE,1600,...Williams in a rolltop --
1601,WILSON,1601,-- nabbed Williams hiding --
1602,ENDICOTT'S VOICE,1602,-- found Williams' hiding place.
1603,SCHWARTZ' VOICE,1603,He offered no resistance.
1604,MCCUE,1604,"Williams put up a desperate struggle
but the police overpowered --"
1605,MURPHY,1605,"-- tried to shoot it out with the
cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --"
1606,WILSON'S VOICE,1606,"-- trying to break through the cordon
of police --"
1607,ENDICOTT,1607,"Williams was unconscious when they
opened the desk --"
1608,BURNS,1608,"Duffy! The Morning Post just turned
Earl Williams over to the Sheriff."
1609,BURNS,1609,Duffy!
1610,HARTMAN,1610,Put the cuffs on those two!
1611,ENDICOTT,1611,"An anonymous note received by the
Sheriff led to Williams' capture.
More later."
1612,MURPHY,1612,"An old sweetheart of Williams'
doublecrossed him. Call you back."
1613,REPORTERS,1613,"Where's that old lady? Hey, Madam!
Where'd she go? Where's the old dame?
Etc., etc. They run out after Mrs.
Baldwin, the Mayor entering just
after they go. Burns and Hildy,
handcuffed together, stand near the
Sheriff."
1614,HARTMAN,1614,"Hello, girlie -- gimme Cooley. Quick!"
1615,BURNS,1615,"Hartwell, you're going to wish you'd
never been born!"
1616,MAYOR,1616,"Fine work, Pete! You certainly
delivered the goods. I'm proud of
you."
1617,HARTMAN,1617,"Look kind o' natural, don't they,
Fred?"
1618,MAYOR,1618,A sight for sore eyes!
1619,HARTMAN,1619,"Aiding an escaped criminal! And a
little charge of kidnapping I'm
looking into."
1620,HARTMAN,1620,"But that's the jail! There must be
somebody there!"
1621,MAYOR,1621,"Well! Looks like about ten years
apiece for you birds!"
1622,BURNS,1622,"Does it? You forget the power that
always watches over the Morning Post."
1623,MAYOR,1623,Your luck's not with you now!
1624,HARTMAN,1624,"Cooley?... I caught Williams single-
handed -- we're going to proceed
with the hanging per schedule!"
1625,BURNS,1625,"You're going to be in office for
exactly two days more and then we're
pulling your nose out of the feed
bag."
1626,HARTMAN,1626,"Give me the District Attorney's
office."
1627,HARTMAN,1627,"I'll tell you what you'll be doing --
making brooms in the State
penitentiary."
1628,HARTMAN,1628,"Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell.
Come over to my office, will you?
I've just arrested a couple of
important birds and I want to take
their confessions."
1629,BURNS,1629,Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
1630,MAYOR,1630,"All the lawyers in the world aren't
going to help you!"
1631,BURNS,1631,"This is the Morning Post you're
talking to!"
1632,MAYOR,1632,"The power of the press, huh!"
1633,BURNS,1633,"Bigger men than you have found out
what the power of the press is...
President!... Yes -- and Kings!"
1634,PINKUS,1634,Here's your reprieve.
1635,MAYOR,1635,Get out of here!
1636,PINKUS,1636,You can't bribe me!
1637,BURNS,1637,What's this?
1638,HARTMAN,1638,"Get out of here, you!"
1639,PINKUS,1639,I won't. Here's your reprieve.
1640,HILDY,1640,What?
1641,PINKUS,1641,"I don't want to be City Sealer. I
don't like seals anyhow. They smell."
1642,MAYOR,1642,Who is this man?
1643,HARTMAN,1643,"Throw him out, Frank."
1644,HILDY,1644,Who was bribing you?
1645,PINKUS,1645,They wouldn't take it.
1646,MAYOR,1646,You're insane!
1647,BURNS,1647,What did I tell you? An unseen power!
1648,BURNS,1648,What's your name?
1649,PINKUS,1649,Silas F. Pinkus.
1650,MAYOR,1650,"You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The
idea of coming here with a cock-and-
bull story like that!"
1651,HARTMAN,1651,It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
1652,HILDY,1652,Wait a minute!
1653,HILDY,1653,Let go there!
1654,BURNS,1654,"Murder, uh?"
1655,HILDY,1655,"Hanging an innocent man to win an
election!"
1656,HARTMAN,1656,That's a lie!!
1657,MAYOR,1657,I never saw him before!
1658,BURNS,1658,When did you deliver this first?
1659,HILDY,1659,Who did you talk to?
1660,PINKUS,1660,They started right in bribing me!
1661,HILDY,1661,Who's 'they'?
1662,PINKUS,1662,Them!
1663,MAYOR,1663,"That's absurd on the face of it, Mr.
Burns! He's talking like a child."
1664,BURNS,1664,Out of the mouths of babes.
1665,MAYOR,1665,"He's insane or drunk or something.
Why, if this unfortunate man,
Williams, has really been reprieved,
I personally am tickled to death.
Aren't you, Pete?"
1666,HILDY,1666,"Go on, you'd kill your mother to get
elected!"
1667,MAYOR,1667,"That's a horrible thing to say, Miss
Johnson, about anybody!"
1668,MAYOR,1668,"Now, look here, Walter, you're an
intelligent man --"
1669,BURNS,1669,Just a minute.
1670,BURNS,1670,"All right, Mr. Pinkus. Let's have
your story."
1671,PINKUS,1671,"Well, I been married for ten years
and --"
1672,BURNS,1672,Skip all that.
1673,MAYOR,1673,"Take those handcuffs off our friends,
Pete. That wasn't at all necessary."
1674,HARTMAN,1674,I was just going to!
1675,MAYOR,1675,"Walter, I can't tell you how badly I
feel about this. There was no excuse
for Hartwell to fly off the handle."
1676,HARTMAN,1676,"I was only doing my duty. Nothing
personal in it."
1677,HILDY,1677,"You guys better quit politics and
take in washing."
1678,MAYOR,1678,"Sheriff, this document is authentic!
Earl Williams has been reprieved,
this Commonwealth has been spared
the painful necessity of shedding
blood."
1679,BURNS,1679,Save that for the Tribune.
1680,MAYOR,1680,"What did you say your name was --
Pinkus?"
1681,PINKUS,1681,That's right.
1682,PINKUS,1682,Here's the picture of my wife.
1683,MAYOR,1683,A very fine-looking women.
1684,PINKUS,1684,"She's good enough for me! And if I
was to go home and tell my wife --"
1685,MAYOR,1685,"I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus,
and as long as I am Mayor --"
1686,BURNS,1686,"Which ought to be about three hours
more, I'd say."
1687,HILDY,1687,"Just until we can get out a special
edition asking for your impeachment."
1688,BURNS,1688,"And your arrest. You'll each get
about ten years, I think."
1689,MAYOR,1689,"Don't make any hasty decisions, Mr.
Burns, you might run into a thumping
big libel suit."
1690,HILDY,1690,You're going to run into the Governor.
1691,MAYOR,1691,"Now, my old friend the Governor and
I understand each other perfectly."
1692,HARTMAN,1692,And so do I!
1693,MAYOR,1693,"So do you what, you hoodoo!"
1694,MAYOR,1694,"And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come
with us, we'll take you over to the
Warden's office and deliver this
reprieve."
1695,BURNS,1695,"Wait till those two future jailbirds
read the Morning Post tomorrow."
1696,HILDY,1696,How was that for a tight squeeze?
1697,BURNS,1697,Don't tell me you were worried!
1698,HILDY,1698,"Worried! I was petrified. Weren't
you?"
1699,BURNS,1699,"Uh-uh. As long as we were in there
together pitching -- they couldn't
lick us. Well, it's been a lot of
fun."
1700,HILDY,1700,In a way.
1701,BURNS,1701,"I mean -- working together. Just
like the old days. The things we've
been through, Hildy."
1702,HILDY,1702,"We've certainly been in some swell
jams."
1703,BURNS,1703,"Remember the time we broke into the
D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi
Randell's diary?"
1704,HILDY,1704,"Yeah. What about the time we hid the
missing heiress in the sauerkraut
factory? Six scoop interviews!"
1705,BURNS,1705,"Yeah - but that time we stole Old
Lady Haggerty's stomach off the
Coroner's physician. We proved she
was poisoned though, didn't we?"
1706,HILDY,1706,"We sure did, but we had to go in
hiding for a week."
1707,BURNS,1707,"In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only
chaperon was the poor old lady's
stomach."
1708,HILDY,1708,"Don't remind me. That's how we
happened to --"
1709,BURNS,1709,"Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be
making love to another man's fiancee."
1710,HILDY,1710,"That's all right, Walter. It's as
much my fault as yours."
1711,BURNS,1711,"Bruce is making the nine o'clock
train. I told him you'd be on it --
unless you want to write this story
yourself."
1712,HILDY,1712,"Well, if it's my last story, I'd
like it to be a good one. But -- I
guess I can't, Walter."
1713,BURNS,1713,"Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for
me to decide. Of course, you could
make a later train and still be in
Albany tomorrow morning."
1714,HILDY,1714,"Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --"
1715,BURNS,1715,"He's going to have you the rest of
his life, Hildy. Can't you give me
another hour?"
1716,HILDY,1716,"I don't know what to do, Walter."
1717,BURNS,1717,Flip a coin.
1718,HILDY,1718,All right.
1719,HILDY,1719,"Heads I go -- tails I stay to write
the story. Ready?"
1720,BURNS,1720,Ready.
1721,BURNS,1721,Well -- what is it?
1722,HILDY,1722,"What's the difference? I'm going to
write that story -- and you know it!"
1723,BURNS,1723,Hildy!
1724,HILDY,1724,"Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for
you!"
1725,BURNS,1725,Then why are you doing it?
1726,HILDY,1726,"Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven
help me!"
1727,BURNS,1727,"The greatest yarn ever written by
anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!"
1728,HILDY,1728,Thanks.
1729,BURNS,1729,"And what a way to quit. While you're
still champion! That's the way to
leave, Hildy!"
1730,HILDY,1730,"Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving,
Walter."
1731,BURNS,1731,"What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting
for you in Albany."
1732,HILDY,1732,"No, he won't. I wired him that I
wasn't coming."
1733,BURNS,1733,Where'd you wire him?
1734,HILDY,1734,"On the nine o'clock train. That's
the one he took, isn't it?"
1735,BURNS,1735,Sure.
1736,HILDY,1736,"It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs
a wife who can give him a home --
and affection -- and peace. I couldn't
do that for him, Walter. I'm what
you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd
give up her soul for a story!... Is
that job still open?"
1737,BURNS,1737,"Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper --
and being Mrs. Walter Burns."
1738,HILDY,1738,"Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We
tried it."
1739,BURNS,1739,"Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful!
Only you expected it to be like other
marriages. It can't be like other
marriages -- we're different! We're
a different world. Look at what we
went through today. I wouldn't trade
that for any honeymoon in the world.
I bet you wouldn't, either."
1740,HILDY,1740,"A fine honeymoon, with a murderer
right in the boudoir! And that other
honeymoon in a coal mine!"
1741,BURNS,1741,"That's what makes it romantic. Every
other married couple goes away on a
honeymoon and for two weeks the bride
knows just where the groom is, and
vice versa. But us -- you never know
where I am and I'm not sure where
you are. That's Romance!"
1742,HILDY,1742,"Well, maybe I'd like to know just
once!"
1743,BURNS,1743,"Hildy, if that's what you want, all
right. We'll even go to -- how about
Niagara Falls?"
1744,HILDY,1744,"Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't
mean that?"
1745,BURNS,1745,"Sure I do. And I'll tell you something
else -- I'd like a baby."
1746,HILDY,1746,Walter!
1747,BURNS,1747,"Sure, I can't last forever. I want a
son I can train to take my place on
this paper."
1748,HILDY,1748,"What would you do if it was a
daughter?"
1749,BURNS,1749,"Well, if she looked like you -- Say!
My brains and your looks -- that
mightn't be such a bad combination."
1750,HILDY,1750,What's the matter with my brains?
1751,BURNS,1751,"What's the good of arguing about
something that probably doesn't exist?
Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you.
What do you say?"
1752,HILDY,1752,"Well, I'd like to be lady-like and
think it over."
1753,BURNS,1753,"I don't want to rush you. Take a
couple of seconds."
1754,BURNS,1754,"Hello, Judge!"
1755,JUDGE,1755,"This is an outrage, Mr. Burns! Sending
a gunman to kidnap me!"
1756,BURNS,1756,"Now, wait a minute, Judge. This isn't
a kidnapping. You've got the legal
power to perform a marriage ceremony,
haven't you?"
1757,HILDY,1757,What!
1758,BURNS,1758,"Now don't argue, Hildy."
1759,BURNS,1759,"How about it, Judge?"
1760,JUDGE,1760,"Yes, but --"
1761,BURNS,1761,"Then go ahead. Come on, Hildy."
1762,HILDY,1762,"Nobody's going to rush me into
anything!"
1763,HILDY,1763,You keep away from me!
1764,LOUIE,1764,"All right, Judge."
1765,1ST REPORTER,1765,I'll be doggoned! A shotgun marriage!
1766,2ND REPORTER,1766,"Don't they usually keep the gun on
the man?"
1767,JUDGE,1767,""" -- so long as you both do live?"""
1768,BURNS,1768,I will.
1769,HILDY,1769,"That's what he said the last time.
Don't believe him, Judge."
1770,BURNS,1770,"Hildy, from this time on no tricks,
no double-crossing -- everything on
the level!"
1771,HILDY,1771,You're not fooling anybody.
1772,JUDGE,1772,"""Hildegarde Johnson, will you have
this man as your wedded husband, to
live together in the ordinances and
estate of Matrimony?"""
1773,HILDY,1773,"What would you do with a gun in your
back?"
1774,LOUIE,1774,Quiet!
1775,JUDGE,1775,"""Will you love him, comfort him,
honor and keep him in sickness or in
health; --"
1776,HILDY,1776,If I know where he is.
1777,JUDGE,1777,""" -- and, forsaking all others, keep
thee only unto him, so long as you
both do live?"""
1778,HILDY,1778,I will -- if he will.
1779,JUDGE,1779,Have you got a ring?
1780,BURNS,1780,How about Bruce's?
1781,HILDY,1781,"Walter, you can't do that!"
1782,BURNS,1782,"Sure, I can. Look at the policy I
gave him!"
1783,BURNS,1783,"""With this ring I thee wed and with
all my worldly goods I thee endow:
And thereto I plight thee my troth."""
1784,REPORTER,1784,"Say, I'm surprised she got the ring
back!"
1785,JUDGE,1785,""" -- pronounce you Man and Wife."""
1786,BURNS,1786,"Hildy, darling!"
1787,HILDY,1787,"Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a
fool. That's what I am. I know what
it's going to be like."
1788,BURNS,1788,It'll be Heaven!
1789,HILDY,1789,"Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought
up another coal mine to send me down
in -- to get a new story for your
paper!"
1790,HILDY,1790,Walter!
1791,HILDY,1791,"Counterfeit money! That's the money
you sent me, Walter! You -- you --"
1792,WALTER,1792,"But, Hildy, listen --"
1793,BURNS,1793,"But, Hildy -- I can explain --"
1794,HILDY,1794,You -- you!!
1795,LOUIE,1795,"I think it's going to work out all
right this time."
