0,ELI,0,"Dear Lord, thank you for your
generosity in providing us today
with this bountiful feast."
1,ELI,1,"Thank you for the many gifts that
you have given me. Thank you for
your protection and your guidance.
Thank you for bringing me this far.
I know my long journey's end is
near. I ask now only for the
strength and the courage to
complete the task that you in your
infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow
upon me over all men. I won't let
you down. Amen."
2,ELI,2,Hey. You hungry?
3,ELI,3,Come on now.
4,YOUNG WOMAN,4,"Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here,
take anything you want. You want
some food? Take it."
5,ELI,5,I'm not going to hurt you.
6,YOUNG WOMAN,6,That's what the last guys said.
7,ELI,7,Here.
8,YOUNG WOMAN,8,"Could you help me? The wheel came
off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I
could get it out of the ditch. But
I can't."
9,ELI,9,"One good thing about no soap any
more. You can smell the road agents
a mile off."
10,BANDIT LEADER,10,Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?
11,BANDIT LEADER,11,What you got there in the pack?
12,ELI,12,Nothing.
13,BANDIT LEADER,13,"Yeah, that's what they all say. How
about you take it off real slow and
tip it out so's we can take a look?"
14,BANDIT #2,14,He's got a gun.
15,BANDIT LEADER,15,"Shit, it ain't loaded. They never
are. Ain't that right, old man?"
16,BANDIT LEADER,16,Open the fucking pack or die.
17,ELI,17,I can't do that.
18,BANDIT LEADER,18,"Want us to do it for you? We can
get it off real easy after we've
hacked your fucking arms off."
19,ELI,19,"It's real important you boys listen
to me and understand. The man I
work for, you do not want to cross
him. See, I'm under his protection.
You stand in my way, you stand in
his. And he will cut you down with
a righteous fury - through me. For
I am his faithful instrument."
20,BANDIT LEADER,20,"What the hell are you, some kinda
preacher?"
21,ELI,21,Something like that.
22,BANDIT LEADER,22,"Well I got news for you, preacher
man. Whatever kinda God you reckon
yourself to be working for, he left
these parts a long time ago. He
ain't here to protect your ass. Now
take off the pack and set it on the
ground."
23,BANDIT LEADER,23,You fucking listening to me?
24,ELI,24,"I hear you. You lay that hand on me
again and you will not get it back."
25,BANDIT LEADER,25,"All right, I had just about enough
of this shit..."
26,BANDIT LEADER,26,"What... you just... he just cut my
fucking hand off! My fucking hand!"
27,BANDIT LEADER,27,"What you standin' around for? Kiss
him!"
28,BANDIT #3,28,"What's he talkin' about, kiss him?"
29,ELI,29,"He's in shock. He means ""kill him""."
30,ELI,30,"I told you you wouldn't be getting
that back."
31,BANDIT LEADER,31,Who are you?
32,ELI,32,My name is Eli.
33,ELI,33,"Take it and go on your way. And
don't fall in with men like these
again. No good can come."
34,YOUNG WOMAN,34,Why are you doing this?
35,ELI,35,"God, the father of mercies, through
the death and resurrection of his
son has reconciled the world to
himself and sent the holy spirit
among us for the forgiveness of
sins."
36,ELI,36,"Through the ministry of the church
may he give you pardon and peace,
and I absolve you from your sins in
the name of the father, and of the
son, and of the holy spirit. Amen."
37,YOUNG WOMAN,37,Thank you. You're... a good man.
38,ELI,38,There are no good men on the road.
39,YOUNG WOMAN,39,Where are you going?
40,ELI,40,West.
41,YOUNG WOMAN,41,Can... can I come with you?
42,ELI,42,No.
43,ELI,43,"It ain't your concern. Stay on the
path. It ain't your concern. Stay
on the path."
44,ELI,44,"You got an engineer or a fuelman
around here?"
45,ELI,45,Thanks.
46,CHAIN GANG BOSS,46,"Come on, move it!"
47,ENGINEER,47,I don't know you.
48,ELI,48,I'm not from around here.
49,ENGINEER,49,No shit. Who are you?
50,ELI,50,I'm just a customer.
51,ENGINEER,51,A customer with a shotgun?
52,ENGINEER,52,You come in here to rip me off?
53,ELI,53,No. I'll set it down. Okay?
54,ENGINEER,54,Slowly!
55,ENGINEER,55,"You carry a gun in the outland, you
don't bring one into town less you
live there. Don't you know that?"
56,ELI,56,"I'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on
the road a long time."
57,ENGINEER,57,Show me your hand.
58,ELI,58,I'm not a-
59,ENGINEER,59,I said show me your fucking hand!
60,ELI,60,I'm not one of them.
61,ENGINEER,61,What do you want?
62,ELI,62,"I'm just passing through. I need
some help. I can pay."
63,ENGINEER,63,"What kinda help? And what kinda
pay?"
64,ELI,64,"I'm going to get something out of
my pack. Okay?"
65,ELI,65,"I know, I know. Slowly."
66,ENGINEER,66,Holy shit.
67,ENGINEER,67,Where'd you find this?
68,ELI,68,"Years ago, in the outland back east
aways."
69,ENGINEER,69,Does it work?
70,ELI,70,"Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can
you do it? I got the cables."
71,ENGINEER,71,Depends if you also got the coin.
72,ENGINEER,72,"It'll take a couple hours. There's
a bar across the street you can
wait, they just opened up."
73,ELI,73,I'll wait here.
74,ENGINEER,74,You don't trust me?
75,ELI,75,I don't know you.
76,CARNEGIE,76,What is it?
77,REDRIDGE,77,"Survey team just finished up their
inspection. It ain't good."
78,CARNEGIE,78,How bad is it?
79,REDRIDGE,79,"Pressure is down again, and going
by the new rod they sank levels're
lower than they've ever been."
80,CARNEGIE,80,How long?
81,REDRIDGE,81,"Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A
little longer if we're careful. But
we're already-"
82,CARNEGIE,82,Halve the rations.
83,REDRIDGE,83,We just halved `em last-
84,CARNEGIE,84,So halve them again!
85,REDRIDGE,85,"You're going to have to say
something. Folks were none too
happy last time. Gonna be worse
now, you can count on it."
86,CARNEGIE,86,"I want you all to remember how far
we've come together. And how far we
still can go, if only we believe.
When I brought us here to this
oasis - this promised land - we
knew there would be hardships. Knew
there would be sacrifices. But we
also knew that we were creating for
ourselves a world where we could be
safe from the horrors of the
forsaken lands beyond our borders."
87,CARNEGIE,87,"And I want you all to remember
above all that it is not the water
with which we have been blessed
that is the true lifeblood of this
town... but faith."
88,CARNEGIE,88,"It is our faith that sustains us,
brothers and sisters! Hallelujah!"
89,CARNEGIE,89,"And mark me, the ultimate
validation of that faith is coming!
The sacred Word of Our Lord that
formed the world before and will
reform it once again is coming to
this town to bring it succor, bring
it nourishment, bring it new life!
For the Almighty Himself has spoken
unto me and promised it!"
90,CARNEGIE,90,"In the meantime, He has asked us
all to be patient. To walk the hard
road of the faithful just a little
longer. And to do that, we must
give just a little more."
91,CARNEGIE,91,"Water rations will be halved until
further notice."
92,CARNEGIE,92,"I understand your frustration. The
road to salvation is a difficult
one - but what lies at the end of
that road is a greater glory,
beyond anything you can imagine."
93,DISCONTENTED VILLAGER,93,"We've heard this all before! When
are you going to-"
94,CARNEGIE,94,"I know each and every one of you
will understand the necessity of
this action. It was faith that
built this town - and faith that
will sustain it even through the
dark times that may lie ahead. But
it is always darkest before dawn -
and the new dawn is coming."
95,CARNEGIE,95,May God go with you all.
96,REDRIDGE,96,"One of the road crews just rolled
into town."
97,CARNEGIE,97,"Of course they did, the bar's open.
Outlanders, always looking for
answers at the bottom of a bottle."
98,REDRIDGE,98,Not these guys.
99,REDRIDGE,99,These guys say they got something.
100,CARNEGIE,100,Get them up here now.
101,CARNEGIE,101,"Gentlemen! It's truly a delight to
see you again! I understand your
latest excursion into the outland
has been a profitable one?"
102,HOG,102,We did good.
103,CARNEGIE,103,"Well, let's see, shall we?"
104,CARNEGIE,104,No. No. No. No. No.
105,CARNEGIE,105,It's not here.
106,HOG,106,These ain't worth nothin'?
107,CARNEGIE,107,"When you bring me the book I asked
you for, it'll be worth something."
108,HOG,108,"We been doin' this a long time now.
Had to make a whole lotta corpses
to bring you all these books. You
want us to keep at it, reckon it's
worth more than a few free glasses
of that swill you call liquor."
109,CARNEGIE,109,"Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you
once again to take the long view
here. When we find this book - and
believe me, we will find it - we
are going to build a new world. A
world far greater, far more
righteous than this one. And you
and I are going to be perched right
on top of it, looking down upon it,
masters of all creation!"
110,CARNEGIE,110,"And you know, I think you're
absolutely right."
111,CARNEGIE (cont'd),111,"That is worth more than a few
glasses of liquor. A whole lot
more."
112,CARNEGIE,112,"The book I want is out there
somewhere, just waiting to be
found. Once there were millions of
copies - you only need to find one!
Find it and bring it here. And I
promise you, you will be rewarded
beyond anything you can imagine."
113,HOG,113,This better not be bullshit.
114,REDRIDGE,114,"Might help if they knew just what
they were looking for."
115,CARNEGIE,115,"Not one of them can read. How would
they even know when they found it?"
116,REDRIDGE,116,So how's about you just tell me?
117,REDRIDGE,117,"Two years now you been sending
these crews into the outland.
Burning up gas we can barely spare.
For a goddamn book? What the hell
kinda book can be worth all this?"
118,REDRIDGE,118,What about these?
119,CARNEGIE,119,Put them with the others.
120,ELI,120,"What's this place across the
street? They got any water?"
121,ENGINEER,121,"We got our own underground spring
here. Only fresh water in a hundred
miles - if's you can pay for it."
122,ELI,122,I'll be back.
123,ELI,123,"If that battery ain't here when I
get back, I will use this gun on
your kneecaps and I will put this
building to the torch and I will
watch it burn to the ground with
you alive inside it. So help me
God."
124,CLAUDIA,124,"Is that you, honey?"
125,CLAUDIA,125,Something wrong?
126,CARNEGIE,126,"More books came in from the road
today."
127,CLAUDIA,127,Oh? It's been a while.
128,CARNEGIE,128,"And it'll be a while longer. Just
another pile of useless junk. If we
don't find the right one soon - if
I can't give these people what they
want to hear..."
129,CLAUDIA,129,"You'll find what you're looking
for. It's out there somewhere. You
just have to have faith."
130,CARNEGIE,130,"Faith? Is that what you think we're
missing around here?"
131,CARNEGIE,131,"My old man used to have faith. He
had it in spades. My mother, too."
132,CARNEGIE (cont'd),132,"You know where it got them? You
know where it got me?"
133,CARNEGIE,133,"Faith is for the weak. It's for
them out there, the sheep. This
world is what you can see and touch
and taste. It's what you make it.
All these years with me, you still
don't have any grasp of that?
What's wrong with you, woman?"
134,CLAUDIA,134,I'm sorry.
135,CARNEGIE,135,"No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
scare you. Hey. You okay?"
136,CARNEGIE,136,"You just get me all riled up with
that kind of talk. It's not what I
need from you right now."
137,CARNEGIE,137,You know what I need right now?
138,BARTENDER,138,Outlander? Let me see-
139,BARTENDER,139,What'll it be?
140,ELI,140,Water.
141,BARTENDER,141,"That's the good stuff. Gotta eat
into my own ration to sell it - so
I don't sell it cheap."
142,BARTENDER,142,That'll get you maybe half-way.
143,BARTENDER,143,What about that?
144,ELI,144,That's the best I got.
145,BARTENDER,145,Solara!
146,BARTENDER,146,"Take this out back and get it
filled."
147,HOG,147,That was my cat.
148,ELI,148,Fine specimen.
149,HOG,149,I saw you push him off the bar.
150,ELI,150,I didn't push him.
151,HOG,151,You raised your hand at him.
152,ELI,152,Sorry. It won't happen again.
153,BARTENDER,153,"Hey, how about another drink, Hog?"
154,HOG,154,"That cat's been comin' in here for
nigh on two years. It got more
right to be here than you. Who the
fuck do you think you are?"
155,ELI,155,I don't want any trouble.
156,HOG,156,"Well, that's too bad, `cause-"
157,ELI,157,"I know you. Murderer of innocent
travelers on the road. You're going
to spend eternity drowning in a
lake of fire for the things that
you've done. Did you know that?"
158,ELI,158,"You go on back to your table and
I'll be on my way. All right?"
159,BURLY PATRON,159,"You push Hog, you push all of us."
160,ELI,160,"Cursed be the ground because of
you. By toil shall you eat of it.
Thorns and thistles shall it sprout
for you. From the ground were you
taken. For dust you are."
161,ELI,161,And to dust you shall return.
162,CARNEGIE,162,Did you hear that? What was that?
163,CLAUDIA,163,Maybe you should go check.
164,CARNEGIE,164,What in the hell is going on?
165,CARNEGIE,165,Get your asses out here!
166,SOLARA,166,Stop!
167,SOLARA,167,Please don't.
168,ELI,168,Go.
169,HOG,169,...What?
170,ELI,170,"It ain't for me to judge you. Your
time for that's gonna come. Believe
me. Now go on. Get out of here."
171,ELI,171,Thank you.
172,ELI,172,I'm sorry for all the mess.
173,CARNEGIE (O.S.),173,Hold it right there.
174,CARNEGIE,174,"So, who are you?"
175,ELI,175,Nobody. A walker in the outland.
176,CARNEGIE,176,"I've met walkers before. Not a
particularly civilized bunch. Some
have even taken to eating their own
kind, did you know that? You
wouldn't be one of those savages
now, would you?"
177,CARNEGIE GUNMAN,177,He ain't got the shakes.
178,CARNEGIE,178,"Good. This is a civilized town.
Under God. Do you know what that
means?"
179,CARNEGIE,179,"It means we have laws here. Laws
set down long before any of us ever
walked this earth. And one of them
is, you don't eat the flesh of your
brother. Else you're no better than
an animal. And not welcome here."
180,CARNEGIE,180,"So what's your business here,
friend? Walkers don't usually come
into town less they want something."
181,ELI,181,"I had a battery needed charging and
a canteen needed filling. I didn't
come here looking for trouble."
182,CARNEGIE,182,"Well, you sure as hell found it. Do
you know who I am?"
183,ELI,183,No.
184,CARNEGIE,184,"My name's Carnegie. I own this bar.
I own the whole town. You've never
heard of me?"
185,ELI,185,That's you out there on the street.
186,CARNEGIE,186,"Remarkable likeness, isn't it?
You'd never guess half the men who
built it were blind. A small
tribute from a grateful people. I
was deeply touched."
187,ELI,187,"You had slaves build you a monument
to yourself?"
188,CARNEGIE,188,"Don't call them slaves. That's an
old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm
trying to help these people."
189,CARNEGIE,189,"In the outland the sightless are
preyed upon like sick animals. Here
at least they're protected. They do
the essential work others don't
want. And in return they eat, they
drink, they survive. Last year, a
couple of them even got married -
performed the ceremony myself."
190,CARNEGIE,190,"You see, I'm not exploiting these
people - I'm saving them! Any one
of them is free to leave whenever
they wish. But here they stay. And
they thank me every single day for
their salvation!"
191,ELI,191,"It's none of my business what you
do here. Like you said, it's your
town. I just want to be on my way."
192,CARNEGIE,192,"What's your name, walker?"
193,CARNEGIE,193,"All right, I guess we just call you
Walker. Don't see too many folks
your age these days. You lived in
the world before? You can read?"
194,ELI,194,I read every day.
195,CARNEGIE,195,By who?
196,CARNEGIE,196,"All right, look. I'm going to make
you an offer of goodwill. Stay the
night, think it over. Try a little
local hospitality. We'll talk again
in the morning. If you're still not
interested, you're free to go. No
hard feelings."
197,ELI,197,"Thank you for your offer. But I'd
prefer to just leave right now. So
you can either let me out of here,
or I can kill my way out."
198,CARNEGIE,198,Let him go.
199,ENGINEER,199,"Oh, shit..."
200,ELI,200,How's my battery?
201,ENGINEER,201,"It's, uh... it's gonna take a
little longer than I thought."
202,ELI,202,How much longer?
203,ENGINEER,203,"It's gotta charge overnight. You,
uh, you can always stay here in
town, pick it up in the morning."
204,ELI,204,"You remember what I said would
happen if I came back here and you
didn't have my battery?"
205,ENGINEER,205,"It's right here! It's just gonna
take a while longer. I swear."
206,CARNEGIE,206,I knew you'd reconsider.
207,ELI,207,Yeah? How'd you know that?
208,CARNEGIE,208,"None of the walkers I've seen come
here from the outland were ever
what you'd call smart. I mean all
those years out there alone on the
road, some with their brains half-
fried from eating each other - it's
understandable why you people
aren't the brightest bulbs in the
box. But I never met one so dumb
that he'd turn down a meal and a
bed if it was offered."
209,ELI,209,"So you didn't send someone across
the street to the engineer?"
210,CARNEGIE,210,"Engineer? I don't know what you're
talking about. If there's something
wrong, maybe I can help."
211,CARNEGIE,211,"This is Redridge. He's kind of my
right-hand man around here."
212,CARNEGIE,212,He'll show you to your room.
213,REDRIDGE,213,"Enjoy your stay. There'll be
someone outside your room all
night. If you need anything."
214,ELI,214,Hello?
215,CLAUDIA,215,"I have this for you. Water for
washing and some food."
216,CLAUDIA,216,Well... are you going to take it?
217,ELI,217,Oh. Thank you.
218,CLAUDIA,218,You're very welcome.
219,CLAUDIA,219,It'll be dark soon.
220,CLAUDIA,220,Can I get you anything else?
221,ELI,221,"No, thank you."
222,CLAUDIA,222,Well. Have a good night.
223,ELI,223,You're Carnegie's woman?
224,CLAUDIA,224,Why do you ask?
225,ELI,225,"Just making conversation is all.
Haven't had one of those in a
while. Not a real one, leastways."
226,CLAUDIA,226,"He found me in the outland. I was
sixteen, my family had been...
well, they were gone. There was
just me and my baby."
227,ELI,227,You had a baby?
228,CLAUDIA,228,"I'd met some men on the road. Bad
men. They..."
229,ELI,229,It's all right.
230,CLAUDIA,230,"I was on the road for a year after
that. I couldn't feed myself, let
alone my little girl. And then Bill
found us and he promised he'd take
care of us. He told me he was going
to make a place where we could be
safe. And he did. He did all that.
He built this whole town. He kept
us safe. And he raised that child
like she was his own. He's been so
good to both of us. He saved us,
really."
231,ELI,231,You want to eat some?
232,ELI,232,"When did you go blind? In the war?
You get caught in a flash?"
233,CLAUDIA,233,"No, I was born this way. I think
I'm lucky like that."
234,ELI,234,Lucky?
235,CLAUDIA,235,"It's not like I ever knew what I'm
missing. I was already used to
being like this by the time... by
the time it all happened. So I got
around pretty good even when I was
on my own. And now it's easy. I
know every creaky old floorboard in
here, and it's not like I ever go
any place else. Bill would never
allow it. He worries about me so
much."
236,CLAUDIA,236,"I should go. He'll be wondering
where I am."
237,CLAUDIA,237,"Thank you. I enjoyed our
conversation."
238,ELI,238,So did I.
239,CARNEGIE,239,"You took your time in there. How
long does it take to deliver a
plate of food and some water?"
240,CLAUDIA,240,He wanted to talk.
241,CARNEGIE,241,Oh? What about?
242,CLAUDIA,242,"Nothing really. He asked me what it
was like to be blind."
243,CARNEGIE,243,He tell you anything about him?
244,CLAUDIA,244,"No. I don't think he likes to talk
about himself much."
245,CARNEGIE,245,"Yeah, I got that."
246,CLAUDIA,246,"I don't think he's going to change
his mind by morning. I don't think
he's going to stay."
247,CARNEGIE,247,What makes you say that?
248,CLAUDIA,248,"Just strikes me as the kind of man
who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't
seem like the type to go changing
it once it's set."
249,CARNEGIE,249,"Well, we'll just see about that."
250,CLAUDIA,250,"You saw him. He's not like the
others. You won't be able to smooth-
talk him and wrap him around your
finger like you usually do."
251,CARNEGIE,251,Who said anything about me?
252,CARNEGIE,252,I'm sending Solara.
253,CLAUDIA,253,You're doing what?
254,CARNEGIE,254,"You know how often these walkers
get laid? Never. Least not by
anything living or willing. Girl
like her can be very persuasive."
255,CLAUDIA,255,"You can't send her in there with
him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!"
256,CARNEGIE,256,You went in there readily enough.
257,CLAUDIA,257,"That's different. Solara's just a
child, she can't-"
258,CARNEGIE,258,"She's a grown woman now, Claudia.
Sooner or later you're going to
have to accept that. She has to
earn her keep around here, same as
the rest of us."
259,CLAUDIA,259,"By working as a whore? That's all
you think she's fit for?"
260,CARNEGIE,260,"We've each been given a talent to
help us make our way in this world.
Some people's gift is more evident
than others. Solara's sure as hell
is."
261,CLAUDIA,261,What kind of a man are you?
262,CARNEGIE,262,"I'm the kind of man who'd pull a
helpless blind girl off the road, a
girl who'd been beaten and raped,
and give her a place where she can
live without fear! Without me you'd
be just another no-eye, lying dead
in the outland, picked clean by the
buzzards, or shoveling dirt down
there with the others. That's the
kind of man I am!"
263,CLAUDIA,263,"I don't live without fear. I
haven't for a long time now."
264,CARNEGIE,264,Where are you going?
265,CLAUDIA,265,I'm not going to let you do this.
266,CARNEGIE,266,You're not going to let me?
267,CARNEGIE,267,"Nobody tells me what I can and
can't do in my own town. Nobody. I
built this world, and I am God
here! So don't go thinking about
screwing with my plans. You know
how this works. Solara goes against
me, you get hurt. You go against
me, she gets hurt."
268,CARNEGIE,268,"So let's not see anybody get hurt.
Okay?"
269,ELI,269,Come in.
270,SOLARA,270,Hi. Can I come in?
271,ELI,271,"Someone was already here with food
and water. I got everything I need."
272,SOLARA,272,You sure about that?
273,SOLARA,273,"It's too bright in here. Mind if I
turn it down a little?"
274,SOLARA,274,"That's better. I'm Solara. You're
Walker, right?"
275,ELI,275,No. My name's Eli.
276,SOLARA,276,That short for something? Elias?
277,ELI,277,Elijah.
278,SOLARA,278,"Elijah. I never heard that one
before. It's kinda cute."
279,ELI,279,"Look, I don't mean to be rude. But
I'm really not interested."
280,SOLARA,280,"You sure about that? It gets mighty
lonely out there on the road."
281,SOLARA,281,"If you're worried about money, this
is all paid for. The whole night."
282,ELI,282,"It's not that. You're a very nice
girl. But I'm not that kind of man."
283,SOLARA,283,They're all that kind of man.
284,ELI,284,I'm not.
285,SOLARA,285,"They told me you were crazy. Maybe
they were right."
286,ELI,286,I'm sorry. Good night.
287,SOLARA,287,"Please don't make me leave. I have
to stay the night. If I don't..."
288,ELI,288,"If you don't, what?"
289,SOLARA,289,He'll hurt my mom.
290,ELI,290,Who will? Carnegie?
291,ELI,291,Maybe he and I oughta have words.
292,SOLARA,292,"No! Please, don't!"
293,ELI,293,"He's hurting you. He's hurting your
mother. He's-"
294,SOLARA,294,He's my dad.
295,SOLARA,295,"Look, if you want to help me, just
let me stay here tonight. We don't
have to do anything. I'll sleep on
the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my
dad that we had a good time. I'll
be no trouble, I swear."
296,ELI,296,You want to have a conversation?
297,ELI,297,"You know, you don't have to be
afraid of me. What happened down
there in the bar..."
298,SOLARA,298,"I'm not afraid of you. I know you
didn't start that trouble. When I
first saw you, I knew you weren't
the type to go looking for it."
299,ELI,299,How'd you know that?
300,SOLARA,300,"My mom says I'm a good judge of
character. She says I can read
people. That I know a good man when
I see one."
301,SOLARA,301,"So... you're pretty old, right?"
302,SOLARA,302,"I'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't
seen too many people your age. How
old are you exactly?"
303,ELI,303,"You know, I don't rightly remember."
304,SOLARA,304,"But you're old enough. I mean, you
remember what it was like? In the
world before?"
305,SOLARA,305,What was it like?
306,ELI,306,Better than this.
307,ELI,307,"People lived longer back then.
Longer than me. Some were more than
a hundred years old."
308,SOLARA,308,Come on.
309,ELI,309,"I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's
not the same. If you're sick or
you're weak or you're old you won't
last long out on the road."
310,SOLARA,310,So how come you have?
311,ELI,311,Can I read you something?
312,SOLARA,312,Wait. You can read?
313,SOLARA,313,And you have a book?
314,ELI,314,Not just any book.
315,ELI,315,"The Lord is my shepherd. I shall
not want. He makes me lie down in
green pastures. He leads me beside
still waters. He restores my soul.
He leads me in the paths of
righteousness."
316,ELI,316,"Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear no
evil. For you are with me. Your rod
and your staff, they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me in
the presence of my enemies. You
anoint my head with oil. My cup
runs over. Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow me, all the days
of my life. And I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever."
317,SOLARA,317,"That's beautiful. Did you write
that?"
318,ELI,318,No.
319,SOLARA,319,What book is it from? Is it poetry?
320,ELI,320,"I guess you could think of it that
way. It's from the Holy Bible."
321,SOLARA,321,"I never heard of it. What's it
about?"
322,ELI,322,"It's about love, and forgiveness,
and life and death, and mercy, and
revenge, and the beginning and the
end of the world. I guess it's
about a little bit of everything."
323,SOLARA,323,Can I see?
324,SOLARA,324,What? I'm not going to do anything.
325,ELI,325,"I'm sorry. I'm charged to protect
this book. I can't trust it with
anyone. Not even for a while."
326,SOLARA,326,What's so special about that book?
327,ELI,327,"It's the last one. There are no
other books like this. All the
others are gone - destroyed by the
war or in the burnings that came
after. This is the only one that
survived until now. The last one
anywhere."
328,SOLARA,328,How can you know that?
329,ELI,329,I just know.
330,ELI,330,"For a long while after it happened,
I just wandered on the road like
most everybody else. There were
still a lot of people around back
then, in the beginning. I didn't
really know what I should do or
where I was going. I was just
moving from place to place, trying
to stay alive. And then one day I
heard this voice. I don't know how
to explain it, it's like it was
coming from inside me. But I could
hear it, clear as day. Clear as I
can hear you talking to me now."
331,SOLARA,331,What did it say?
332,ELI,332,"It led me to this place, I don't
really know where. And I found this
book buried deep under some rubble.
No way no-one was ever going to
find it if they didn't know exactly
where to look."
333,SOLARA,333,"But you knew because the voice told
you?"
334,ELI,334,"That's right. And that voice told
me to carry the book west."
335,ELI (cont'd),335,"It told me that a path would be
laid out before me, that I'd be led
to a place where this book would be
safe. It told me I'd be protected
against anyone or anything that
tried to stand in my way. If only I
would have faith."
336,ELI (cont'd),336,"That was twenty-five years ago. And
I've been walking ever since."
337,SOLARA,337,"Because a voice you heard in your
head told you to."
338,ELI,338,"I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it.
I know what I heard."
339,SOLARA,339,So who was it? The voice?
340,ELI,340,"A very important, very powerful
man."
341,SOLARA,341,More powerful than my dad?
342,ELI,342,"I should say so, yes."
343,SOLARA,343,Would you teach me to read?
344,ELI,344,What?
345,SOLARA,345,"I never learned. No-one around here
knows how. Only my dad, and he
won't teach me. I think he likes
being the only one who can read. I
think it makes him feel powerful."
346,ELI,346,I think you're probably right.
347,SOLARA,347,So would you teach me?
348,ELI,348,"I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow.
And I won't be back this way, ever."
349,ELI,349,Are you hungry?
350,SOLARA,350,I guess a little.
351,ELI,351,"There's some food on the table over
there. Let's eat."
352,ELI,352,"It's okay, it's okay. He's with me."
353,ELI,353,"Don't be afraid, pal. This is
Solara. She's our friend."
354,ELI,354,It's okay. It means he likes you.
355,SOLARA,355,It does?
356,ELI,356,"Trust me, if he didn't like you,
you'd know about it."
357,SOLARA,357,Did you really mean that?
358,ELI,358,Mean what?
359,SOLARA,359,That I'm your friend.
360,ELI,360,Sure.
361,ELI,361,"Our father, we thank you for this
meal which you have been so
gracious to place before us."
362,ELI,362,"We thank you for a warm bed and a
roof over our heads on a cold night
such as this."
363,ELI,363,"And we thank you for the gift of
friendship in these hard times."
364,ELI,364,Amen.
365,ELI,365,You say that last part too.
366,SOLARA,366,Amen. And now we eat?
367,ELI,367,And now we eat.
368,CARNEGIE,368,"Good morning, Solara."
369,CARNEGIE,369,"I said good morning, Solara."
370,SOLARA,370,"Morning, dad."
371,CARNEGIE,371,"How was your night? Did you sleep
well?"
372,SOLARA,372,"I did like you asked. Isn't that
what you really want to know? Just
come out and say it."
373,CARNEGIE,373,"You don't speak to your father like
that. When I ask you a civil
question, I expect a civil answer."
374,CARNEGIE,374,Did he say anything?
375,SOLARA,375,No. We didn't talk much.
376,CARNEGIE,376,"Well, do you think you managed to
change his mind about staying?"
377,SOLARA,377,I don't know. He said he had to go.
378,CARNEGIE,378,"So he did talk? What else did he
say? Come on, I want all of it!"
379,SOLARA,379,"That's all he said. That he was
going to be leaving this morning."
380,CARNEGIE,380,"We'll see. This is my town, nobody
leaves until I say they leave."
381,CLAUDIA,381,"Solara, honey, eat something."
382,SOLARA,382,"Our father, thank you for this meal
which you have been so gracious to
place before us."
383,SOLARA,383,"Thank you for my mother. Please
watch over her and keep her safe."
384,CARNEGIE,384,Solara...
385,SOLARA,385,Thank you for all the-
386,CARNEGIE,386,Solara!
387,CARNEGIE,387,What the hell are you doing?
388,CARNEGIE,388,"God didn't put this food on the
table. Do you hear me?"
389,CARNEGIE,389,Who put this food on the table?
390,CARNEGIE,390,"I said who put this food on the
table?"
391,SOLARA,391,You did.
392,CARNEGIE,392,Who taught you that?
393,SOLARA,393,Eli taught me.
394,CARNEGIE,394,Who the hell is Eli?
395,SOLARA,395,The walker. That's his name.
396,CARNEGIE,396,"And he taught you how to say those
words? How did he know them?"
397,SOLARA,397,He had them written down in a book.
398,CARNEGIE,398,What kind of a book?
399,SOLARA,399,"I don't remember! It was an old
leather book. It had kind of a...
thing on the front of it."
400,CARNEGIE,400,Show me.
401,CARNEGIE,401,He had a bible?
402,SOLARA,402,"That's what it was. A holy bible.
Daddy, what's wrong? Did I..."
403,REDRIDGE,403,"Something wrong, boss?"
404,CARNEGIE,404,"Something wrong? Something wrong?
The walker's gone!"
405,REDRIDGE,405,"That can't be. I had a man outside
his room the whole time."
406,CARNEGIE,406,"He jumped out the window, you
idiot! You didn't think to put a
man outside the fucking window?"
407,CARNEGIE,407,Find him. Now!
408,REDRIDGE,408,"Boss, he could be anywhere. He..."
409,REDRIDGE,409,"A battery. Didn't he say something
about a battery?"
410,CARNEGIE,410,Go! Go!
411,ELI,411,"It ain't your concern. Stay on the
path."
412,ELI,412,Dammit...
413,ELI,413,Let her go.
414,CARNEGIE,414,"That cannon of yours casts a pretty
wide net. I don't reckon you can
hit me without hitting her."
415,ELI,415,I reckon you're right.
416,ELI,416,"This, though? With this I'll shave
the hairs clean off your balls at a
hundred paces. You believe me?"
417,CARNEGIE,417,"I believe you. I have to say I'm
surprised to hear that language
coming from you, though. I mean,
you being a holy man and all."
418,CARNEGIE,418,"She told me all about it. Told me
all about the bible, too."
419,CARNEGIE,419,Can I see it?
420,ELI,420,No.
421,CARNEGIE,421,"You know, I've been searching for a
book like that one for years. All
I've ever wanted was to bring the
word of God to these poor
unfortunates here. To shine its
light upon them and give them
something in this wretched world
that they could believe in.
Something to live for! It's why I
built this town, did you know that?
All we've been missing is the word
to show us the way. And now, praise
the Lord, you've brought it to us."
422,CARNEGIE,422,"It's not right to keep that book
hidden away, all to yourself. The
word is meant to be shared with
others. It's meant to be spread!
Isn't that what you want? I could
help you do that. You and me, we
could do it together."
423,ELI,423,"The Lord himself told me that if I
carried this book west, one day I
would find the place where it was
needed. Where it would be safe.
Where it belonged."
424,ELI,424,But this ain't it.
425,ELI,425,Come on.
426,SOLARA,426,What? What is it?
427,ELI,427,"You shall not make for yourself any
graven image..."
428,ELI,428,Now we can go.
429,SOLARA,429,Where are we going?
430,ELI,430,"I told you where I'm going. You're
free to go wherever you want."
431,SOLARA,431,Wait... I'm not coming with you?
432,ELI,432,You're only going to slow me down.
433,SOLARA,433,"So what the hell was all that about
back there?"
434,ELI,434,"The man was hurting you. I don't
like that, so I put a stop to it.
Now you're free. He can't hurt you
any more."
435,ELI,435,No need to thank me.
436,SOLARA,436,"Thank you? For what? What am I
supposed to do now?"
437,ELI,437,"Whatever you want. That's what
being free is."
438,SOLARA,438,"Whatever I want. Except go with
you."
439,ELI,439,"I have to get where I'm going. I
can't be worrying about someone
else along the way."
440,SOLARA,440,I thought you were my friend.
441,ELI,441,"It's dangerous in the outland. I
wouldn't want you to get hurt."
442,SOLARA,442,"I'll be safe so long as I'm with
you. I know it."
443,ELI,443,"You don't want this life. I gotta
do what I gotta do. Don't have no
choice in it. But you do. And I
can't let you choose this. You
don't want to be like me. You don't
want to spend your life alone."
444,SOLARA,444,"If I came with you, I wouldn't be
alone. And neither would you."
445,ELI,445,"I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best
you just go on back to town."
446,SOLARA,446,"Fine! I'll do just that! I had a
life there! A family! I didn't ask
you to save me! I didn't ask you
for anything!"
447,SOLARA,447,Fine.
448,CARNEGIE,448,"Thank you, darling."
449,REDRIDGE,449,"He killed four of my men and walked
out of town without a scratch. They
shot off a hundred rounds at him
and he didn't get hit once. I never
even heard of anything like that."
450,CARNEGIE,450,"You know, I always thought of
myself as a shepherd. Bringing
together the wayward and the lost.
Tending to my flock. But all the
things I want to do, I can't do
them on my own. The one thing I've
needed is the one thing that's
always been missing. Then one day
it walks right into town - so close
I can almost touch it - and then
walks right on out again."
451,CARNEGIE,451,"I want you to put a crew together
and go out after him."
452,REDRIDGE,452,"He's not going to work for you. I
think he's made that plain."
453,CARNEGIE,453,"I'm not interested in him any more.
I only want the book he's carrying."
454,REDRIDGE,454,"If I'm gonna risk my ass hunting
down this maniac in the outland, I
need to know it's gonna be worth
it. I need to know what's so
special about this goddamn book."
455,CARNEGIE,455,"You have no idea. You're too young,
you don't remember the world
before. But I do. I remember."
456,CARNEGIE,456,"When I was a kid my parents used to
read that book every goddamn day.
My mother, she'd read it along with
this smooth-talking preacher on the
TV screen. They used to be able to
beam these guys right into your
house, into every house in the
world, through the air. Like magic."
457,CARNEGIE,457,"She worked two jobs and she sent
every spare penny she had to that
fucking guy on the TV. My old man,
he'd read that book, then he'd get
liquored up and kick my ass, tell
me all about the power and the
glory and how I was going to burn
forever in hell for the sins I was
born with. He made sure he beat it
into me good."
458,CARNEGIE,458,"Don't you see? It's not just any
book."
459,CARNEGIE (cont'd),459,"It has the power to motivate
people. It can give them hope, it
can terrify them. It can shape
them. Control them."
460,CARNEGIE (cont'd),460,"Do you remember how I built this
town? It wasn't done with force,
and it wasn't done just with water.
It was done with the power of
words. I created this place out of
nothing, because people believed in
a promise that I sold to them.
Those guys on the TV, they were
richer than you could ever dream,
and it was all built the same way.
With words. With promises. And with
that book."
461,CARNEGIE (cont'd),461,"That book is a weapon. Aimed right
at the hearts and minds of the weak
and the desperate. Just imagine
what I could do with it."
462,REDRIDGE,462,"Boss... we're running out of water
and the people are running out of
patience. You're trying to tell me
that a book is going to keep them
in line?"
463,CARNEGIE,463,"Oh, it'll do much more than that.
The water in this town may run dry,
but faith - that springs eternal!
And that faith will help turn this
town into a city. And this city
into a nation. It will help me
build a new world. In my image.
People will come from far and wide
to hear what's inside of it.
They'll follow me anywhere just to
get a taste of it. And they'll do
whatever I tell them."
464,REDRIDGE,464,"And what if this book don't work?
What if it don't say what you want
it to say?"
465,CARNEGIE,465,"Oh, it'll say what I want, I can
promise you that. Because I'm going
to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts
that work for me and make the rest
whatever I need it to be."
466,CARNEGIE,466,"A new bible, for a new world."
467,CARNEGIE,467,"What do you think, darling? A whole
new world, to do with as we will.
Won't that be grand?"
468,CARNEGIE,468,Find that book.
469,REDRIDGE,469,He has half a day on us already.
470,CARNEGIE,470,So use the motor pool.
471,REDRIDGE,471,There ain't much gas in reserve.
472,CARNEGIE,472,"Whatever there is, use it."
473,CLAUDIA,473,What about Solara?
474,CLAUDIA,474,She's still out there. With him.
475,CARNEGIE,475,"Right. Right. Of course. Bring her
back, too, if you can. But-"
476,REDRIDGE,476,The book. I know.
477,SOLARA,477,Shit. Shit.
478,SOLARA,478,Where the hell am I?
479,FEMALE VOICE (O.S.),479,Hello?
480,FEMALE VOICE (O.S.),480,Hello? Can anyone help me?
481,SLUMPED FEMALE,481,Hello? Is anybody there?
482,SOLARA,482,Are you all right?
483,YOUNG WOMAN,483,"Oh. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You
go along, I'll be okay."
484,SOLARA,484,You look like you need some help.
485,YOUNG WOMAN,485,"No, really! I'm fine. Really... I
need a man to help. Not you. You
just keep along. Please."
486,SOLARA,486,It'll just take a minute.
487,YOUNG WOMAN,487,"Really, it's fine! Please!"
488,YOUNG WOMAN,488,Let her go! She ain't got nothing!
489,BRIGAND LEADER,489,I ain't too sure about that.
490,YOUNG WOMAN,490,This wasn't the deal!
491,BRIGAND LEADER,491,"Shut your mouth, bitch. You oughta
be grateful you're getting a break."
492,BRIGAND LEADER,492,"Never did care much for that dried-
up old snatch anyhow."
493,BRIGAND LEADER,493,"This one, though... this one looks
fresh. You a virgin?"
494,BRIGAND LEADER,494,"Well, let's find out."
495,ELI,495,"I offer you both one final chance
in this life to seek forgiveness
for your sins so that your souls
may find salvation. Will you say
with me the act of contrition?"
496,BRIGAND LEADER,496,Fuck you.
497,ELI,497,"Some might think it'd be most
fitting to leave you here like
this. Let you die slow in the sun.
But I know better. I know where
you're going. And the sooner you
get there, the sooner you'll get
what's coming to you."
498,RIFLE BANDIT,498,Wait!
499,RIFLE BANDIT,499,"I want to say it. I want to be
forgiven."
500,ELI,500,"Repeat after me. Oh God, I am
heartily sorry for having offended
thee, and I detest all my sins."
501,ELI,501,"I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins, and
do penance, and to amend my life.
Amen."
502,RIFLE BANDIT,502,Amen...
503,SOLARA,503,You came back for me.
504,ELI,504,What are friends for?
505,ELI,505,"This is the deal. You keep up. You
pull your weight. You fall behind,
I can't help you. Okay?"
506,SOLARA,506,Okay.
507,SOLARA,507,What about her?
508,ELI,508,"There's nothing can be done for
her."
509,SOLARA,509,"You killed it! That cute little
thing!"
510,ELI,510,"It's good eating, is what it is."
511,SOLARA,511,That's not funny.
512,ELI,512,"If you're going to be on the road,
you can't be picky about what you
eat. You eat what's there to eat."
513,SOLARA,513,I'm not eating that.
514,ELI,514,More for me.
515,ELI,515,"Father, we thank you for your
generosity in providing us with
this meal. Bless this food to our
use and us to thy service, and keep
us ever mindful of the needs of
others. Amen."
516,SOLARA,516,What does that taste like?
517,ELI,517,Tastes like chicken.
518,SOLARA,518,What is that?
519,ELI,519,It's a Saint Christopher medal.
520,SOLARA,520,"Who's Saint Christopher? Is he a
character from your book?"
521,ELI,521,"Christopher was a man who lived a
long time ago. He wanted to be a
good man, he wanted to help people.
So he would stand by a river that
had no bridge and carry people
across. He was a big strong man and
there was no one he couldn't carry."
522,ELI,522,"Then one day a young child came to
the river and asked to be carried
across. Christopher tried to carry
him but he was too heavy. He was
just a small boy but he was heavier
than any man he had ever carried.
The boy explained that he was the
son of God, and that he was so
heavy because he bore all the sins
of the world. After that,
Christopher was able to carry him
across and when they got to the
other side the boy baptized him in
the river. And that's how he became
a saint. Later on, he was known as
the patron saint of travelers."
523,SOLARA,523,"What is a saint, anyway?"
524,ELI,524,"It's someone who spent their life
doing good things for others.
Enough that God himself took a
special interest in them."
525,SOLARA,525,Someone like you.
526,ELI,526,"No. Not like me. Saints ain't
killers. And I done too much of
that. Spilled too much blood."
527,SOLARA,527,"Will you read me some more from the
book?"
528,ELI,528,"It's late. You should get some
sleep. Maybe tomorrow."
529,SOLARA,529,Eli?
530,ELI,530,What are you doing?
531,SOLARA,531,"You scared me! I thought you were
asleep."
532,ELI,532,"On the road you sleep with one eye
open. I asked you what you were
doing."
533,SOLARA,533,I just wanted to see the book.
534,ELI,534,"You want to see the book, you ask
me. Nobody touches it but me. Ever.
Until it gets where it's going. Do
you understand?"
535,ELI,535,Tell me you understand!
536,SOLARA,536,Okay! I understand! Ow!
537,ELI,537,"It's no use to you anyway. You
don't know how to read it."
538,SOLARA,538,"Well... now we have the time, maybe
you can teach me."
539,ELI,539,Maybe. Get some sleep.
540,REDRIDGE,540,He's been here.
541,REDRIDGE,541,The girl's with him.
542,REDRIDGE,542,Move out!
543,REDRIDGE,543,I said move out!
544,CARNEGIE GUNMAN,544,"I heard this guy's protected
somehow, some... power from up
above. That there ain't nothing on
this earth can touch him."
545,REDRIDGE,545,"He's just a man. You put a bullet
in him, he'll go down like any
other. I don't want to hear no more
of this superstitious horseshit!"
546,SOLARA,546,"You say you've been walking for
twenty-five years. Have you ever
considered that you might be lost?"
547,ELI,547,No.
548,SOLARA,548,"But how can you know? How can you
know this is the right way?"
549,ELI,549,"I told you. My path has been laid
out before me."
550,SOLARA,550,"Yeah, but laid out by who?"
551,ELI,551,By Almighty God.
552,SOLARA,552,"Well if this God guy's so mighty,
how come it's taking you so long to
get where you're going? Doesn't he
know the way?"
553,ELI,553,"You want to stay on this road with
me, don't ever let me hear you take
his name in vain like that again."
554,SOLARA,554,Sorry.
555,ELI,555,"God has a reason for everything
being the way it is. It's not
always apparent to us. But it is
his plan nonetheless."
556,SOLARA,556,"So, is he talking to you right now?
Telling you where to go?"
557,ELI,557,"It's not like that. It's kinda hard
to explain. I'm guided by faith."
558,SOLARA,558,I don't know what that word means.
559,ELI,559,"It means you know something even
though you don't know it."
560,SOLARA,560,That doesn't make any sense at all.
561,ELI,561,It doesn't have to.
562,SOLARA,562,"I don't get it. It looks almost...
normal. Like nothing ever happened.
How can it still be out here?"
563,ELI,563,I don't know.
564,SOLARA,564,"Maybe we should look inside. There
might be food."
565,ELI,565,Stay behind me.
566,SOLARA,566,This is weird.
567,ELI,567,Yeah.
568,ELI,568,Shit.
569,SOLARA,569,What?
570,ELDERLY MAN,570,Who are you?
571,ELI,571,"My name is Eli. This is Solara.
We're travelers, that's all. We
don't mean you any harm."
572,ELDERLY MAN,572,"You cut my padlock. I saw you.
Trying to break into our house."
573,ELI,573,"I'm sorry. We didn't think anybody
lived here. We thought it was
abandoned, like all the rest."
574,ELDERLY MAN,574,"Take a look around you. Look at
this yard. Does it look abandoned
to you?"
575,ELI,575,"No, sir. I... like what you've done
with the place."
576,ELDERLY MAN,576,What's your business here?
577,ELI,577,"No business. We're sorry to have
troubled you. If you'll let us down
we'll happily be on our way."
578,ELDERLY WOMAN,578,"George, look at them! They're not
robbers or road agents! One of
them's just a girl!"
579,ELDERLY MAN,579,"Seen that before. Oldest trick in
the book."
580,ELDERLY WOMAN,580,"Oh, stop! It's no trick. Let them
down!"
581,ELDERLY WOMAN,581,"I'm so sorry about my husband. We
so rarely get visitors these days,
he's suspicious of everybody."
582,ELDERLY WOMAN,582,"I'm Martha and this is my husband
George. Would you care for some
tea?"
583,MARTHA,583,"I'm afraid we don't have any cake
or biscuits for the tea. They ran
out some time ago."
584,MARTHA,584,Please.
585,MARTHA,585,How do you like it?
586,ELI,586,It's.. uh...
587,SOLARA,587,It's very good.
588,ELI,588,Have you always lived here?
589,MARTHA,589,"For almost forty years now. This
home is our pride and joy, isn't
it, George?"
590,MARTHA,590,"We refused to leave, even during
the troubles. We said, didn't we
George, we said if we're going to
die anywhere, we're going to die
right here, in our own home."
591,ELI,591,"I don't understand how you've
survived out here this long."
592,MARTHA,592,"Well, George is something of a
handyman, aren't you, dear? He did
a lot of work on the place, making
it safe. We may be old, but we're
resilient. We've had more than a
few who've tried to take this place
from us. Haven't we, George?"
593,GEORGE,593,Yes. Yes we have.
594,SOLARA,594,Are these... graves?
595,MARTHA,595,"Of course. It would be uncivilized
not to bury them. We're not
barbarians."
596,GEORGE,596,"Plus, it's good for the soil."
597,MARTHA,597,"Come on back inside. I think I
might be able to rustle up some
sandwiches."
598,ELI,598,We have to get out of here.
599,SOLARA,599,"They look so sweet... I would never
have believed they were killers."
600,ELI,600,They're worse than that.
601,SOLARA,601,What?
602,ELI,602,They didn't just kill these people.
603,ELI,603,They ate them.
604,SOLARA,604,They what?
605,ELI,605,"There's a disease in the outland.
Spread by eating human meat. It
affects the brain. Dementia, loss
of motor function. Did you notice
the old woman's hands shaking?
She's got it. They've both got it."
606,SOLARA,606,Oh my God...
607,MARTHA (O.S.),607,"I found some meat for those
sandwiches! Are you hungry?"
608,SOLARA,608,No! Thank you!
609,ELI,609,We really must be going.
610,GEORGE,610,So soon?
611,ELI,611,"Yes, I'm afraid so."
612,MARTHA,612,Are you sure you won't stay?
613,ELI,613,Yes. Thank you again for the tea.
614,SOLARA,614,Oh no... it's my dad. It's his men.
615,ELI,615,Are you sure?
616,SOLARA,616,I recognize the cars.
617,ELI,617,Back inside.
618,GEORGE,618,What did you bring upon us?
619,MARTHA,619,George? What's wrong?
620,GEORGE,620,"A whole convoy of armed
degenerates, that's what's wrong!
Coming here for them! And they led
them right to us!"
621,MARTHA,621,Oh no they don't...
622,GEORGE,622,"Martha, what are you doing?"
623,MARTHA,623,"I finally got this house just the
way I want it. I'm not going to let
anybody tear it apart!"
624,SOLARA,624,Where did you get all this stuff?
625,GEORGE,625,"Took `em off them who came looking
to take the place from us. Built up
quite the stash over the years."
626,GEORGE,626,You know how to fire a gun?
627,SOLARA,627,My daddy showed me once.
628,GEORGE,628,Just like riding a bike.
629,SOLARA,629,I never rode a bike.
630,GEORGE,630,"How about you, you know how to-"
631,GEORGE,631,Never mind.
632,REDRIDGE,632,"We know you're in there! Come on
out with your hands up and your
weapons on the deck and nobody
needs to get hurt."
633,REDRIDGE,633,"All right, look. I'm gonna make it
easy on y'all. Bring out the girl
with the book."
634,REDRIDGE (O.S.),634,"That's all we want. The girl and
the book. The rest of you's can go
your way."
635,SOLARA,635,What are we going to do?
636,ELI,636,Hand me my pack.
637,CARNEGIE GUNMAN #2,637,They ain't comin' out. They-
638,REDRIDGE,638,Holy shi...
639,REDRIDGE,639,Get down! Everybody get down!
640,REDRIDGE,640,"Damn you, return fire!"
641,MARTHA,641,"Come and get it, you god-damn sons
of mother-fucking bitches!"
642,ELI,642,"It's all right. We're going to be
all right. Trust me."
643,ELI,643,"You remember what I told you about
faith?"
644,ELI,644,"We're going to get out of this
alive. Both of us. I know."
645,SOLARA,645,Because God told you?
646,ELI,646,Because God told me.
647,GEORGE,647,What about us?
648,ELI,648,He didn't mention you.
649,GEORGE,649,Martha? Martha!
650,REDRIDGE,650,We got any more of those RPGs?
651,CARNEGIE GUNMAN #3,651,That was it.
652,REDRIDGE,652,Screw this.
653,REDRIDGE,653,Get clear!
654,ELI,654,Solara?
655,SOLARA (O.S.),655,Eli!
656,ELI,656,Are you all right?
657,SOLARA,657,I'm fine.
658,SOLARA,658,Oh God...
659,ELI,659,"Come on. We're going out the back.
We're running."
660,REDRIDGE,660,"Go ahead and try it, holy man. You
ain't that fast."
661,REDRIDGE,661,Where's the book?
662,REDRIDGE,662,I ain't playing.
663,REDRIDGE,663,Check the pack.
664,CARNEGIE GUNMAN #4,664,It ain't here.
665,REDRIDGE,665,It's gotta be.
666,REDRIDGE,666,"Hello, what have we here?"
667,REDRIDGE,667,Fuck! Get it off! Get it off me!
668,REDRIDGE,668,"If you don't got the book, what
fucking use are you?"
669,SOLARA,669,Wait!
670,SOLARA,670,"It's here! I've got it! Please
don't kill him."
671,ELI,671,Solara...
672,SOLARA,672,"It's just a book, Eli. No book is
worth giving up your life for."
673,ELI,673,You're wrong.
674,REDRIDGE,674,"You did good, sweetheart. Your
daddy would be proud. He knew you'd
come through for him."
675,SOLARA,675,"He said he would hurt my mom. If I
didn't help him."
676,REDRIDGE,676,Daddy's little girl...
677,SOLARA,677,I want you to let him go.
678,REDRIDGE,678,What?
679,SOLARA,679,"You've got what you came for. You
don't need him. Let him go."
680,REDRIDGE,680,He's killed a dozen of my men.
681,SOLARA,681,"If you hurt him, I'm not coming
back with you. You'll have to drag
me kicking and screaming."
682,REDRIDGE,682,Take your shit and get out of here.
683,REDRIDGE,683,No weapons.
684,ELI,684,"I told you we'd both live. Now do
you have faith?"
685,DRIVER,685,What the hell...?
686,REDRIDGE,686,"Stop, stop!"
687,REDRIDGE,687,Shit. Turn around!
688,DRIVER,688,We ain't got the gas for it!
689,REDRIDGE,689,She's getting away!
690,DRIVER,690,"We got the book! And we got barely
enough gas to make it back as it
is! We can't go chasin' her!"
691,REDRIDGE,691,Stupid little bitch...
692,REDRIDGE,692,Drive on.
693,SOLARA,693,"Come on, come on..."
694,SOLARA,694,No... No!
695,SOLARA,695,Eli! Eli!
696,SOLARA,696,Eli...
697,ELI,697,Thought you'd gone back to town.
698,SOLARA,698,"I can't go back there. Eli, I'm so
sorry."
699,ELI,699,For what?
700,SOLARA,700,"For what? I betrayed you! I gave
them the book!"
701,ELI,701,"You did what you believed you had
to."
702,SOLARA,702,You're not mad at me?
703,ELI,703,I forgive you.
704,SOLARA,704,"Here. I thought you might still
need this."
705,ELI,705,Thank you.
706,SOLARA,706,What are you going to do now?
707,ELI,707,Same as always. Keep heading west.
708,SOLARA,708,"Why? I mean, you don't have the
book any more."
709,ELI,709,But I still have my faith.
710,SOLARA,710,What's that?
711,ELI,711,"It's grass. It used to grow all
over the place."
712,SOLARA,712,How come it's here?
713,ELI,713,"I don't know. Less poison in the
air this near to the ocean, maybe."
714,SOLARA,714,What's wrong?
715,ELI,715,Nothing. Just a cramp.
716,SOLARA,716,What?
717,ELI,717,Do you smell that?
718,SOLARA,718,Smell what?
719,ELI,719,"Salt in the air. We're close to the
ocean. We're almost there."
720,ELI,720,Come on.
721,ELI,721,"Watch your footing. Step where I
step."
722,SOLARA,722,This... this is the world before?
723,ELI,723,What's left of it.
724,ELI,724,Do you see that?
725,SOLARA,725,I see it. Is that it?
726,ELI,726,That's it.
727,VOICE (O.S.),727,Who goes there?
728,ALCATRAZ GUARD,728,Identify yourselves!
729,ELI,729,"My name is Elijah Stone. I have a
message for your boss. I need you
to tell him that I have a King
James Bible in my possession."
730,ALCATRAZ GUARD,730,"Remain where you are! Do not
attempt to move or you will be
fired upon!"
731,ALCATRAZ GUARD,731,"Be prepared to surrender any
weapons at the gate!"
732,SOLDIER,732,They're clean.
733,THIN MAN,733,"Welcome, both of you. I'm Professor
Lombardi. I'm the curator here."
734,ELI,734,Elijah Stone.
735,SOLARA,735,Solara.
736,LOMBARDI,736,"Solara. What a delightful name. Is
that by any chance Shakespearean?"
737,SOLARA,737,"I, uh, I think it's Japanese."
738,LOMBARDI,738,Wonderful.
739,LOMBARDI,739,"Is it true what they tell me? You
have a King James Version?"
740,ELI,740,"Been carrying it with me for twenty-
five years."
741,LOMBARDI,741,"My goodness. I can't tell you how
exciting this is. Well, come, come!"
742,LOMBARDI (cont'd),742,"I'll give you the nickel tour and
then we can all sit down and take a
look at it."
743,LOMBARDI,743,"Yes, we've been doing this for some
time now. Collected over thirty
thousand volumes from generous
donors all across the nation. We
even have a printing press that we
hope to have operational soon."
744,SOLARA,744,"You turned the whole prison into a
library?"
745,LOMBARDI,745,"Well, not exactly. We're more like
a storage facility. We're holding
these books here in trust, if you
like. When society gets back on its
feet and no longer needs us to
preserve these volumes, they'll be
here waiting."
746,LOMBARDI,746,"I must ask you, how did you hear
about us? We've been doing
everything we can to get the word
out, but we always like to know
where our benefactors come from."
747,ELI,747,I was sent here by God.
748,LOMBARDI,748,"Is that right? Well, it's good to
know we're getting such high-
profile referrals these days."
749,LOMBARDI,749,"I must say, I am so excited that we
finally have a King James. You
know, we have a Talmud here, we
have two Korans, we even have that
Scientology book. But never a
Christian bible, until now. I
honestly believed it was the one
book I'd never see again, after
what happened..."
750,LOMBARDI,750,May I ask what condition it's in?
751,ELI,751,"It's a little beat-up. But it'll do
the job."
752,LOMBARDI,752,"Well, then. What say we take a look
at it?"
753,ELI,753,Is there someplace we could sit?
754,LOMBARDI,754,Of course. Right this way.
755,CARNEGIE,755,Did you get it?
756,CARNEGIE,756,Show me.
757,CARNEGIE,757,The new world begins here...
758,CARNEGIE,758,What the fuck is this?
759,ELI,759,"Do you have something you can write
with?"
760,LOMBARDI,760,"Mmm? Oh, yes of course!"
761,LOMBARDI,761,"Could you please bring us some
writing paper?"
762,ELI,762,Bring a lot of it.
763,REDRIDGE,763,What? What is it?
764,ELI,764,Are you ready?
765,LOMBARDI,765,What exactly am I writing?
766,ELI,766,"Pay close attention and write down
every word exactly as I say it."
767,ELI,767,"The First Book of Moses called
Genesis. Chapter one, verse one. In
the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth. Verse two.
The earth was without form, and
void; and darkness was on the face
of the deep. And the spirit of God
was hovering over the face of the
waters. Verse three. And God said,
""Let there be light,"" and there was
light."
768,CLAUDIA,768,What's wrong?
769,CARNEGIE,769,"You told me once that you know how
to read this. This blind language."
770,CLAUDIA,770,"Well, a long time ago, when I was a
little girl..."
771,CARNEGIE,771,"You're going to read it for me.
Every word. And I'm going to write
it down. Start at the beginning."
772,CLAUDIA,772,"I'm sorry. It's been so long. I
don't remember. I don't remember
any of it."
773,CARNEGIE,773,God fucking dammit!
774,CLAUDIA,774,"Bill, is there something-"
775,CARNEGIE,775,Just go. Just get out of my sight.
776,ELI (V.O.),776,"Dear Lord, thank you for giving me
the strength and the conviction to
complete the task you entrusted to
me. Thank you for guiding me
