0,TRACY (VO),0,"None of this would have happened if Mr.
McAllister hadn't meddled the way he
did.  He should have just accepted
things as they are instead of trying to
interfere with destiny.  You see, you
can't interfere with destiny.  That's
why it's destiny.  And if you try to
interfere, the same thing's going to
happen anyway, and you'll just suffer."
1,JIM,1,"Morning, Lowell"
2,JIM,2,Twenty-one... twenty-two.
3,"MOTHER
(distant)",3,Good luck!
4,TRACY,4,"Good morning, Mr. McAllister."
5,JIM,5,"Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?"
6,"TRACY
(chirping)",6,"You know what they say about the early
bird."
7,JIM,7,"Yes, I do."
8,JIM,8,"Well, good luck there, Tracy"
9,TRACY,9,"Thanks, Mr. M."
10,TRACY (VO),10,"No matter what he says, Mr. McAllister
had it out for me from the start.  Oh
sure, he was all smiles and good wishes
and everything, but underneath he was
just as unfair and petty as anybody
else."
11,TRACY (VO CONT'D),11,"He'll probably tell you how committed
he was to teaching and democracy and
integrity and all. Don't be fooled."
12,JIM (VO),12,"It's hard to remember how the whole
thing started, the whole election mess.
What I do remember is that I loved my
job. I was a teacher, an educator, and I
couldn't imagine doing anything else."
13,VOICE (OS),13,"Hey, Mr. M. Mr. M.!"
14,PAUL,14,Stop daydreaming! Get back to work!
15,JIM (VO),15,"The students knew it wasn't just a job
for me."
16,JIM,16,"C'mon, wolverines!  Defense!  Let's
hold 'em back!"
17,JIM (VO),17,I got involved. And I cared.
18,JIM (VO CONT'D),18,And I think I made a difference.
19,JIM (VO CONT'D),19,"I knew I touched the students' lives
during their difficult young adult
years, and I took that responsibility
seriously."
20,JIM (VO CONT'D),20,"In the twelve years I taught U.S.
History, Civics and current Events at
Millard, I was voted Teacher of the Year
three times - a school record."
21,JIM (VO CONT'D),21,"Standing in front of a room full of
young people, trying to make them think
that's how I wanted to spend the rest
of my life,"
22,JIM,22,"So would this be an ethical situation
or a moral situation? What's the
difference between ethics and morals,
anyway?"
23,JIM (CONT'D),23,Anybody
24,JIM (CONT'D),24,Derek
25,DEREK,25,"Uh, ethics is like when you, uh, do
what society tells you is right and
morals are like, uh..."
26,JIM,26,"You're on the right track,  who can
help him out?"
27,DEREK,27,..morals are when...
28,JIM,28,Michelle?
29,MICHELLE,29,"Morals are like lessons, you know, like
the moral of a story; it's what you
learn from a story or a fable or
something. . ."
30,JIM,30,"Or a life experience.  Good.  And
ethics?"
31,MICHELLE,31,"That's more like, urn... Ethics is how
you use the morals... that you learn
from a story?"
32,JIM,32,"Okay.  But we're still missing
something key here.  What are we
missing?"
33,"TRACY
(hand still raised)",33,I know.
34,"JIM
(finally)",34,Tracy.
35,TRACY,35,Ethics are...
36,JIM (VO),36,"Tracy Flick.  Tracy Flick.  I've never
met anyone quite like Tracy Flick."
37,JIM (VO CONT'D),37,"She first showed up in my life as a
freshman delegate in student council.
I'd seen a lot of ambitious students
come and go over the years, but I could
tell right away Tracy Flick was
different."
38,JIM (VO CONT'D),38,"It wasn't long before everyone knew who
Tracy Flick was.  She made sure of that.
Her drive was astonishing.  Even scary."
39,TRACY (VO CONT'D),39,"Some people say I'm an overachiever,
but I think they're just jealous."
40,TRACY (VO CONT'D),40,"My Mom always tells me I'm different --
you know, special. And if you look at
all the things I've accomplished so far,
I think you'd have to agree."
41,TRACY (VO CONT'D),41,Here I am in Oklahoma.
42,"TRACY
(off-key)",42,I'm just a girl who can't say no...
43,TRACY (VO),43,"And here I am on KMHS, our student-run
TV station."
44,TRACY (ON TV),44,"..that's why Principal Hendricks made
the controversial announcement that the
littering must stop.  Tracy Flick
reporting."
45,TRACY (VO),45,"But it was in SGA, the Student
Government Association, where I made my
biggest mark.  I never missed a meeting,
and I volunteered for every committee as
long as I could lead it."
46,TRACY,46,"I agree with Ashley.  We should rent
the barrels at least a day beforehand.
What happened last time was a travesty,
I mean, we were --"
47,"LARRY FOUCH
(trying to quiet
her)",47,"Yeah, no, I know, Tracy.  That's why
we're -- Look, can we just take a vote
on this?"
48,JIM (VO),48,"Now at the end of her junior year,
Tracy was poised to win the presidency
of the student body.  And so far she was
running unopposed."
49,TRACY,49,"...the rules of conduct determined by a
culture at a..."
50,JIM (VO),50,"Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy
I think you should know."
51,DAVE,51,"Her pussy gets so wet you can't believe
it."
52,JIM (VO),52,"A few months before the election, she'd
had an affair with my best friend Dave
Novotny."
53,JIM,53,"Don't tell me that.  I don't want to
know that."
54,DAVE,54,"She's incredible.  Everything just gets
soaked."
55,JIM (VO),55,"Dave came to Millard the year after I
did, and we hit it off right away. We
backed each other up in teachers'
meetings and shared an interest in 60's
music and micro-breweries."
56,JIM (VO CONT'D),56,"You could tell Dave was one of those
guys who taught because they never
wanted to leave high school in the first
place, and that could get a little
irritating sometimes, but basically he
was a real good guy."
57,"DAVE
(singing)",57,"Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a
cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You
know you're a sweet little love maker..."
58,JIM (VO),58,"Our wives became best friends too. And
when Dave and Sherry's son Darryl was
born, they asked us to be godparents."
59,TRACY (VO CONT'D),59,"YOU probably think the worst - that Mr.
Novotny was just taking advantage of one
of his students, but it wasn't like that
at all. Our relationship was based on
mutual respect and admiration. I mean,
during my sophomore year in geometry it
was strictly professional between us --
I mean, nothing."
60,TRACY (VO CONT'D),60,"It wasn't until junior year when we
worked together on the yearbook that
things got serious."
61,TRACY (VO CONT'D),61,"One night he took us editors out to
celebrate after a deadline. Eventually
Dave and I were left alone and we got to
talking - not like teacher and student,
but like two adults."
62,DAVE,62,"You know, Tracy... I don't know how to
say this, but..."
63,TRACY,63,what?
64,DAVE,64,"Well, I notice you don't seem to have
any close friends at Millard. You seem
to be kind of a loner."
65,TRACY,65,"No, I'm not. I'm just really busy."
66,DAVE,66,"I know.  I know its not by choice.  I
just mean, well, being the kind of
person you are, it must be really
difficult to find someone you can talk
to."
67,TRACY,67,"What do you mean? What kind of person
am I?"
68,DAVE,68,What kind of person?
69,DAVE (CONT'D),69,"Tracy, I've been watching you for going
on two years now, and I think you are
one of the most talented, hard-working,
sensitive, attractive, brilliant
students -- no, human beings -- I have
ever met.  I mean, you're the real
thing.  Special."
70,"TRACY
(embarrassed, low)",70,Thank you.
71,DAVE,71,"And I know sometimes people like you
have to pay a price for their greatness,
and that price is loneliness."
72,DAVE (CONT'D),72,"I don't know.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But it
seems like you might need a friend."
73,TRACY (VO),73,"Since I grew up without a dad, you
might assume psychologically I was
looking for a father figure."
74,TRACY (VO CONT'D),74,"But that had nothing to do with it at
all.  It was just that Dave was so
strong and made me feel so safe and
protected."
75,TRACY (VO CONT'D),75,"It was the first time somebody ever saw
the real me, the me that nobody else
knows."
76,"DAVE
(looking around)",76,"Here, get down."
77,DAVE,77,Look at you.
78,TRACY (VO),78,"When I think back on my relationship
with Mr. Novotny, what I miss most. is
our talks."
79,JIM,79,"You did it at your house?  Your own
house?"
80,DAVE,80,"Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all
seems crazy, and maybe it did start out,
you know, for the... for the sex and the
danger.  But now it's different.  Jim,
what I'm trying to tell you is that
Tracy and I are totally, totally in
love."
81,JIM,81,In love?
82,DAVE,82,"Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she
inspires me in ways Sherry never has.
She even wants to read my novel."
83,JIM,83,But you haven't written your novel.
84,DAVE,84,"That's the whole point. It's all in my
head; it's right here.  I just got to
get it out there. Tracy wants me to
write it so she can read it.  It's
beautiful."
85,JIM,85,"Dave, I'm just saying this as your
friend.  What you're doing is really,
really wrong, and you've got to stop."
86,DAVE,86,"You're not just jealous, are you?  I
mean, we both used to talk about her"
87,"JIM
(exploding)",87,"That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What
are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all
the time, but it doesn't mean anything.
I would never. . . I mean, I take very
seriously our strict moral code.  The
line you've crossed is... it's illegal
and it's immoral."
88,DAVE,88,"I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim,
okay?  I know what --"
89,JIM,89,"I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm
talking about morals."
90,SHERRY (OS),90,Peek-a-boo!
91,"DAVE
(to Jim,
whispering)",91,"Look, I appreciate your concern. I
really do.  But like I said, I got it
under control."
92,JIM (VO),92,"I guess I don't have to tell you how
all this turned out."
93,DAVE,93,Tracy's Mom -- she doesn't understand.
94,WALT,94,"No, I'd say she doesn't.  I don't think
I've ever seen a mother quite so upset.
We're all very, very lucky she doesn't
want this public."
95,DAVE,95,But we're in love
96,WALT,96,"Dave. Dave, look at me"
97,WALT,97,I want you to get some help.
98,JIM (VO),98,"After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him
out of the house and filed for divorce."
99,SHERRY,99,Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
100,DAVE,100,Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
101,JIM (VO),101,"He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to
live with his parents. I haven't heard
from him in a long time. Poor guy. I
warned him."
102,TRACY,102,...certain time in history and
103,JIM,103,Okay.  We'll pick up here next time
104,TRACY (VO),104,"Now that I have more life experience, I
feel sorry for Mr. McAllister."
105,TRACY (VO),105,"I mean, anyone who's stuck in the same
little room saying the exact same things
year after year for his whole life,
wearing the same stupid clothes, while
his students go on to good colleges and
move to big cities and do great things
and make loads of money has got to be at
least a little jealous.  It's like my
room says - the weak always try to
sabotage the strong."
106,TRACY (VO CONT'D),106,"One thing that's important to know
about me is that I'm an only child.  So
my Mom is really devoted to me, and I
love her so much.  She wants me to do
all the things she wanted to do in life
but couldn't."
107,TRACY (VO CONT'D),107,"See, Mom used to be a stewardess for
Northwest and now works as a para-legal.
She likes to write letters to successful
women like Janet Reno and Elizabeth Dole
and ask them how they got to be where
they are and what advice do they have
for me, Tracy, her daughter."
108,TRACY (VO CONT'D),108,"Nine times out of ten they say you have
to hold on to your dreams no matter
what.  The pressures women face mean you
have to work twice as hard, and you
can't let anything or anyone stand in
your way."
109,TRACY,109,One per person!  Put those back I
110,DOUG SCHENKEN,110,Eat me
111,TRACY,111,Ninety-seven.. .ninety-eight.
112,TRACY (VO),112,"But you know,  winning isn't
everything.  If you play fair and follow
all the rules thoroughly, you'll always
come out ahead.  Win or lose, ethical
conduct is the most important thing.
Just ask Mr. McAllister."
113,TRACY,113,"Mr. McAllister? Mr. McAllister! Wait up
I"
114,TRACY,114,"I got all my signatures.  One hundred
and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!"
115,JIM,115,"Hey, that's super"
116,TRACY,116,Here they are.
117,JIM,117,"You can put those in my box.  I'll look
at them tomorrow."
118,TRACY,118,"Could you approve them now?  I'd like
to kick off my campaign right away, you
know, in the morning."
119,"JIM
(resigned)",119,Right
120,JIM (CONT'D),120,Looks good to me.
121,TRACY,121,Aren't you supposed to keep them?
122,JIM,122,"NO, that's fine"
123,TRACY,123,"I thought you were supposed to keep
them."
124,JIM,124,"Okay, fine. Sure"
125,TRACY,125,Thanks for everything.
126,JIM,126,You bet.
127,"TRACY
(cheery, awkward)",127,I can't wait to start campaigning.
128,JIM,128,Should be easy.  So far no competition.
129,TRACY,129,"Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's
number one soft drink, but they spend
more money than anybody on advertising.
I guess that's how come they stay number
one."
130,JIM,130,"Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy"
131,TRACY,131,"You know, Mr. M., when I win the
presidency, that means you and I are
going to be spending a lot of time
together next year.  And I for one would
like that time to be harmonious and
productive. Wouldn't you?"
132,JIM,132,Sure
133,TRACY,133,"Okay. That's good. I just wanted to
make sure."
134,JIM,134,"Good luck, Tracy."
135,JIM (VO),135,"I don't blame Tracy for what happened
with Dave. How could I? Dave was an
adult more than twice her age."
136,JIM (VO CONT'D),136,"Sure, she got on my nerves once in a
while, but I admired Tracy. I really
did."
137,JIM (VO CONT'D),137,"Thank God for Diane.  She was my best
friend, my source of love and strength.
Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy
times, but we'd always seen them
through.  After nine years of marriage,
we were closer than ever.  And the
secret? Good communication."
138,DIANE,138,Anything wrong?
139,JIM,139,"Everything's fine.  Just, you know,
school."
140,TRACY'S VOICE,140,"...You know, Coca-Cola's by far the
number one soft drink... When I win the
presidency we're going to be spending a
lot of time together... a lot of time...
lots and lots and lots of time...
president and advisor. . ."
141,TRACY,141,"...harmonious and productive... close
and special... you and I...  so close...
so intimate... together..."
142,"JIM
(quietly)",142,Paul.
143,PAUL,143,Why. . . ? Why. . . ?
144,PAUL (VO),144,"I was so mad at God when I broke my leg
at Shadow Ridge over Christmas break."
145,PAUL (VO CONT'D),145,"The doctors told me I'd have to quit
sports for at least a couple years if
not forever."
146,PAUL (VO CONT'D),146,"...which meant no first-string
quarterback in the fall. It was like the
end of my life!"
147,PAUL (VO CONT'D),147,"When I got back to school everybody was
so supportive, and they all wanted to
sign my cast and everything..."
148,PAUL (VO CONT'D),148,"... but I still couldn't shake the
feeling that now my life had no purpose.
What did God want from me?"
149,PAUL (VO CONT'D),149,Why did I exist?
150,PAUL (VO CONT'D),150,"Sometimes you can search everywhere for
answers. Then one day destiny just taps
you on the shoulder. I know, because it
happened to me."
151,JIM,151,"Paul, could I talk to you for a minute?"
152,PAUL (VO),152,"Mr. McAllister changed my life. And no
matter what they say he did or did not
do, I believe he is a good man."
153,JIM,153,"Paul, I know you've been pretty down
since your accident."
154,PAUL,154,"I wanted to play next year so bad I
could taste it.  And maybe go on to..."
155,JIM,155,"I know.  I understand disappointment.
I really do."
156,PAUL,156,Yeah.
157,JIM,157,"But you've got a big choice right now.
You can choose to be depressed about it
for the rest of your life. Or you can
choose to see it for what it really is:
an opportunity.  I personally think you
have a big future ahead of you, and I
don't mean the fleeting glory of sports."
158,PAUL,158,What do you mean?
159,JIM,159,"Let me give you a clue.  You're a born
leader.  You're one of the most popular
students at Millard.  You're honest and
straightforward.  You don't choke under
pressure, as we all saw in that amazing
fourth quarter against Westside.  The
other kids look up to you.  What does
that spell?"
160,JIM,160,Student... council... president.
161,PAUL,161,"Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't
know anything about that stuff, Mr. M.
Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing.
She's always working so hard and --"
162,JIM,162,"Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right."
163,PAUL,163,And she's super-nice
164,JIM,164,"Yeah.  But one person assured of
victory kind of undermines the whole
idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's
more like a... well, like a
dictatorship, like we studied."
165,JIM,165,"Paul, what's your favorite fruit?"
166,PAUL,166,Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
167,JIM,167,"takes a piece of chalk from the lip of
the blackboard."
168,JIM,168,"Okay, let's say"
169,PAUL,169,"No, wait -- apples.  Apples."
170,JIM,170,"Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was
apples.  Apples, apples and more apples.
You might think apples were pretty good,
even if you occasionally got a rotten
one. Then one day there's an orange. And
now you can make a decision. Do you want
an apple, or do you want an orange?
That's democracy."
171,PAUL,171,I also like bananas.
172,JIM,172,"Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe
it's time to give a little something
back."
173,TRACY,173,"The right side is too high. The right
side. Just a smidge."
174,"GUY
(signing)",174,"Hey Paul, you going over to Anthony's
on Friday, or what did you decide?"
175,PAUL,175,I gotta talk to him first.
176,TRACY,176,Who put you up to this?
177,PAUL,177,"Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy"
178,TRACY,178,Who put you up to this?
179,PAUL,179,What do you mean?
180,TRACY,180,"You just woke up this morning and
suddenly decided to run for president?"
181,PAUL,181,"No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just
thought --"
182,TRACY,182,Thought what?
183,PAUL,183,"Well, see, I was talking to Mr.
McAllister about my leg and
everything... and how I still want to,
you know, do something for the school
and --"
184,TRACY,184,So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
185,PAUL,185,"Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him
and everything, but he just said he
thought it was a good idea... and how
there's all different kinds of fruit
and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy.
You're the best.  I just thought --"
186,TRACY,186,"Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on."
187,TRACY (VO),187,"You might think it upset me that Paul
Metzier had decided to run against me,
but nothing could be further from the
truth.  He was no competition for me: it
was like apples and oranges. It just
meant I had to work a little harder,
that's all."
188,TRACY (VO CONT'D),188,"You see, I believe in the voters. They
understand that elections aren't just
popularity contests. They know this
country was built by people just like me
who work very hard and don't have
everything handed to them on a silver
spoon."
189,TRACY (VO CONT'D),189,"Not like some rich kids who everybody
likes because their fathers own Metzier
Cement and give them trucks on their
sixteenth birthday and throw them big
parties all the time.  They don't ever
have to work for anything."
190,TRACY (VO CONT'D),190,"They think they can all of a sudden one
day out of the blue waltz right in with
no qualifications whatsoever and try to
take away what other people have worked
for very, very hard their entire lives.
No, it didn't bother me at all I"
191,PAUL,191,"Paul... Paul... power... Paul... Paul
for President... progress... promise...
peanut... Paul-i-tics... yeah...
President Paul... Punt for Paul!  No."
192,"TAMMY
(softly)",192,What?
193,LISA,193,"I told you ... I can't. I just -- It
doesn't feel right anymore, you know?"
194,TAMMY,194,If you could just get out of your head.
195,LISA,195,I said no!
196,PAUL,196,"Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today."
197,TAMMY,197,Don't you fucking knock?
198,PAUL,198,"Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr.
McAllister, he --"
199,(noticing Lisa),199,Oh hi. Lisa.
200,TAMMY,200,"Paul, get out!"
201,PAUL,201,So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
202,LISA,202,I gotta go.
203,"TAMMY
(to Paul)",203,You dumbshit!
204,PAUL,204,What'd I do?
205,TAMMY (VO),205,"You know how they say one day a big
meteor might come and crash into the
Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think
that would be a good thing."
206,TAMMY,206,Lisa
207,TAMMY,207,Stop! Wait!
208,TAMMY (CONT'D),208,Where 're you going?
209,LISA,209,I'm not like you.
210,TAMMY,210,What...?
211,LISA,211,"I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in
love. We were just... I was just
experimenting."
212,TAMMY (VO),212,"How can something that seems so true
turn out to be such a lie?"
213,TAMMY (VO CONT'D),213,"I mean Lisa and I were destined to be
together. It was so obvious. Of all the
people on the planet who had ever lived,
somehow we'd found each other."
214,TAMMY (VO CONT'D),214,Lisa...
215,TAMMY (VO CONT'D),215,"I remember one time Lisa and I did an
experiment with asparagus to see how
long it takes your pee to smell. We peed
a little every five minutes."
216,TAMMY (VO CONT'D),216,"For her it took about fifteen minutes,
and for me it was twenty."
217,TAMMY (VO),217,"Everyday I found some new way to tell
Lisa I loved her."
218,"NOTE
(Tammy's voice)",218,"If you died right now, I would throw
myself into one of my Dad's cement
trucks and get poured into your tomb."
219,TAMMY (VO),219,"But it just seemed like the closer we
got, the more she pulled away."
220,LISA,220,Are you crazy?
221,TAMMY,221,What?
222,LISA,222,People can see this.
223,TAMMY,223,So?
224,LISA,224,These are private -- these are for us.
225,TAMMY,225,I know.
226,LISA,226,But other people can see them too.
227,TAMMY,227,I don't care.
228,LISA,228,"Well, I do."
229,TAMMY (VO),229,"What did I do to make her change?
What's wrong with me?"
230,"TAMMY (VO CONT'D)
(a whisper)",230,Lisa.
231,TAMMY (VO CONT'D),231,"Sometimes when I'm sad, I sit and watch
the power station."
232,TAMMY (VO CONT'D),232,"They say if you lie between two of the
main wires, your body just evaporates.
You become a gas.  I wonder what that
would feel like."
233,TAMMY (VO CONT'D),233,"I don ' t know what I did to make Lisa
hate me so much, but somehow she decided
to hurt roe. And she knew exactly what
to do."
234,PAUL (VO),234,"I sure was surprised the day Lisa
Flanagan asked me for a ride home and
ended up blowing me."
235,LISA,235,I've wanted this for so long.
236,PAUL,236,Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
237,LISA,237,Sorry.
238,PAUL (VO),238,"Life is so weird.  First Lisa has a big
fight with my sister, and the next thing
you know she's my girlfriend."
239,PAUL (VO CONT'D),239,"Since Lisa knew all about public
relations and stuff, she offered to help
me with my campaign.  We made a great
team!"
240,PAUL (VO CONT'D),240,"It seemed so natural, the two of us
together.  It was like destiny."
241,PAUL (VO CONT'D),241,"That spring was perfect.  My leg wasn't
bugging me too much, and the weather was
so nice.  And every afternoon after
school. Lisa and I would go to her house
to fuck and have a swim.  It was like we
were in a world all our own."
242,TAMMY (VO),242,"I had to do something.  I didn't know
what, but I had to do something."
243,JIM (VO),243,"Around that time Diane and I were
hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's
house, giving her our love and support
and helping her make it through a
difficult time."
244,DIANE,244,"Jim, don't.  You're scaring him."
245,JIM,245,He likes it.
246,DIANE,246,Here.  Give him to me.
247,"(as she takes
Darryl)",247,"is little Darryl dizzy?  That's it. .
come here. . ."
248,SHERRY,248,You got him?
249,DIANE,249,Yeah.
250,JIM (VO),250,"Diane really wanted to have kids -- and
so did I -- but it seemed like there was
always a reason to wait: she had to
finish nursing school, I had to get my
masters, we needed a new house, we
needed more money.  Finally we just
decided to go for it..."
251,JIM (VO),251,"...but for over a year we hadn't had
any luck.  And Diane was getting
desperate."
252,DIANE,252,You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
253,JIM,253,"Yeah, uh, just a minute"
254,DIANE,254,"Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come
on, fill me up"
255,JIM,255,"Yeah, just --"
256,DIANE,256,Do it!
257,DIANE (CONT'D),257,Okay!
258,DIANE,258,Could you hand me the remote?
259,SHERRY,259,"Say, Jim. Jim."
260,SHERRY (CONT'D),260,Could you get this? I can't
261,JIM,261,Sure.
262,JIM (VO),262,"Without Dave around. Sherry needed a
lot of help around the house."
263,JIM,263,Here?
264,"SHERRY
(indicating)",264,More this way.
265,JIM,265,Okay.  Give me the drill.
266,JIM,266,"I'd always liked Sherry, but we'd never
had a chance to spend any time alone
together.  How with Dave out of the
picture, I began to see what an
incredibly sensitive and giving person
she was."
267,JIM (VO CONT'D),267,"Plus she had finally dropped all that
weight from her pregnancy, and really
she looked great."
268,JIM (VO),268,"We got to be pretty good buddies.  I
even took her to the mall one time while
her car was in the shop."
269,SHERRY,269,What do you think?
270,JIM,270,You look great
271,SHERRY,271,I can't afford this stuff right now.
272,JIM,272,"Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year,
you're cooped up with the kid all the
time.  Let go; live a little."
273,SHERRY,273,You sure?
274,JIM,274,"So what do you think?  Should we get a
room?"
275,SHERRY,275,Should we get a what?
276,JIM,276,points at the motel.
277,SHERRY (CONT'D),277,Oh.
278,"SHERRY (CONT'D)
(stiffly)",278,That's not funny.
279,DIANE,279,How'd it go?
280,JIM,280,"Fine. You know. We just went to
Crossroads."
281,DIANE,281,You guys have fun?
282,"JIM
(between bites)",282,"Yeah. No. I mean, you know."
283,DIANE,283,What?
284,JIM,284,"Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a
little much sometimes."
285,DIANE,285,"Oh, Jim! Oh, God!"
286,DIANE/SHERRY,286,"Oh, God.  Just like that.  Oh yes. Fill
me up..."
287,DIANE/TRACY,287,"Do it, Jim.  Fuck me."
288,TRACY (OS),288,"Fuck me, Mr. McAllister"
289,JIM (VO),289,"So like I was saying, things were going
pretty well in my life."
290,JIM (VO),290,"... that is, until things started going
all haywire with that damn election."
291,PAUL,291,"Tammy? Tammy, what are you doing?"
292,TRACY,292,"You're the advisor.  You should stop
her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a
sophomore."
293,JIM,293,"Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down."
294,TRACY,294,"Are you sure all her signatures are
real?  It's not easy to get all those
signatures."
295,JIM,295,"As far as I know, they--"
296,PAUL,296,"We can't both run, can we?  We're
brother and sister.  Can we?"
297,LISA,297,"It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul
was first."
298,JIM,298,"Anyone who gets signatures in on time
can run.  And she got in just under the
wire.  Nothing I can do."
299,TRACY,299,Let me see them.  Let me see them
300,TRACY,300,"These are a bunch of burn-outs. And
look at this one, I can't even read this
one."
301,"JIM
(taking the sheet)",301,Looks like Tim Kobza.
302,LISA,302,She's doing this to get back at me
303,PAUL,303,For what?
304,LISA,304,I mean at you.
305,PAUL,305,For what?
306,LISA,306,"I don't know.  You're her brother you
should know."
307,TRACY,307,"Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've
never heard of him!"
308,JIM,308,"Look, why don't we just forget about
Tammy?  We'll have the assembly
tomorrow, everybody'll make their
speeches, and I'm sure everything will
be fine."
309,JERRY,309,"I love Millard High, and I will be a
dedicated vice President. A vote for
Jerry Slavin is a vote for good
government. And even if I can't really
stand up for you, I will."
310,(cracks himself up),310,Thank you.
311,JIM,311,"Thank you, Jerry, and good luck. Again,
Jerry is running unopposed for Vice
President. So we'll move on now to the
presidential race with three candidates
running. The first in alphabetical order
is Tracy Flick."
312,TRACY,312,"Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, ""I
cannot make my days longer, so I strive
to make them better.""  With this
election, we here at Millard also have
an opportunity to make our high school
days better.  During this campaign I
have had the opportunity to speak with
many of you about your concerns.  I
spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who
told me how alienated she feels from her
own homeroom.  I spoke with sophomore
Reggie Banks, who said his mother works
in a cafeteria and can't afford to buy
him enough spiral notebooks for his
classes.  I won't bore you with long-
winded promises about all the new and
innovative things I will definitely
achieve during the year in which it will
be my honor and privilege to represent
each and every one of you, but I can say
that my years of experience on the
student council have taught me the three
most important attributes the president
needs to possess;  commitment -"
313,DOUG SCHENKEN,313,Eat me
314,DOUG'S BUDDY,314,Eat me raw!
315,WALT,315,"If you can't be adults and give these
candidates the courtesy they deserve,
then you don't deserve to be called
adults but children* Because that's what
children are. And you'll be treated like
children. So let's all listen up."
316,TRACY,316,"The three most important attributes the
president needs to possess are:
commitment, qualifications, and
experience.  I'll add one more; caring.
I care about Millard, and I care about
each and every one of you, and together
we can all make a difference.  One of
the things I would like to establish is
a regular open forum where any student
can come and voice their concern about
issues we face here at Millard.  I and
the rest of the student council would
then interface with the faculty and
staff, so a continuous dialogue would
exist."
317,WALT,317,"I'd say she knows a thing or two about
student-faculty dialogue."
318,TRACY,318,"When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick
next week, you won't just be voting for
me.  You'll be voting for yourself and
for every other student Our days won't
be any longer, but they can sure be
better.  Thank you."
319,JIM,319,"The next candidate for student body
president is Paul Metzier.  Paul?"
320,PAUL,320,"As many of you know I broke my leg
pretty bad thi3 year and the experience
has made me reevaluate what I want to do
with my life and that is help people
when you think about it a school is more
than a school it's our second home where
we spend all cur time and grow as
individuals and a community but is our
school everything it could be I want our
school to reach its true potential that
is why I am running for president."
321,PAUL,321,"I know what it is to fight hard and win
like when we almost went to state last
fall and I threw that fourth-quarter
pass against Westside for the touchdown
that won the game by three points I
won't let you down like I didn't then I
promise we can all score a winning"
322,(big breath),322,"touchdown together. Vote Paul Metzier
for president thank you."
323,JIM,323,"Okay, Paul. Now our final candidate for
President - another one of the Metzier
clan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier."
324,WALT,324,People.  People I
325,TAMMY,325,Who cares about this stupid election?
326,TAMMY (CONT'D),326,"We all know it doesn't matter who gets
elected president of Millard. You think
it's going to change anything around
here, make one single person happier or
smarter or nicer? The only person it
matters to is the one who gets elected.
The same pathetic charade happens every
year, and everyone makes the same
pathetic promises just so they can put
it on their transcripts to get into
college.  So vote for me, because I
don't even want to go to college, and I
don't care, and as president I won't do
anything.  The only promise I make is
that if elected I will immediately
dismantle the student government, so
that none of us will ever have to sit
through one of these stupid assemblies
again!"
327,STUDENTS,327,Tammy!   Tammy!  Tammy!
328,TAMMY,328,"0h don't vote for me I  Who cares?
Don't vote at all!"
329,WALT,329,"That little bitch made a fool of us I
want her out of the election. Getting
everybody all riled up like that.  She's
finished, you hear me? Washed up."
330,JIM,330,"Walt, we can't throw her out of the
election just because we don't like her
speech.  That's not what student
government's about."
331,"WALT
(grumbling)",331,"Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's
a troublemaker.  She's on my list."
332,RON,332,"All we need to do is send a message, so
maybe we should just suspend her."
333,WALT,333,"Right.  That's it.  She's suspended for
a week!"
334,JIM,334,"I think that's a little strong Walt.
Ron?"
335,RON,335,"We don't want to make a martyr out of
her.  Three days sounds right to me."
336,WALT,336,Okay.  Three days.  Take care of it.
337,TAMMY (VO),337,"Being suspended is like getting a paid
vacation.  Too bad it was only three
days"
338,DUDE,338,Here you go.
339,TAMMY,339,Hey -- I said lights I
340,TAMMY,340,What do you want?
341,PAUL,341,"Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know,
I went to all your teachers and got your
assignments."
342,PAUL (CONT'D),342,"I just thought, well, last time you got
suspended you fell so behind and -"
343,TAMMY,343,"Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot."
344,TAMMY (CONT'D),344,Now could you leave me alone?
345,PAUL,345,"Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You
know, all this election stuff. 'Cause,
you know, everyone is saying it's so
weird that you're running against me,
and, well, it is kind of weird, and you
haven't really told me why you're doing
it and didn't tell me in advance or
anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l
respect your privacy.  I just want you
to know that no matter who wins, if it's
you or me, there's no hard feelings.
We're still brother and sister.  Okay?
Cause... and I hope you feel the same."
346,TAMMY,346,"Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings."
347,PAUL,347,Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
348,PAUL,348,"Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Right.  One other
thing.  Since you know Lisa so well,
could you give me some advice?  I want
to get her something for helping me with
the election.  You know, something
really special -- like flowers or candy
or flowers and candy.  Or is that too
typical?  I mean, can you think of
something? Something really special?
You know, something she'd really like?"
349,TRACY (VO),349,"What happened at the speeches was an
unconscienceable travesty. That little
bitch Tammy Metzier wanted to make a
fool out of me. Well, it wasn't going to
work. People do care who wins. Things do
matter."
350,TRACY,350,"Eric, the ""r"" is supposed to be green,
not blue."
351,ERIC,351,Oh. Okay.
352,ERIC (CONT'D),352,"So, Tracy, I was wondering if after we
finish with these you'd like to go to a
movie or something."
353,TRACY,353,That's okay.  I'm too busy.
354,TRACY (VO CONT'D),354,"People are so ungrateful.  If all those
students who cheered for Tammy Metzier
only knew how hard I worked for Millard.
Like all the late nights I spent at the
yearbook office just to give them their
memories."
355,TRACY (VO CONT'D),355,"One of my duties was to clean up the
group photos.  It was a cinch with our
new software."
356,"TRACY
(under her breath)",356,"Let's see... ""save"" is Command ""S.""
Okay."
357,TRACY,357,I didn't do this.  I didn't do it.
358,JIM,358,There's your culprit
359,JIM (CONT'D),359,Shall we give it a name?
360,"SHERRY
(not missing a
beat)",360,Dave.
361,SHERRY,361,Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
362,JIM,362,"No, I... uh, didn't know that"
363,SHERRY,363,All his life.  He's tried everything.
364,"JIM
(about the shower)",364,Still clear?
365,SHERRY,365,Yep.
366,JIM,366,We'll let it run awhile
367,SHERRY,367,This one's clean.
368,SHERRY (CONT'D),368,"I guess you'd better get to work huh?
You're going to be late."
369,SHERRY (CONT'D),369,"Thank you, Jim."
370,SHERRY,370,Hey Yeah?
371,SHERRY,371,"Take me to that motel.  Like you
wanted."
372,JIM,372,Right now?
373,SHERRY,373,"Easy, tiger.  Come by after school.
I'll leave Darryl with the sitter."
374,JIM,374,Three twenty-five.
375,SHERRY,375,Three twenty-five.
376,JIM (VO),376,"What had blossomed between Sherry and
me was too real, too powerful to deny.
For the first time in years, I felt free
and alive!"
377,JIM (VO CONT'D),377,"So as you can imagine, my thoughts
weren't on the election that Monday
morning."
378,JIM (VO CONT'D),378,"My thoughts were only on Sherry, on how
perfect she felt inside. There was a
special poem I wanted to read to her
later, at the motel, as she lay next to
me."
379,VOICE (OS),379,"Mr. McAllister to the Principal's
Office.  Mr. McAllister to the
Principal's office."
380,LISA,380,It's not fair.  It's not fair
381,PAUL,381,"I just don't think anybody would do
something like that on purpose.  It must
have been some kind of mistake. Like a
maintenance thing."
382,WALT,382,"Jim, where the hell have you been?"
383,JIM,383,"Nowhere.  I don't have class until
second period."
384,WALT,384,"Even tried you at home.  We've got a
situation here."
385,LISA,385,"If Paul loses tomorrow, it's not fair.
There has to be another election,  with
posters."
386,JIM,386,What's the problem?
387,LISA,387,Didn't you see?
388,WALT,388,Somebody tore down their posters.
389,LISA,389,"Those posters cost a lot of money we
don't have I  There's no time to make
any more posters, there's no --"
390,WALT,390,We'll get to the bottom of it.
391,"PAUL
(to Lisa)",391,"We still have some extra ones, don't
we?  Maybe we can just --"
392,LISA,392,It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
393,PAUL,393,"Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy
wouldn't... she..."
394,WALT,394,"Well, that speech she gave -- it was
pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But
we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't
you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to
see to that.  Right, Jim?"
395,"JIM
(his thoughts
elsewhere)",395,"Oh yeah, you bet."
396,LISA,396,She should be expelled.  Or worse!
397,WALT,397,"You two just go back and focus on your
studies.  Mr. McAllister's going to
handle this."
398,MR. BECKMAN,398,Tracy?
399,TRACY (VO),399,"When I arrived at school that morning,
I was shocked to find that one of my key
banners had been removed by vandals. I
noticed that a few of my rival's posters
had also been tampered with. Of course,
I was outraged, but one day before the
election is not the time to lose your
head over a couple of posters. When
you're in the public eye, attacks like
that just come with the territory."
400,JIM,400,"Tracy. Come on in. And shut the door
behind you."
401,JIM,401,I guess you know why you're here
402,TRACY,402,"If it's about the posters, I think it's
so awful. It's a travesty."
403,JIM,403,"A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting,
because I think you did it."
404,TRACY,404,"Wait - are you accusing me? You're not
serious."
405,(indignant),405,"I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have
worked together on SGA for three solid
years and... I mean, I can't believe it.
I'm... I'm shocked!"
406,TRACY (CONT'D),406,"Mr. M., I am running on my
qualifications.  I would never need to
resort to, you know, to vandalism like
a, you know... Plus, my own best banner
was torn down.  Did I do that too?"
407,JIM,407,"Were you or were you not working in the
Watchdog office over the weekend?"
408,TRACY,408,"I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in.
As you know, with all my
responsibilities I often come in on the
weekend and have permission to do so.
But I left very early, around 6:30."
409,JIM,409,"6:30.  How do you know what time the
posters were torn down?"
410,TRACY,410,"I don't.  I just know they were there
when I left.  I'm giving you helpful
information is all.  You know, instead
of wasting time interrogating me, we
should be out there trying to find out
who did this."
411,JIM,411,"Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did
it?  Whom should we ""interrogate?"""
412,TRACY,412,"well, I don't know.  It could have been
anybody.  There are a lot of, you know,
subversive elements around Millard.  You
know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck
and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken -
what about him?  Or what about Tammy
Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti-
this and anti-that."
413,JIM,413,"You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy.
You have many admirable qualities.  But
someday maybe you'll learn that being
smart and always being on top and doing
whatever you need to do to get ahead,
and yes, stepping on people to get
there, well, there's a lot more to life
than that.  And in the end, you're only
cheating yourself."
414,TRACY,414,Why are you lecturing me?
415,JIM,415,"This isn't the time or the place to get
into it, but there is, for just one
example, a certain former colleague of
mine, who made a very big mistake, a
life mistake.  I think the lesson there
is that, old and young, we ail make
mistakes, and we have to learn that our
actions, all of them, can carry serious
consequences.  You're very young, Tracy
underage, in fact -- but maybe one
day you'll understand."
416,TRACY,416,"I don't know what you're referring to,
but I do know that if certain older and
wiser people hadn't acted like such
little babies and gotten all mushy,
everything would be okay."
417,JIM,417,"I agree.  But I also think certain
young and naive people need to thank
their lucky stars and be very, very
grateful the whole school didn't find
out about certain indiscretions which
could have ruined their reputations, and
chances to win certain elections."
418,TRACY,418,"And I think certain older persons like
you and your ""colleague"" shouldn't be
leaching after their students,
especially when some of them can't even
get their own wives pregnant.  And they
certainly shouldn't be running around
making slanderous accusations.
Especially when certain young, naive
people's mothers are para-legal
secretaries at the city's biggest law
firm and have won many successful
lawsuits. And if you want to keep
questioning me like this, I won't
continue without my attorney present."
419,JIM,419,"Okay, Tracy.  Have it your way."
420,TAMMY,420,"You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?"
421,JIM,421,Just wait outside. Tammy.
422,TAMMY,422,Okay.  But is this about the posters?
423,JIM,423,Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
424,TAMMY,424,Okay.
425,(looking at Tracy),425,"Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll
just be outside."
426,JIM,426,"Tracy, don't go away.  Come in, Tammy."
427,TRACY,427,This ought to be good
428,JIM,428,So... what do you have to tell me?
429,TAMMY,429,"Well, this is hard for me, but I think
it's important to be honest. Don't you?"
430,"JIM
(impatient)",430,What is it. Tammy?
431,TAMMY,431,"I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down
Paul's posters."
432,JIM,432,"Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a
word."
433,TAMMY (CONT'D),433,I did it.
434,JIM,434,And when did you do it?
435,TAMMY,435,This weekend.
436,JIM,436,Exactly when?
437,TAMMY,437,I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
438,JIM,438,And how did you get in the school?
439,TAMMY,439,Door was open.
440,JIM,440,Which door?
441,TAMMY,441,I don't know. All I know is I did it I
442,JIM,442,I don't believe you.
443,TAMMY,443,I have proof.
444,TAMMY,444,"You don't know what it's like to grow
up in the shadow of an older brother
like Paul.  it's always Paul, Paul,
Paul, Paul.  Never Tammy.  I'm only
Paul's little sister.  You must be"
445,TAMMY,445,"and I'm so troubled.  I hate him!  I
hate him!  And I tore down his posters,
It was a horrible, cowardly act, but I
did it,.. I did it... l did it... And
I'm not sorry..."
446,JIM,446,"Final  I don't know what your problem
is, but if that's the way you want it,
that's the way it'll be.  I don't have
time.  You're out of the election, and
I'm turning you over to Dr. Hendricks."
447,JIM (CONT'D),447,Tracy?
448,TRACY,448,Yes?
449,JIM,449,Looks like today's your lucky day
450,TRACY,450,What do you mean?
451,JIM,451,"You're off the hook. Tammy here has
confessed."
452,TRACY,452,I told you!  I told you!
453,(pointing at Tammy),453,You're going to pay for my banner!
454,JIM,454,"That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while
you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this."
455,(to Hiss Seeder),455,Could you ask Walt to come in?
456,JIM (VO),456,"The rest of the day was unbearable.  I
kept smelling Sherry on my clothes and
on my fingers and I just couldn't wait
to get out of there."
457,JIM (VO CONT'D),457,"I wanted everything to be perfect that
afternoon, so I decided to give myself a
little time to prepare during eighth
period."
458,JIM,458,"Pop quiz, everybody"
459,JIM (CONT'D),459,"No whining.  If you've done your
reading, this is an easy one."
460,JIM (VO),460,"I'd have exactly forty-eight minutes to
make all the arrangements."
461,JIM,461,"If you finish early, just sit quietly
and check your work.  I'll be right
back."
462,JIM,462,"Okay, everybody, pass them forward.
Stephanie, put down your pen."
463,JIM (CONT'D),463,"I'll see you all on Wednesday. And
don't forget to vote tomorrow."
464,JIM,464,Sherry I
465,JIM (CONT'D),465,Sherry I It's Jim!
466,JIM,466,Sherry
467,JIM (CONT'D),467,Oww! Fuck! Jesus fuck!
468,JIM,468,"By any chance, has a woman shown up in
the last half-hour or so?  Maybe she was
looking for me."
469,EMPLOYEE,469,"Nobody's come in here looking for
anybody.  Just you."
470,JIM,470,Are you sure?
471,"EMPLOYEE
(indicating Jim's
eye)",471,You okay?
472,JIM,472,"Sherry, it's me.  Are you there? Pick
up.  Okay, it's 4:32.  I came by at 3:25
like we said and waited, but you weren't
there.  Anyway, I hope you're okay --
I'm worried about you. So now I'm just
at the...  at the place we talked about.
Suite 219.  So I'm here.  Everything's
all set.  You can just come over.  Can't
wait. Okay.  Bye."
473,DICK METZIER,473,"I don't get it.  What you have against
your mother and me, against your brother
Paul, is completely beyond me.  And your
mother is extremely upset, she's at the
end of her rope.  Your behavior gets
crazier and crazier and wilder and
wilder, and who knows what the hell else
you're doing out there that we don't
even know about?"
474,TAMMY,474,"Dad, I"
475,"DICK
(jabbing his
finger)",475,"Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare
smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I"
476,(taking a breath),476,"Now your mother and I have had a long talk
with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off
the phone with him at home. You know, he
doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's
fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't
blame him!"
477,JO,477,"Dick... Dick,.."
478,DICK,478,What?
479,"JO
(calmly)",479,"Tammy,  now we've come to a decision.
He just think it would be best --"
480,DICK,480,"You're going to Catholic school next
year.  You're going to Sacred Heart.
Maybe they'll straighten you out!"
481,"JIM
(very softly)",481,Okay
482,JIM (VO),482,"As I walked out of my home that
evening, unsure if I'd ever return, my
entire life in question, I somehow
discovered within myself a place of
perfect peace.   Oddly, in my solitude I
felt more than ever a sense of communion
with every human being - past, present
and future.  Because no matter what we
tell ourselves, no matter what illusions
of friendship and family we create, each
of us is always and forever profoundly
alone."
483,TRACY,483,"Dear Lord Jesus, I do not often speak
with You and ask for things, but now I
really must insist that You help me win
the election tomorrow, because I deserve
it and Paul Metzier doesn't, as You well
know.  l realize that it was Your divine
hand that disqualified Tammy, and now
I'm asking that You go that one last
mile and make sure to put me in office
where I belong, so that I may carry out
Your will on Earth as it is in Heaven.
If elected I promise that I will pray
more often.  Okay?  Amen."
484,TAMMY (VO),484,"Dear God, I know I don't believe in
you, but since I'll be starting Catholic
school soon, I thought I should
practice.  Let's see... what do I want?
I want people to be nicer to each other.
I want Lisa to realize what a bitch she
has been and feel really bad and
apologize for how she hurt me and know
how much I still love her.  In spite of
everything, I still want Paul to win the
election tomorrow, not that cunt Tracy.
I also want a really expensive pair of
leather pants... and someday I want to
be really good friends with Madonna.
Love, Tammy"
485,PAUL (VO),485,"Dear God, thank You for all Your
blessings.  You have given me so many
things, like good health, nice parents,
a nice truck, and what I've been told is
a large penis, and I'm very grateful.
But I sure am worried about Tammy.  In
my heart I still can't believe she tore
down my posters, but sometimes she does
get so weird and angry.  Please help her
be a happier person, because she's so
smart and sensitive, and I love her.
Also, I'm nervous about the election
tomorrow, and I guess I want to win and
all, but I know that's totally up to
You.  You'll decide who the best person
is, and I'll accept it.  And forgive my
sins, whatever they may be.  Amen."
486,JIM (VO),486,"Sherry never came home that night.  I
know, because I spent the entire night
in her driveway."
487,TRACY (VO),487,"Mom and I got up at five AM, and
together we custom-iced three hundred
and fifty cupcakes."
488,TRACY,488,Mom?
489,MRS. FLICK,489,Hmmm?
490,TRACY,490,I think I'm going to lose today
491,MRS. FLICK,491,"What are you talking about? This time
tomorrow, you'll be president"
492,TRACY,492,You really think so?
493,MRS. FLICK,493,Tracy Flick's a winner.
494,JIM (VO),494,"I had no choice but to go home. I
needed to shower, get fresh clothes,
explain what I could to Diane.  But what
was I going to say?  That our marriage
had become a charade?  That making love
with Sherry had given me a vision of a
better life?"
495,JIM (VO CONT'D),495,"Then again, maybe I could slip in and
out without waking her up."
496,"TRACY
(chirping)",496,"Good morning, Mr. M."
497,"TRACY (CONT'D)
(holding one out)",497,Looks like you could use a cupcake!
498,"TRACY (CONT'D)
(calling out)",498,"What's wrong with your eye?  Are you
OK?"
499,JIM (VO),499,"Cupcakes.  Jesus Christ.  Cupcakes? My
life was crumbling, and I was expected
to care about these ungrateful kids and
their pathetic little dreams.  As if my
only purpose in life were to serve them."
500,"JIM
(mocking)",500,"Mr. McAllister.  Mr. McAllister.
Somebody tore down my posters. It's not
fair.  It's not fair. Can I have an A?
Can I have a recommendation?  Can I?
Can I?"
501,JIM (VO CONT'D),501,"Well, fuck them.  Didn't I have my own
life?  Didn't I have my own dreams?"
502,JIM (VO CONT'D),502,Cupcakes
503,MR. BECKMAN,503,"Hey, Jim. Big day today"
504,"JIM
(putting on a
smile)",504,"Oh, yeah. Big day."
505,MISS BEEDER,505,"Attention, everyone.  We have an
important announcement from our
principal. Dr. Hendricks."
506,WALT,506,"Good morning, students.  It, uh,
behooves me to inform you of an
important change in today's elections.
Effective this morning..."
507,WALT (OS CONT'D),507,". .. sophomore Tammy Metzier has
been... Metzier has been determined
ineligible - I repeat: ineligible -- for
SGA president.  You may not vote for
Tammy Metzier.  All other candidates are
eligible.  Now please pay attention to a
very important, uh, audio-visual
presentation."
508,"(irritated,
thinking he's off)",508,"Linda, who typed this thing?  I said I
need all caps...."
509,CLARK (ON TV),509,"Hello, students,  I'm Clark Naylor of
Joslyn's Educational Resources.  It's
election day, and how you vote will make
a big difference in the activities,
events, and perhaps even the policies of
your school.  Over the past few days or
weeks, you've heard candidates for the
various offices make their speeches and
tell you where they stand.  You've
probably seen their posters.  Maybe
you've even had a chance to speak with
them personally."
510,CLARK (ON TV CONT'D),510,"Well, today marks the end of
campaigning, and now the spotlight turns
to you. Voting is your privilege and
your responsibility. Remember, no one
needs to know for whom you've voted.
That's between you. . . and you."
511,CLARK (ON TV CONT'D),511,"Now I'd like to introduce you to Tony.
Tony's going to show you how to cast
your vote.  Are you ready, Tony?"
512,TONY (ON TV),512,I think s0
513,CLARK (ON TV),513,Good.  Let's get started
514,SHERRY'S VOICE (VO),514,"Hi.  You've reached the Novotnys. We're
not around, but we'll call you back real
soon.  Have a nice day."
515,JIM,515,"Are you there?  Sherry, are you there?
It's Jim."
516,(suddenly angry),516,"Why did you do that?  I trusted you.
Completely.  You've ruined my life. Do
you know that?  Do you realize that?
Huh?  Do you?  You've ruined Diane's
life.  You ruined my life.  is that what
you wanted?"
517,(recovering),517,"I'm sorry.  It's just... I'm going nuts
here.  Okay, all right, so... Really,
I'm sorry.  I just think we should talk,
okay?  I love you."
518,JIM (VO),518,"If only my own life could be corrected
so easily, with nice fat black lines
drawn neatly through my sins."
519,SALESLADY,519,"And Sacred Heart is such a good school.
Excellent school. The public schools are
going downhill, as far as I'm concerned."
520,JO,520,"Well, we've had good luck at Millard,
but for this one it's time for a change."
521,SALESLADY,521,"So what do you think?  Sacred Heart has
the prettiest.  They have that nice hint
of purple."
522,"TAMMY
(lying)",522,I hate it.
523,JO,523,"You're just going to have to get used
to it."
524,TAMMY,524,"Please, morn.  Please don't make me go
to Sacred Heart.  I beg you."
525,"JO
(to saleslady)",525,We'll take two.
526,TRACY (VO),526,"When the time came to cast our votes, I
stood in line just like everyone else."
527,TEACHER,527,"Hi, Tracy"
528,TRACY,528,Tracy Enid Flick.
529,TEACHER,529,I know.
530,TRACY,530,Phil you ready?
531,PHIL,531,Ready.
532,PHIL,532,Just a second.  My flash.
533,STUDENT,533,"Come on, Tracy."
534,"TRACY
(through her smile)",534,Just wait.
535,TRACY,535,"Thanks, Phil."
536,PAUL,536,"Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?"
537,"TRACY
(awkward)",537,Yeah.
538,PAUL,538,"Hell, good luck!"
539,"TRACY
(reluctant)",539,"Good luck to you too, Paul."
540,PAUL,540,Thanks!
541,PAUL (VO),541,"It's so weird.  DO people always just
vote for themselves?  'Cause looking at
my own name on the ballot, I just... I
don't know, I just felt like it's not
right to vote for yourself."
542,LARRY,542,"Okay, Mr. M."
543,JIM,543,What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
544,LARRY,544,"Well, I thought that... well, the way
it always works is that SGA president
does a count, then the SGA advisor, you
know, for the two independent counts."
545,JIM,545,"Fine.  So do your count.  Start with
president, and I'll be right back."
546,LARRY,546,"You have the key, Mr. McAllister."
547,JIM,547,Right.  I know.
548,LARRY,548,"Are you okay, Mr. M.?"
549,ANOTHER STUDENT,549,What happened to your eye?
550,JIM,550,"I'm fine.  It's just a bee sting, a
simple little everyday bee sting. Some
people, they get stung, it's no big
deal.  Me, I swell up.  Okay?"
551,JIM (CONT'D),551,"I just want to get this over with, so
we can have the assembly and go home.
We don't have much time until eighth
period.  I have other things going on,
too, you know."
552,LARRY,552,Okay.  Yeah.  We know
553,JIM,553,All right.  I'll be back
554,"SHERRY'S VOICE
(cheery)",554,"Hi.  You've reached the Novotnys. We're
not around, but we'll call you back real
soon.  Have a nice day."
555,"SHERRY (OS)
(picking up phone)",555,"What do you want, Jim?"
556,JIM,556,You're there.
557,SHERRY (OS),557,Yeah.  I'm here.
558,JIM,558,Sherry... I love you.
559,"SHERRY (OS)
(loud exhale)",559,"Don't say that.  You know it's not
true."
560,JIM,560,"It's the only true thing I know
anymore."
561,SHERRY (OS),561,"We made a mistake.  Let's not make it
worse."
562,JIM,562,A mistake?  That was no mistake.
563,SHERRY (OS),563,I was lonely.  You took advantage
564,JIM,564,"Me?  I took advantage of you?  You
hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the
one who --"
565,PAUL,565,"Hey, Mr. M. Big day, huh?"
566,"JIM
(impatient)",566,What d'you got?
567,LARRY,567,"I'm not supposed to tell. Not until
you've counted too. We're each supposed
to make an independent count."
568,JIM,568,"You're kidding, right?"
569,LARRY,569,"I thought those were the rules, Mr.
McAllister. If they've changed in any
way --"
570,JIM,570,"Larry, we're not electing the fucking
Pope here. Just tell me who won."
571,LARRY,571,"It's a squeaker, Mr. M. I've got Tracy
by a vote. Just one vote."
572,LARRY (CONT'D),572,Mr. M.?
573,JIM,573,"Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better
do my count."
574,DALE,574,Sputnik.
575,MR. FLAGG,575,Right.  And what year was that?
576,DALE,576,1958?
577,MR. FLAGG,577,"Almost.  1957.  So the point here is
when we found out about Sputnik, we got
really scared.  It seemed like no matter
what we had and kept secret, they could
develop it too.  A-bombs, h-bombs,
rocket ships.  And this time we were
behind them.  So -- February 1961,
Kennedy tells Congress and the American
people he wants to go to the moon.  May
1961, the Apollo program is announced..."
578,TRACY (VO),578,"You know that moment when they announce
the winner of a beauty pageant?  When
Miss Texas or whoever suddenly realizes
she's Miss America, and all she can do
is scream and weep and hug the losers?
I had my moment in the hallway that
Tuesday afternoon with no one to hug but
myself."
579,JIM (VO),579,"I was at the end of my count when it
happened.  I'd come up with exactly the
same numbers as Larry:  Tracy had won
the election by a single vote, 256 to
257.  I was about to announce my tally
when..."
580,JIM (VO CONT'D),580,"The sight of Tracy at that moment
affected me in a way I can't fully
explain.  Part of it was that she was
spying, but mostly it was her face.
Looking at her, you might think she was
a sweet, innocent teenage girl. But she
wasn't sweet.  And she wasn't innocent.
She was selfish and cynical and
ambitious and thought nothing of
destroying the lives of others to get to
the top. who knew how high she would
climb in life, how many people would
suffer because of her? I had to stop her
now."
581,JIM,581,Larry?
582,"LARRY
(looking up)",582,Yeah?
583,JIM,583,I think we've got a problem.
584,WALT,584,"253... 254... 255. I get the same as
you Jim. Looks like Paul's our
president."
585,LARRY,585,No way I It doesn't make sense.
586,WALT,586,"Sorry. My figures work out exactly the
same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for
Tracy."
587,LARRY,587,"And 290 ""disregards,"" right?"
588,WALT,588,If you say so.
589,JIM,589,Mostly Tammy fans
590,LARRY,590,"See, it doesn't add up. There are only
801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two
votes are missing. Check the register."
591,JIM,591,"He's right. Two people must have
pocketed their ballots. Usually it's
more."
592,LARRY,592,"But, they were there I counted 803
votes."
593,JIM,593,"It happens, Larry. People make
mistakes."
594,LARRY,594,"I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was
there when you sac down"
595,WALT,595,"Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where
you're going."
596,LARRY,596,"I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every
vote was accounted for."
597,"JIM
(stern)",597,"Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes
until the assembly, and we still have to
do counts for VP, Treasurer and
Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both
verified the numbers, and unless you can
come up with the ballots you claim are
missing -"
598,LARRY,598,"But, Mr. M. -"
599,WALT,599,"Fouch, that's enough! End of story."
600,TRACY,600,"Paul, I just want you to know that no
matter how this turns out, you've run a
wonderful campaign. It's been fun
competing with you."
601,PAUL,601,"Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad
it's over."
602,TRACY,602,Yeah.
603,PAUL (VO),603,"You know, I don't understand why
everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the
time.  She was always super- nice to me."
604,JIM,604,"If we could get started.  People! Once
the winners are announced, we can all go
home, okay?"
605,JIM (CONT'D),605,"Some contests are so well fought that
is seems unfair for someone to win and
someone to lose.  I think that's the
case with all the candidates you see
before you today.  All of them are
highly qualified and embody the, uh, the
integrity we expect from our school
leadership."
606,TRACY (VO),606,"Act surprised. Walk slowly to the
podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this
incredible honor."
607,JIM,607,"That said, the whole point of an
election is to choose winners, and that
you have done.  We'll begin with
president."
608,JIM (CONT'D),608,"Let me add that this was an
extraordinarily close race. It's my
pleasure to announce the next president
of Millard High School."
609,JIM,609,Paul Metzier!
610,PAUL,610,"Geez, you guys, thanks a lot.  I mean,
wow, thanks.  I promise to do my best
and really do a good job and be a good
president.  And I want to thank Lisa
Flanagan for being a super campaign
manager. And I just want to say that I
think Tracy would have made a great
president too and that she really
deserves a big hand."
611,JIM,611,"And now, for vice-president."
612,JIM,612,Could I get a...?
613,PAUL,613,"Wow! Mr. McAllister! This is so wild.
We came to celebrate my victory, and I
can't believe it. Here, these are my
parents."
614,"DICK METZLER
(extending his
hand)",614,Hi. Dick Metzier. My wife --
615,PAUL,615,This is great.
616,"JIM
(extending his
hand)",616,JIM McAllister.
617,"JO METZLER
(extending her
hand)",617,"JO Metzier. You know, Paul just thinks
the world of you. Oh, if you could just
hear him..."
618,DICK,618,"Yeah, say, apparently you've really
come behind him, really helped him out
there with the student council thing and
all."
619,PAUL,619,"I never would have ran if it wasn't for
Mr. M."
620,JIM,620,"Paul doesn't need any of my help. He's
going places.  You should be very proud."
621,JO,621,We are
622,DICK,622,Having a problem with your eye there?
623,JO,623,Dick.
624,JIM,624,Just a bee sting.
625,DICK,625,"You ought to get that looked at. Shot
of cortisone or something."
626,JIM,626,"Thanks, I'll be fine."
627,DICK,627,"Anyway, we're awful sorry about what
went on with our other one, you know,
our Tammy."
628,JO,628,We were mortified...
629,JIM,629,"Oh, she's not a bad girl.  She'll come
around."
630,JO,630,"... but we've had some good talks, and
I think we're sorting things out.  We're
starting her at Sacred Heart in the
fall."
631,JIM,631,Good school.
632,DICK,632,"Say, you're all alone,  why don't you
join us?"
633,PAUL,633,Yeah!
634,JIM,634,"Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up
here, and I've got to get home."
635,"PAUL
(to his parents)",635,"Why don't you guys go sit down, okay?
I'll catch up in a minute? I want to
talk to Mr. M. about some important
stuff."
636,DICK,636,"All right.  Well, sure nice to meet
you."
637,JO,637,So nice
638,JIM,638,You bet.
639,PAUL,639,"So, Mr. M,  I was starting to think
about ideas for next year. I was
thinking it would be cool to have, like
a carnival.  With rides.  And, you know,
it could be for, like. Muscular
Dystrophy."
640,PAUL (CONT'D),640,"And on Halloween we could have a
haunted house.  But a really good
haunted house, not like those cheesy bad
ones.  You know, more like the radio
station ones.  This one would be really
scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you
know how last year's theme was -"
641,JIM,641,"Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of
time to get into all this later.  A
whole year, in fact. Right now I just
need to finish my pie and get home."
642,PAUL,642,"Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry."
643,PAUL (CONT'D),643,"Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh,
do you think Tracy's going to be okay?
I saw her face after the assembly, and I
think she's taking it pretty hard."
644,JIM,644,"Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be
fine."
645,TRACY,645,One vote... one vote
646,BARBARA,646,"Why don't you take a couple of my
pills, darling? You'll feel better."
647,BARBARA (CONT'D),647,"Don ' t worry. .. don ' t worry. . .
sshhhhh... that's it, baby... that's it,
darling. Everything's going to be fine."
648,BARBARA (CONT'D),648,"Maybe you needed more posters, honey.
Or if you'd taken my suggestions about
your speech. I don't know. We'll figure
it out."
649,JIM,649,"Diane, I..."
650,JIM (VO),650,"I don't know how Diane and I made it
through that night, but we did.  Our
marriage had gone right to the brink,
but in the end I guess it was saved by
one simple fact: we truly loved each
other.  So we made a commitment to begin
the painful process of piecing our lives
back together.  The worst was over; the
mistakes of the past were behind us."
651,JIM (VO),651,"The next day held the promise of a new
beginning. After all, what harm had
really been done? No one was dead."
652,JIM,652,"Hi, Linda."
653,JIM (VO CONT'D),653,"Life would go on, and I would certainly
be a stronger and wiser person from the
experience."
654,MISS BEEDER,654,"Uh, Jim?"
655,JIM,655,Hmm?
656,MISS BEEDER,656,Walt needs to see you.
657,JIM,657,Oh.  Okay.
658,JIM,658,You rang?
659,WALT,659,"Mr. McAllister, I hope you can help us
clear something up."
660,BARBARA,660,"Look at his face!  He knows he's been
caught. Look at his face!"
661,(to Jim),661,"Your ass is grass, Mister!"
662,LARRY,662,"You said I was a liar   You're the
liar, you're the --"
663,WALT,663,"Larry, you just take it easy"
664,MS. HOY,664,Yo --
665,CLASS,665,pierdo.
666,MS. HOY,666,Tu
667,CLASS,667,pierdes.
668,MS. HOY,668,El/ella -
669,CLASS,669,pierde.
670,MS. HOY,670,Senor presidente?
671,MS. HOY (CONT'D),671,Quieren verte en la oficina.
672,PAUL,672,Huh?
673,PAUL,673,"Senor presidente. Yo soy senor
presidente... El grande presidente..."
674,PAUL (VO),674,"I don't know why, but finding out there
was a mistake and I hadn't won the
election after all didn't bother me that
much. Winning had seemed kind of unreal
anyway. I guess I should have voted for
myself. Oh, well."
675,"WALT
(standing up)",675,"Take a seat, son. We've got something
hard to tell you."
676,PAUL,676,Is Tammy okay?
677,WALT,677,She's okay. It's about the election.
678,JIM (VO),678,"After Paul got the bad news, Walt asked
for a few minutes alone with me. It was
very simple, really. I offered my
resignation, and he accepted. Very
quietly, it was all over for JIM
McAllister at Millard High - twelve
years of hard work down the drain."
679,JIM,679,"Walt will be speaking with you about
this, but I need you to find someone to
take over my classes. The lesson plans
for the rest of the year are in my top
right drawer."
680,MISS BEEDER,680,"Okay, Jim. I understand."
681,JIM,681,Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
682,JIM (VO),682,"I don't remember driving home, or much
of anything that happened in the next
few days."
683,JIM (VO CONT'D),683,"There were news stories in the paper
and on television, former students
calling with their support, endless
hours of doing nothing, thinking
nothing."
684,JIM (VO CONT'D),684,"Diane stood by me through the entire
humiliating ordeal, in a way, it sort of
evened things out between us."
685,JIM (VO CONT'D),685,"Soon school was over, and summer
stretched out in front of me as it
always had. Funny how the rhythm of the
school year remains ingrained in you for
life. in mid-June we found out Diane was
pregnant."
686,PAUL (VO),686,"Senior year was great I Sure, I didn't
get to play ball or be president, but I
got elected homecoming king and prom
king anyway. I got into Nebraska like I
wanted and early-rushed Phi Delts. At
the end of the year me and my buddies
threw a hitching Mexican party down at
the cement plant. Shit, that was a good
party. That was a good party!"
687,PAUL (VO CONT'D),687,"The only really bad thing about senior
year was Lisa. Right before Christmas
she dumped me. One minute she's totally
in love with me and then boom she's
going out with my football buddy Randy."
688,PAUL (VO CONT'D),688,"Sometimes I wonder what would've
happened if I'd actually won the
election.  Maybe my whole life would be
different.  Like I might never have gone
to Yosemite with Greg and Travis."
689,PAUL (VO CONT'D),689,Or maybe I'd be dead.
690,TAMMY (VO),690,Catholic school was great!
691,TAMMY (VO CONT'D),691,"I mean, the teachers kind of sucked,
and they were supposedly way more
strict, but you could get away with
murder."
692,TAMMY (VO CONT'D),692,"The best thing about Sacred Heart was
meeting Jennifer."
693,TAMMY (VO CONT'D),693,"All those feelings I had for Lisa were
just preparing me for the real thing.
Jennifer and I are soul mates, and we're
never, ever, ever going to be apart."
694,TRACY (VO),694,"Senior year was very productive for me
and full of personal achievement."
695,TRACY,695,"Order.  Order.  Order I  Can we vote on
this?  Those in favor."
696,TRACY (VO),696,"On top of a very successful student
council year, I got into Cornell like I
wanted, with scholarships, and I was in
the top 7th percentile of my graduating
class."
697,TRACY (VO CONT'D),697,"But sometimes I got lonely, and I'd
think about Dave.  I missed our talks.
Maybe it could have worked out between
us.  I don't know."
698,TRACY (VO CONT'D),698,"I wonder what he's doing now. Maybe he
finally finished his novel"
699,TRACY (VO),699,"When the yearbooks came out, I was on
almost every page."
700,TRACY,700,"Paul, will you sign my yearbook?"
701,PAUL,701,"Sure, Tracy."
702,TRACY,702,Can I sign yours too?
703,PAUL,703,"Oh, yeah, sure."
704,(to a friend),704,"Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when
you're done*"
705,TRACY (VO),705,"I thought very carefully about what to
write.  Because despite everything that
had happened with the election, I really
wished him well.  I even signed it..."
706,PAUL,706,"Thanks, Tracy."
707,PAUL (CONT'D),707,"Hey, Tracy I.."
708,TRACY,708,"Yes, Paul?"
709,PAUL,709,"Have a great summer.  And good luck at
college."
710,"TRACY
(genuinely moved)",710,"Thanks.  You too.  It was great working
with you."
711,TRACY (VO),711,"After graduation, I don't know.  ;
somehow felt empty inside.  I guess high
school just seemed so meaningless now
and I couldn't wait to get out of Omaha.
Next year I was going to make all new
friends.  Smarter, more ambitious
friends.  It was time to move on. There
was nothing left for roe here.  I just
had one more thing to take care of."
712,JIM (VO),712,"After two months of sitting on my ass
and two months helping out at my
brother-in-law's travel agency..."
713,JIM (VO CONT'D),713,"...I landed a position at a Saturn
dealership."
714,JIM (VO CONT'D),714,"I never thought I'd end up selling
cars, but it's not so bad. I like the
Saturn philosophy -- it really is a
different kind of company."
715,JIM (VO CONT'D),715,"I'm just relieved to have a steady
income now that there are three of us."
716,JIM (VO),716,"Actually, it wasn't so difficult making
the transition from teaching to selling.
It's like I tell my customers: my role
is just to educate people so they can
make informed decisions."
717,JIM (VO CONT'D),717,"When I send someone home with a new
unit, I feel a genuine sense of pride."
718,JIM (VO CONT'D),718,"So that's about it.  Maybe I'll get
back to teaching someday, but for the
time being, I guess I'm pretty happy
where I'm at."
719,"SALESMAN
(to Jim)",719,"Hey, Professor.  There's a young gal
out here asking for you."
720,JIM,720,Oh
721,"SALESMAN
(low, as JIM
passes)",721,She's a real hot tamale.
722,TRACY,722,"Hello, Mr. M."
723,JIM,723,"Hello, Tracy."
724,JIM (CONT'D),724,So what brings you here?
725,TRACY,725,I'm looking at new cars.
726,JIM,726,"Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came
to the right place"
727,TRACY,727,"My mother's buying me a new car for
college."
728,JIM,728,"Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are
you going?  Where 'd you get into?"
729,TRACY,729,"Well, I got in everywhere I applied,
but Cornell is my first choice."
730,JIM,730,Good for you.  Good for you
731,JIM (CONT'D),731,"So, are you looking for something
sporty or more practical?"
732,TRACY,732,Sporty.
733,TRACY,733,Where to?
734,JIM,734,Anywhere you want.
735,(checks his watch),735,"Just so long as we're not gone more
than a half-hour."
736,JIM,736,"Handles pretty good, don't you think?"
737,TRACY,737,Yeah.
738,JIM,738,"Plenty of pep, too."
739,TRACY,739,Uh-huh.
740,JIM,740,"And this model comes with ABS and dual
air bags standard."
741,TRACY,741,That sounds good.
742,JIM,742,So Tracy?
743,TRACY,743,Yes?
744,JIM,744,Why are you doing this?
745,TRACY,745,Doing what?
746,JIM,746,"Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. .
humiliate me?"
747,TRACY,747,"Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am
looking for a new car.  But I just
thought, well, I'm going away soon, and
you'll be stuck here and, I don't know,
I just think maybe if things had been
different we might have been, well,
friends. Real friends.  And then things
would be different.  Don't you think?"
748,JIM,748,"Well, I... I... that's very nice of
you."
749,"TRACY
(excited)",749,I've got an idea.
750,JIM,750,What's this?
751,TRACY,751,My house.
752,JIM,752,I don't understand.  What's the deal?
753,TRACY,753,I want you to do something for me.
754,JIM,754,"Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell
awaits him."
755,"TRACY
(getting out)",755,"I just have to get something. I'll be
right back."
756,JIM,756,"Oh, is this...?"
757,"(thumbing through
it)",757,"God. First one of these I haven't been
in for a long time."
758,TRACY,758,Would you sign it for me?
759,JIM,759,What a surprise.
760,TRACY,760,Take as much room as you want
761,TRACY (CONT'D),761,"I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel
ready for college."
762,JIM,762,You'll be fine.
763,TRACY,763,I hope so
764,JIM,764,You will.
