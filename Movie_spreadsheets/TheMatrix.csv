pack of beer and a box of Captain
Crunch.  Returned home."

the usual exit."
7,CYPHER (V.O.),7,"Do you know when we're going to
make contact?"
8,TRINITY,8,Soon.
9,CYPHER (V.O.),9,"Just between you and me, you don't
believe it, do you?  You don't
believe this guy is the one?"
10,TRINITY (V.O.),10,I think Morpheus believes he is.
11,CYPHER (V.O.),11,I know.  But what about you?
12,TRINITY (V.O.),12,"I think Morpheus knows things that
I don't."
13,CYPHER (V.O.),13,"Yeah, but if he's wrong --"
14,TRINITY (V.O.),14,Did you hear that?

27,AGENT SMITH,27,"Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders --"
28,LIEUTENANT,28,"I'm just doing my job.  You gimme
that Juris-my dick-tion and you
can cran it up your ass."
29,AGENT SMITH,29,The orders were for your protection.
30,LIEUTENANT,30,"I think we can handle one little

31,LIEUTENANT,31,"I sent two units.  They're
bringing her down now."

35,TRINITY,35,"Morpheus!  The link was traced!  I
don't know how."
36,MORPHEUS (V.O.),36,I know.  Stay calm.
37,TRINITY,37,Are there any agents?
38,MORPHEUS (V.O.),38,Yes.
39,TRINITY,39,Goddamnit!
40,MORPHEUS (V.O.),40,"You have to focus.  There is a
phone.  Wells and Laxe.  You can
make it."
41,TRINITY,41,All right --
42,MORPHEUS (V.O.),42,Go.
43,COP,43,Motherfucker -- that's impossible!
44,TRINITY,44,"Get up, Trinity.  You're fine.
Get up -- just get up!"
45,AGENT SMITH,45,"Did you get anything from the
room?"
46,AGENT JONES,46,"Their next target.  The name is
Neo."
47,AGENT SMITH,47,We'll need a search running.
48,AGENT JONES,48,It's already begun.
49,SCREEN,49,"JACKON:  I heard Morpheus has been
on this board.
SUPERASTIC:  Morpheus doesn't even
exist and the Matrix is nothing
but an advertising gimmick 4 a new
game.
TIMAXE:  All I want to know is
Trinity really a girl?
LODIII:  87% of all women on line
are really men.
QUARK:  The Matrix is a euphemism
for the government.
SUPERASTIC:  No, The Matrix is the
system controlling our lives.
TIMAXE:  You mean MTV.
SUPERASTIC:  I mean Sega.
FOS4:  ALL HAIL SEGA!!!"
50,NEO,50,Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.
51,SCREEN,51,"Do you want to know what the
Matrix is, Neo?"
52,SCREEN,52,"SUPERASTIC:  Who said that?
JACKON:  Who's Neo?
GIBSON:  This is a private board.
If you want to know, follow the
white rabbit."
53,NEO,53,What the hell...
54,SCREEN,54,"TIMAXE:  Someone is hacking the
hackers!
FOS4:  It's Morpheus!!!!!
JACKON:  Identify yourself.
Knock, knock, Neo."
55,VOICE (O.S.),55,"Hey, Tommy-boy!  You in there?"
56,NEO,56,"What do you want, Anthony?"
57,ANTHONY,57,"I need your help, man.  Desperate.
They got me, man.  The shackles of
fascism."
58,NEO,58,You got the money this time?
59,DUJOUR,59,"You can really get that thing off,
right now?"
60,ANTHONY,60,"I told you, honey, he may look
like just another geek but this
here is all we got left standing
between Big Brother and the New
World Order."
61,ANTHONY,61,"Look at 'em.  Automatons.  Don't
think about what they're- doing or
why.  Computer tells 'em what to
do and they do it."

63,ANTHONY,63,"Thanks, neighbor."
64,DUJOUR,64,"Why don't you come to the party
with us?"
65,NEO,65,"I don't know.  I have to work
tomorrow."
66,DUJOUR,66,Come on.  It'll be fun.
67,NEO,67,"Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go."
68,TRINITY,68,"Hello, Neo."
69,NEO,69,How did you know that --
70,TRINITY,70,"I know a lot about you.  I've been
wanting to meet you for some time."
71,NEO,71,Who are you?
72,TRINITY,72,My name is Trinity.
73,NEO,73,"Trinity?  The Trinity?  The
Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.
Kansas City D-Base?"
74,TRINITY,74,That was a long time ago.
75,NEO,75,Gee-zus.
76,TRINITY,76,What?
77,NEO,77,I just thought... you were a guy.
78,TRINITY,78,Most guys do.
79,NEO,79,"Do you want to go sorewhere and
talk?"
80,TRINITY,80,"No.  It's safe here and I don't
have much time."
81,NEO,81,"That was you on the board tonight.
That was your note, wasn't it?"
82,TRINITY,82,"I had to gamble that you would see
and they wouldn't."
83,NEO,83,Who wouldn't?
84,TRINITY,84,"I can't explain everything to you.
I'm sure that it's all going to
seem very strange, but I brought
you here to warn you, Neo.  You
are in a lot of danger."
85,NEO,85,What?  Why?
86,TRINITY,86,"They're watching you.  Something
happened and they found out about
you.  Normally, if our target is
exposed we let it go.  But this
time, we can't do that."
87,NEO,87,I don't understand --
88,TRINITY,88,"You came here because you wanted
to know the answer to a hacker's
question."
89,NEO,89,The Matrix.  What is the Matrix?
90,TRINITY,90,"Twelve years ago I met a man, a
great man, who said that no one
could be told the answer to that
question.  That they had to see
it, to believe it."
91,TRINITY,91,"He told me that no one should look
for the answer unless they have to
because once you see it,
everything changes.  Your life and
the world you live in will never
be the same.  It's as if you wake
up one morning and the sky is
falling."
92,TRINITY,92,"The truth is out there, Neo.  It's
looking for you and it will find
you, if you want it to."
93,TRINITY,93,"That's all I can tell you right
now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good
luck."
94,NEO,94,"Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the
man?"
95,TRINITY,95,You know who.
96,NEO,96,Shitshitshit.
97,RHINEHEART,97,"You have a problem, Mr. Anderson.
You think that you're special.
You believe that somehow the rules
do not apply to you."
98,RHINEHEART,98,"Obviously, you are mistaken."
99,RHINEHEART,99,"This company is one of the top
software companies in the world
because every single employee
understands that they are a part
of a whole.  Thus, if an employee
has a problem, the company has a
problem."
100,RHINEHEART,100,"The time has come to make a
choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you
choose to be at your desk on time
from this day forth, or you choose
to find yourself another job.  Do
I make myself clear?"
101,NEO,101,"Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly
clear."
102,TALL EMPLOYEE,102,What did he say?
103,NEO,103,"If I was late again, I'm going to
be fired."
104,TALL EMPLOYEE,104,"Well, it was nice working with
you."
105,VOICE (O.S.),105,Thomas Anderson?
106,NEO,106,Yeah.  That's me.
107,FEDEX,107,Have a nice day.
108,NEO,108,Hello?
109,MORPHEUS (V.O.),109,"Hello, Neo.  This is Morpheus."
110,MORPHEUS (V.O.),110,"I had hoped for this conversation
to take place under less adverse
conditions, but you can never
count on hope, can you, Neo?"
111,NEO,111,... no.
112,MORPHEUS (V.O.),112,"I've been watching you, Neo, and I
want to meet you.  I don't know if
you're ready to see what I want to
show you, but unfortunately, we
have run out of time.  They're
coming for you, Neo.  And I'm not
sure what they're going to do."
113,NEO,113,Who's coming for me?
114,MORPHEUS (V.O.),114,Stand up and see for yourself.
115,NEO,115,Right now?
116,MORPHEUS (V.O.),116,Yes.  Now.
117,MORPHEUS (V.O.),117,Do it slowly.  Slowly.  The elevator.
118,NEO,118,Holy fuckin' shit!
119,MORPHEUS (V.O.),119,Yes.
120,NEO,120,"What the fuck do they want with
me?!"
121,MORPHEUS (V.O.),121,"I'm not sure.  But, if you don't
want to find out, you better get
out of there."
122,NEO,122,How?!
123,MORPHEUS (V.O.),123,"I can guide you out, but you have
to do exactly what I say."
124,MORPHEUS (V.O.),124,"The cubicle across from you is
empty."
125,NEO,125,But what if...?
126,MORPHEUS (V.O.),126,Go!  Now!
127,MORPHEUS (V.O.),127,Stay here for a moment.
128,MORPHEUS (V.O.),128,A little longer...
129,MORPHEUS (V.O.),129,"When I tell you, go to the end of
the row to the first office on the
left, stay.as low as you can."
130,MORPHEUS (V.O.),130,Now.
131,MORPHEUS (V.O.),131,"Good.  Now there is a window.
Open it."
132,NEO,132,How do you know all this?
133,MORPHEUS (V.O.),133,"The answer is coming, Neo."
134,MORPHEUS (V.O.),134,"Outside, there's a scaffold.  You
can use it to get to the roof."
135,NEO,135,No! It's too far away.
136,MORPHEUS (V.O.),136,"There's a small ledge.  It's a
short climb.  You can make it."
137,NEO,137,"No way, no way, this is crazy."
138,MORPHEUS (V.O.),138,"Don't be controlled by your fear,
Neo.  There are only two ways out
of this building.  One is that
scaffold.  The other is in their
custody.  You take a chance either
way.  I leave it to you."
139,NEO,139,"This is insane!  Why is this
happening to me?  What did I do?
I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything.
Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck!"
140,NEO,140,I'm going to die.
141,NEO,141,"This is insane.  I can't do this!
Forget it!"
142,NEO,142,I didn't do anything!
143,TRINITY,143,Shit.
144,AGENT SMITH,144,"As you can see, we've had our eye
on you for some time now, Mr.
Anderson."
145,AGENT SMITH,145,"It seems that you have been living
two lives.  In one life, you are
Thomas A. Anderson, program writer
for a respectable software
company.  You have a social
security number, you pay your
taxes and you help your land lady
carry out her garbage."
146,AGENT SMITH,146,"The other life is lived in
computers where you go by the
hacker alias Neo, and are guilty
of virtually every computer crime
we have a law for, including the
unauthorized use of the D.M.V.
system for the removal of
automobile boots."
147,AGENT SMITH,147,"One of these,lives has a future.
One of them does not."
148,AGENT SMITH,148,"I'm going to be as forthcoming as
I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are
here because we need your help."
149,AGENT SMITH,149,"We know that you have been
contacted by a certain individual.
A man who calls himself Morpheus.
Whatever you think you know about
this man is irrelevant to the fact
that he is wanted for acts of
terrorism in more countries than
any other man in the world.  He is
considered by many authorities to
be the most dangerous man alive."
150,AGENT SMITH,150,"My colleagues believe that I am
wasting my time with you, but I
believe you want to do the right
thing.  It is obvious that you are
an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,
and that you are interested in the
future.  That is why I believe you
are ready to put your past
mistakes behind you and get on
with your life."
151,AGENT SMITH,151,"We are willing to wipe the slate
clean, to give you a fresh start
and all we are asking in return is
your cooperation in bringing a
known terrorist to justice."
152,NEO,152,"Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a
real good deal.  But I think I
have a better one.  How about I
give you the finger --"
153,NEO,153,"And you can cram that file up your
Secret Service sphincter."
154,AGENT SMITH,154,"You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson."
155,NEO,155,You ain't seen nothing yet.
156,AGENT SMITH,156,"The irony of your situation is
that you have no choice."
157,NEO,157,"You can't scare me with this
gestapo crap.  I know my rights.
I want my phone call."
158,AGENT SMITH,158,"And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what
good is a phone call iy you are
unable to speak?"
159,AGENT SMITH,159,"You are going to help us, Mr.
Anderson, whether you want to or
not."
160,MORPHEUS (V.O.).,160,"This line is tapped, so I must be
brief."
161,NEO,161,The agents --
162,MORPHEUS (V.O.),162,"They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you
are.  If they knew what I know,
you would probably be dead."
163,MORPHEUS (V.O.),163,"I don't know what you are thinking
right now but I want you to
understand that I will not give up
on you until you give up on me."
164,MORPHEUS (V.O.),164,Do you still want to meet?
165,NEO,165,... Yes.
166,MORPHEUS (V.O.),166,Take the Howard line south.
167,APOC,167,Come with me.
168,TRINITY,168,We got him.  Call the chop-shop.
169,TRINITY,169,"Listen to me, Neo.  You have to,
trust us."
170,NEO,170,What are you doing?
171,TRINITY,171,"This has to be done for your
protection and ours."
172,TRINITY,172,"You can't understand right now,
but if you're not one of us,
you're one of them."
173,GIZMO,173,"Va va va voom.  Still the hottest
software around."
174,TRINITY,174,"Hello, Gizmo."
175,GIZMO,175,"This is really the guy?  The guy
that Morpheus thinks --"
176,TRINITY,176,Yeah.
177,GIZMO,177,But he's so old.
178,TRINITY,178,"Are you going to help us or aren't
you?"
179,GIZMO,179,"Hacksaw.  Load up the copper-top
and let's get the hell outta here."
180,GIZMO,180,"Okay, first we take a little look
under the hood."
181,GIZMO,181,"You're going to feel a little
prick."
182,NEO,182,What are you doing?
183,TRINITY,183,"We think you're bugged.  We can't
take you to Morpheus until you're
clean."
184,GIZMO,184,There it is.
185,GIZMO,185,Hit him with 10 ccs of local.
186,GIZMO,186,"Here, kitty, kitty, kitty."
187,GIZMO,187,Gotcha!
188,GIZMO,188,Shit.
189,TRINITY,189,What's happening?
190,GIZMO,190,"I don't know.  They've never done
that before."
191,GIZMO,191,Hold him down.
192,NEO,192,Jesus!  God!
193,TRINITY,193,Do something!
194,GIZMO,194,I got it!  Maybe we can stun it.
195,TRINITY,195,"Are you crazy?  That will kill
him."
196,GIZMO,196,"It'll work.  Come on, do it or
Hacksaw will."
197,NEO,197,Do what?
198,TRINITY,198,Clear.
199,NEO,199,"Oh, shit --"
200,GIZMO,200,Hit him again!
201,GIZMO,201,Got it!
202,TRINITY,202,"Neo, are you okay?"
203,TRINITY,203,It's over.  We got it.
204,GIZMO,204,"Nasty little bugger, ain't it?"
205,TRINITY,205,"Thanks for your help, Gizmo."
206,GIZMO,206,"I just hope the man knows what
he's doing."
207,GIZMO,207,"Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for
a copy of that software."
208,TRINITY,208,"Gizmo, you don't have the hardware
to handle this software."
209,TRINITY,209,Let's go.  He's waiting.
210,TRINITY,210,This is it.
211,TRINITY,211,"Let me give one piece of advice.
Be honest.  He knows more than you
can possibly imagine."
212,MORPHEUS,212,At last.
213,MORPHEUS,213,"Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt
have guessed, I am Morpheus."
214,NEO,214,It's an honor.
215,MORPHEUS,215,Please.  Come.  Sit.
216,MORPHEUS,216,"Thank you, Trinity."
217,MORPHEUS,217,"I imagine, right now, you must be
feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling
down the rabbit hole?"
218,NEO,218,You could say that.
219,MORPHEUS,219,"I can see it in your eyes.  You
have the look of a man who accepts
what he sees because he is
expecting to wake up."
220,MORPHEUS,220,"Ironically, this is not far from
the truth.  But I'm getting ahead
of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,
why are you here?"
221,NEO,221,"You're Morpheus, you're a legend.
Most hackers would die to meet
you."
222,MORPHEUS,222,"Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we
both know there's more to it than
that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?"
223,NEO,223,No.
224,MORPHEUS,224,Why not?
225,NEO,225,"Because I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life."
226,MORPHEUS,226,I know exactly what you mean.
227,MORPHEUS,227,"Let me tell you why you are here.
You are here because you have the
gift."
228,NEO,228,What gift?
229,MORPHEUS,229,"I've watched you, Neo.  You do not
use a computer like a tool.  You
use it like it was part of
yourself.  What you can do inside
a computer is not normal.  I know.
I've seen it.  What you do is
magic."
230,NEO,230,It's not magic.
231,MORPHEUS,231,"But it is, Neo.  It is.  How else
would you describe what has been
happening to you?"
232,MORPHEUS,232,"We are trained in this world to
accept only what is rational and
logical.  Have you ever wondered
why?"
233,MORPHEUS,233,"As children, we do not separate
the possible from the impossible
which is why the younger a mind is
the easier it is to free while a
mind like yours can be very
difficult."
234,NEO,234,Free from what?
235,MORPHEUS,235,From the Matrix.
236,MORPHEUS,236,"Do you want to know what it is,
Neo?"
237,MORPHEUS,237,"It's that feeling you have had all
your life.  That feeling that
something was wrong with the
world.  You don't know what it is
but it's there, like a splinter in
your mind, driving you mad,
driving you to me.  But what is
it?"
238,MORPHEUS,238,"The Matrix is everywhere, it's all
around us, here even in this room.
You can see it out your window, or
on your television.  You feel it
when you go to work, or go to
church or pay your taxes.  It is
the world that has been pulled
over your eyes to blind you from
the truth."
239,NEO,239,What truth?
240,MORPHEUS,240,"That you are a slave, Neo.  That
you, like everyone else, was born
into bondage...
... kept inside a prison that you
cannot smell, taste, or touch.  A
prison for your mind."
241,MORPHEUS,241,"Unfortunately, no one can be told
what the Matrix is.  You have to
see it for yourself."
242,NEO,242,How?
243,MORPHEUS,243,Hold out your hands.
244,MORPHEUS,244,"This is your last chance.  After
this, there is no going back."
245,MORPHEUS,245,"You take the blue pill and the
story ends.  You wake in your bed
and you believe whatever you want
to believe."
246,MORPHEUS,246,"You take the red pill and you stay
in Wonderland and I show you how
deep the rabbit-hole goes."
247,MORPHEUS,247,"Remember that all I am offering is
the truth.  Nothing more."
248,MORPHEUS,248,Follow me.
249,CYPHER,249,Shit.
250,TRINITY,250,I knew he would.
251,CYPHER,251,"Morpheus, I know what you believe
but I think this is a mistake.
We're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm
afraid he might pop."
252,MORPHEUS,252,"Haven't I always told you, Cypher,
not to let fear control your life.
Apoc, are we on-line?"
253,APOC,253,Almost.
254,NEO,254,"Apoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen
Virus."
255,APOC,255,That's right.
256,MORPHEUS,256,"Neo, time is always against us.
Will you take a seat there?"
257,MORPHEUS,257,"I imagine you know sonething about
virtual reality."
258,NEO,258,A little.
259,MORPHEUS,259,Tell me about it.
260,NEO,260,"Essentially, it's a hardware
system that uses an apparatus;
headgear, gloves and whatever to
make you feel that you are in a
computer program."
261,MORPHEUS,261,"If the virtual reality apparatus,
as you called it, was wired to all
of your senses and controlled them
completely, would you be able to
tell the difference between the
virtual world and the real world?"
262,NEO,262,"You might not, no."
263,MORPHEUS,263,"No, you wouldn't."
264,NEO,264,You did all this?
265,MORPHEUS,265,"The pill you took is part of a
trace program.  It's going to make
things feel a bit strange."
266,NEO,266,Shit...
267,NEO,267,What is this?  Mescaline?
268,MORPHEUS,268,"Just relax, Neo."
269,NEO,269,Uh-oh...
270,TRINITY,270,It's going into replication.
271,MORPHEUS,271,Apoc?
272,APOC,272,Still nothing.
273,MORPHEUS,273,"Tank, we're going to need the
signal soon.  Stay calm, Neo."
274,NEO,274,It's cold.
275,NEO,275,It's all over me --
276,TRINITY,276,I got a fibrillation!
277,CYPHER,277,"I knew it, I knew it..."
278,MORPHEUS,278,Shit!  Apoc?
279,APOC,279,Targeting... almost there.
280,TRINITY,280,He's going into arrest!
281,CYPHER,281,He's gonna pop!
282,APOC,282,Lock!  I got him!
283,MORPHEUS,283,"Now, Tank now!"
284,MORPHEUS,284,"Welcome to the real world, Neo."
285,MAN (O.S.),285,"Do you think Morpheus is right?
Do you think he could be the One?"
286,WOMAN (O.S.),286,"It doesn't matter now.  But if
he's wrong..."
287,NEO,287,... am I dead?
288,TRINITY,288,Far from it.
289,DOZER,289,He needs a lot of work.
290,MORPHEUS,290,I know.
291,NEO,291,What are you doing?
292,MORPHEUS,292,"Your muscles have atrophied.
We're rebuilding them."
293,NEO,293,Why do my eyes hurt?
294,MORPHEUS,294,You've never used them before.
295,MORPHEUS,295,"Rest, Neo.  The answers are
coming."
296,NEO,296,"Morpheus, what's happened to me?
What is this place?"
297,MORPHEUS,297,More important than what is when?
298,NEO,298,When?
299,MORPHEUS,299,"You believe the year is 1997 when
in fact it is much closer to 2197.
I can't say for certain what year
it is because we honestly do not
know."
300,NEO,300,That's not possible.
301,MORPHEUS,301,"I promised you the truth, Neo, and
the truth is that the world you
were living in was a lie."
302,NEO,302,How?
303,MORPHEUS,303,I'll show you.
304,MORPHEUS,304,"This is my ship, the
Nebuchadnezzar.  It's a
hovercraft.  Small like a
submarine.  It's dark.  It's
cramped and cold.  But it's home."
305,MORPHEUS,305,"This is the main deck.  You know
most of my crew."
306,MORPHEUS,306,"The ones you don't know.  That's
Mouse and Switch.  The two big
guys are Tank and Dozer."
307,MORPHEUS,307,"And this, this is the Core.  This
is where we broadcast our pirate
signal and hack into the Matrix."
308,MORPHEUS,308,"Help him, Trinity."
309,MORPHEUS,309,"Do you remember when I asked you
about an apparatus that could turn
a virtual reality into reality?"
310,MORPHEUS,310,It's right here.
311,MORPHEUS,311,And it's accessed here.
312,MORPHEUS,312,This will feel a little weird.
313,MORPHEUS,313,This is the Construct.
314,MORPHEUS,314,"It is our loading program.  We can
load anything from clothes, to
weapons, to training simulations.
Anything we need."
315,MORPHEUS,315,Sit down.
316,NEO,316,"Right now, we're inside a computer
program?"
317,MORPHEUS,317,"Wild, isn't it?"
318,NEO,318,This isn't real?
319,MORPHEUS,319,"What is real?  How do you define
real?  If you're talking about
your senses, what you feel, taste,
smell, or see, then all you're
talking about are electrical
signals interpreted by your brain."
320,MORPHEUS,320,"This is the Chicago you know.
Chicago as it was at the end of
the twentieth century.  This
Chicago exists only as part of a
neural-interactive simulation that
we call the Matrix."
321,MORPHEUS,321,"You have been living inside
Baulliaurd's vision, inside the
map, not the territory.  This is
Chicago as it exists today."
322,MORPHEUS,322,'The desert of the real.'
323,MORPHEUS,323,"We are, right now, miles below the
earth's surface.  The only place
humans can survive outside the
Matrix is underground."
324,NEO,324,What happened?
325,MORPHEUS,325,"It started early in the twenty-
first century, with the birth of
artificial intelligence, a
singular consciousness that
spawned an entire race of
machines."
326,MORPHEUS,326,"At first all they wanted was to be
treated as equals, entitled to the
same human inalienable rights.
Whatever they were given, it was
not enough."
327,MORPHEUS,327,"We don't know who struck first.
Us or them.  But sometime at the
end of the twenty-first century
the battle was joined."
328,MORPHEUS,328,"The war raged for generations and
turned the face of our planet from
green and blue to black and red."
329,MORPHEUS,329,"It scorched and burned the sky.
Without the sun, the machines
sought out a new energy source to
survive."
330,MORPHEUS,330,"They discovered a new form of
fusion.  All that was required to
initiate the reaction was a small
electric charge.  Throughout human
history we have been dependent on
machines to survive.  Fate, it
seems, is not without a sense of
irony."
331,MORPHEUS,331,"The human body generates more bio-
electricity than a 120-volt
battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s
of body heat."
332,MORPHEUS,332,"We are, as an energy source,
easily renewable and completely
recyclable, the dead liquified and
fed intravenously to the living."
333,MORPHEUS,333,"All they needed to control this
new battery was something to
occupy our mind."
334,MORPHEUS,334,"And so they built a prison out of
our past, wired it to our brains
and turned us into slaves."
335,NEO,335,"No!  I don't believe it!  It's not
possible!"
336,MORPHEUS,336,"I didn't say that it would be
easy, Neo.  I just said that it
would be the truth."
337,NEO,337,Stop!  Let me out!  I want out!
338,NEO,338,Get this thing out of me!
339,TRINITY,339,"Easy, Neo.  Easy."
340,NEO,340,Don't touch me!  Get away from me!
341,CYPHER,341,He's going to pop!
342,NEO,342,"I can't go back, can I?"
343,MORPHEUS,343,"No.  But if you could, would you
really want to?"
344,MORPHEUS,344,"I feel that I owe you an apology.
There is a rule that we do not
free a mind once it reaches a
certain age.  It is dangerous.
They have trouble letting go..
Their mind turns against them.
I've seen it happen.  I broke the
rule because I had to."
345,MORPHEUS,345,"When the Matrix was first built
there was a man born inside that
had the ability to change what he
wanted, to remake the Matrix as he
saw fit.  It was this man that
freed the first of us and taught
us the secret of the war; control
the Matrix and you control the
future."
346,MORPHEUS,346,"When he died, the Oracle at the
temple of Zion prophesied his
return and envisioned an end to
the war and freedom for our
people.  That is why there are
those of us that have spent our
entire lives searching the Matrix,
looking for him."
347,MORPHEUS,347,"I did what I did, because I
believe we have been brought here
for a reason, Neo.  You are here
to serve a purpose, just as I am
here to serve mine."
348,NEO,348,"I told you I don't believe in
fate."
349,MORPHEUS,349,"But I do, Neo.  I do."
350,MORPHEUS,350,"Get some rest.  You're going to
need it."
351,NEO,351,For what?
352,MORPHEUS,352,Your training.
353,TANK,353,Morning.  Did you sleep?
354,NEO,354,No.
355,TANK,355,"You will tonight.  I guarantee it.
I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator."
356,NEO,356,You don't have...
357,TANK,357,"Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my
brother Dozer, we are 100 percent
pure, old fashioned, home-grown
human.  Born free.  Right here in
the real world.  Genuine child of
Zion."
358,NEO,358,Zion?
359,TANK,359,"Zion is the place, man.  You'll
see it one day.  Last human city.
All we got left."
360,TANK,360,"Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm
fairly excited to see what you are
capable of.  I mean if Morpheus is
right and all.  We're not supposed
to talk.about any of that, but if
you are, well then this is an
exciting time.  We got a lot to do
so let's get to it."
361,TANK,361,"We're supposed to load all these
operations programs first, but
this is some major boring shit.
Why don't we start something a
little fun?"
362,TANK,362,How about sore combat training?
363,NEO,363,"Jiujitsu?  I'm going to learn
jujitsu?"
364,NEO,364,No way.
365,NEO,365,Holy shit!
366,TANK,366,"Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready
for more?"
367,NEO,367,Hell yes!
368,MORPHEUS,368,How is he?
369,TANK,369,"Ten hours straight.  He's a
machine."
370,NEO,370,"This is incredible.  I know Kung
Fu."
371,MORPHEUS,371,Show me.
372,MORPHEUS,372,"This is a sparring program,
similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.  Consider this your
first lesson."
373,MORPHEUS,373,Attack me.
374,MOUSE,374,Morpheus is fighting Neo!
375,MORPHEUS,375,"Good.  Adaption.  Improvisation.
But your weakness isn't your
technique."
376,MORPHEUS,376,How did I beat you?
377,NEO,377,You -- You're too fast.
378,MORPHEUS,378,"Do you think my being faster,
stronger has anything to do with
my muscles in this place?"
379,MORPHEUS,379,"Do you believe that's air you are
breathing now?"
380,MORPHEUS,380,"If you can free your mind, the
body will follow."
381,MORPHEUS,381,Again.
382,CABLE,382,Jeezus Keerist!  That boy is fast!
383,MOUSE,383,"You ever seen anyone that fast
that soon, Tank?"
384,TANK,384,Never.
385,APOC,385,"Morpheus is right.  He's got to be
the one."
386,MOUSE,386,I don't believe it!
387,MORPHEUS,387,You are angry with me.
388,NEO,388,"I, uh... maybe."
389,MORPHEUS,389,It's all right.  It's natural.
390,NEO,390,I feel better.
391,MORPHEUS,391,"Good, good.  Anger is a gift, Neo,
but it's a heavy one."
392,MORPHEUS,392,"Tank, load the jump program."
393,MORPHEUS,393,"You have to learn to let go of
that anger.  You must let go of
everything."
394,MORPHEUS,394,"You must empty yourself to free
your mind."
395,NEO,395,Shit.
396,NEO,396,Okie dokie.
397,NEO,397,"Yeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No
problem."
398,CABLE,398,He's gonna make it.
399,APOC,399,No way.  Not possible.
400,MOUSE,400,"No one's ever made their first
jump."
401,SWITCH,401,What if he does?
402,APOC,402,He won't.
403,TANK,403,It's never been done.
404,TRINITY,404,Come on.
405,MORPHEUS,405,Everyone falls the first time.
406,MORPHEUS,406,"If you never know failure, how can
you know success?"
407,MOUSE,407,What does it mean?
408,CABLE,408,It doesn't mean anything.
409,CYPHER,409,"Everyone falls, right, Trinity?"
410,NEO,410,I thought it wasn't real.
411,NEO,411,"If you are killed in the Matrix,
you die here?"
412,MORPHEUS,412,"The body cannot live without the
mind."
413,TRINITY,413,"Neo, I saved you some dinner --"
414,CYPHER,414,"Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the
bejeezus out of ne."
415,NEO,415,Sorry.
416,CYPHER,416,"No, it's all right."
417,NEO,417,What are you doing?
418,CYPHER,418,Midnight watch.
419,NEO,419,Is that... ?
420,CYPHER,420,The Matrix?  Yeah.
421,CYPHER,421,You want a drink?
422,CYPHER,422,"I'll tell you, I feel for you,
man.  I really do.  Most of us
were still young, just punks, when
Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you
had a real life."
423,CYPHER,423,"Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it.
It's good for two things:
degreasing engines and killing
brain cells."
424,CYPHER,424,Did he tell you why he did it?
425,"CYPHER,",425,"I'll be the didn't tell you that
this wasn't the first time he
thought he found the One."
426,CYPHER,426,"Let me give you a piece of advice.
Between you and me, if Morpheus
says you can fly, I wouldn't go
jumping out any windows to find
out if he's right.  Understand?"
427,CYPHER,427,Welcome to the real world!
428,CYPHER,428,"That's what he said to me nine
years ago."
429,CYPHER,429,"The real world.  Ha, what a joke."
430,CYPHER,430,"You know what real is?  I'll tell
you what real is."
431,CYPHER,431,"Real is just another four-letter
word."
432,AGENT SMITH,432,"Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?"
433,CYPHER,433,"Mmm, so, so fucking good."
434,CYPHER,434,"You know, I know that this steak
doesn't exist.  I know when I put
it in my mouth, the Matrix is
telling my brain that it is juicy
and delicious.  After nine years,
do you know what I've realized?"
435,CYPHER,435,Ignorance is bliss.
436,AGENT SMITH,436,Then we have a deal?
437,CYPHER,437,"I don't want to remember nothing.
Nothing!  You understand?  And I
want to be rich.  Someone
important.  Like an actor.  You
can do that, right?"
438,AGENT SMITH,438,"Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan."
439,CYPHER,439,"All right.  You get my body back
in a power plant, reinsert me into
the Matrix and I'll get you what
you want."
440,AGENT SMITH,440,Access codes to Zion.
441,CYPHER,441,"I told you, I don't know them.
But I can give you the man who
does."
442,AGENT SMITH,442,Morpheus.
443,NEO,443,"Jeez, I was wondering about that."
444,TANK,444,What?
445,NEO,445,"Why I was bald here but not in the
Matrix."
446,TANK,446,R.S.I.
447,NEO,447,Residual self image.
448,TANK,448,Good.  Now what's this?
449,NEO,449,"Life systems monitor, glucose
levels."
450,TANK,450,What's that?
451,NEO,451,Main power supply to the core.
452,TANK,452,How about this?
453,NEO,453,"Mainframe self-destruct.  Uses all
remaining power to generate an...
E.M.P?"
454,TANK,454,"Electromagnetic pulse.  Our best
weapon against the machines.  The
problem is if someone is still in
the Matrix when that thing goes
off, they're not coming back."
455,MORPHEUS,455,How's he doing?
456,TANK,456,"We just finished the operation
programs and he's showing great
retention."
457,MORPHEUS,457,"Good.  I want everyone alerted to
12-hour stand-by.  We're going in.
Neo, it's time for you to know why
you're here."
458,NEO,458,What's he talking about?
459,TANK,459,"He's taking you into the Matrix to
see her."
460,NEO,460,See who?
461,TANK,461,The Oracle.
462,MORPHEUS,462,We're in.
463,MORPHEUS,463,"Mouse and Cable hold the exit.
Let's go."
464,NEO,464,Did you have to do this?
465,TRINITY,465,Yeah.
466,NEO,466,What did she tell you?
467,TRINITY,467,Lots of things.
468,NEO,468,Any of them true?
469,TRINITY,469,Some of them.
470,GIZMO,470,Were they good or bad?
471,TRINITY,471,"There's no point in worrylng.
Whatever is going to happen is
going to happen."
472,MORPHEUS,472,We should be back in an hour.
473,MORPHEUS,473,"Do you now understand what it
means when we say, if you're not
one of us, you're one of them?"
474,NEO,474,"The agents.  They're sentient
programs.  They can commandeer any
software hardwired to the
mainframe."
475,MORPHEUS,475,"Anyone that is still in a power
plant.  That is why we try to be
invisible in the Matrix."
476,NEO,476,"The best hacking is always
traceless."
477,MOJO,477,"Morpheus, been a long time coming."
478,MORPHEUS,478,"You're looking well, Mojo."
479,MOJO,479,"You bringing us geriatrics now.
Morpheus?"
480,MOJO,480,"Guess you are locking for a
miracle."
481,MOJO,481,"All right, it's cool.  Go on back."
482,REX,482,You're late.
483,NEO,483,What -- what happened?
484,MORPHEUS,484,"This is the temple.  It is a part
of Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden
inside the Matrix so that we can
access it."
485,PRIESTESS,485,"Hello, Morpheus.  We've been
expecting you."
486,MORPHEUS,486,"Okay, you're on your own.  Go with
them."
487,PRIESTESS,487,"Wait here.  Among the other
Potentials."
488,SPOON BOY,488,"Your spoon does not bend because
it is just that, a spoon.  Mine
bends because there is no spoon,
just my mind."
489,SPOON BOY,489,"Link yourself to the spoon.
Become the spoon and bend
yourself."
490,NEO,490,There is no spoon.  Right.
491,PRIESTESS,491,The Oracle will see you now.
492,NEO,492,Hello?
493,VOICE (O.S.),493,Just come on in.
494,NEO,494,Hello?
495,ORACLE (WOMAN),495,"I know.  You're Neo.  Be right
with you."
496,NEO,496,You're the Oracle?
497,ORACLE,497,"Bingo.  I got to say I love seeing
you non-believers.  It's really a
relief.  All that pomp and
circumstances just plain tucker me
out.  Almost done.  Smell good,
don't they?"
498,NEO,498,Yeah.
499,ORACLE,499,"I'd ask you to sit down, but
you're not going to anyway.  And
don't worry about the vase."
500,NEO,500,What vase?
501,ORACLE,501,The vase.
502,NEO,502,"Shit, I'm sorry."
503,ORACLE,503,"I said don't worry about it.  I'll
get one of my kids to fix it."
504,NEO,504,How did you know...?
505,ORACLE,505,"What's really going to bake your
noodle later on is, would you
still have broken it if I hadn't
said anything."
506,ORACLE,506,"You're cuter than I thought.  I
see why she likes you."
507,NEO,507,Who?
508,ORACLE,508,"Not too bright, though."
509,ORACLE,509,"You know why Morpheus brought you
to see me?"
510,NEO,510,I think so.
511,ORACLE,511,"So? What do you think?  You think
you're the one?"
512,NEO,512,I don't know.
513,ORACLE,513,"You know what that means?  It's
Latin.  Means, 'Know thyself.'"
514,ORACLE,514,"Well, let's have a look at you."
515,ORACLE,515,"Open your mouth.  Say, 'ahhh.'"
516,ORACLE,516,"Hmmm.  You sure got the gift, but
it's tricky.  I'd say the bad news
is, you're not the one.  Still got
a lot to learn.  Maybe next life."
517,NEO,517,What's the good news?
518,ORACLE,518,"Same as the bad news, you're not
the one."
519,NEO,519,"Is that it, then?"
520,ORACLE,520,No.  Here.
521,ORACLE,521,"You better take a cookie.  Got a
big day ahead of you."
522,ORACLE,522,Make a believer out of you yet.
523,MORPHEUS,523,"You don't have to tell me
anything, Neo, because I already
know what she said."
524,NEO,524,You do?
525,MORPHEUS,525,"I brought you so that you could
hear it for yourself.  I knew it
would help."
526,MORPHEUS,526,"No one will ever ask you because
it is a gift from her.  It is for
you and you alone."
527,TRINITY,527,Here they come.
528,TANK,528,"Weird.  This area never has this
much activity."
529,MOUSE,529,Welcome to Movie-Phone.
530,TANK (V.O.),530,They're on their way.
531,MOUSE,531,Right.
532,MOUSE,532,Let's get to work.
533,NEO,533,Whoa.  Deja vu.
534,TANK,534,"Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!"
535,TRINITY,535,What did you just say?
536,NEO,536,"Nothing.  Just had a little deja
vu."
537,TRINITY,537,What happened?  What did you see?
538,NEO,538,"A black cat went past us and then
I saw another that looked just
like it."
539,TRINITY,539,"How much like it?  Was it the same
cat?"
540,NEO,540,It might have been.  I'm not sure.
541,NEO,541,What is it?
542,TRINITY,542,"A deja vu is usually a glitch in
the Matrix.  It happens when they
change something."
543,TANK,543,It's a trap!
544,MORPHEUS,544,Come on!
545,CABLE,545,Did you just feel something weird?
546,MOUSE,546,Yeah...
547,MOUSE,547,What's going on?
548,TANK (V.O.),548,"They cut the hard-line!  It's a
trap!  Get out!"
549,CABLE,549,"Oh, no."
550,TANK,550,"No, no, no."
551,CABLE,551,Morpheus!  It's a trap --
552,TRINITY,552,"Oh, God."
553,CYPHER,553,"That's what they changed.  We're
trapped.  There's no way out."
554,MORPHEUS,554,Give me your phone.
555,TRINITY,555,They'll be able to track it.
556,MORPHEUS,556,We have no choice.
557,MORPHEUS (V.O.),557,"Tank, find a structural drawing of
this building and find it fast."
558,TANK,558,Got it.
559,MORPHEUS (V.O.),559,I need the main wet-wall.
560,TANK (V.O.),560,"Now left and that's it in front of
you."
561,MORPHEUS,561,Good.
562,AGENT SMITH,562,"Eighth floor.  They're on the
eighth floor."
563,AGENT BROWTJ,563,Eighth floor!  Move!
564,AGENT BROWN,564,Where are they?
565,COP,565,They're in the walls!
566,AGENT SMITH,566,"Are orders that hard to follow?
I'll say it again.  Morpheus must
be taken alive.  Understand?"
567,AGENT SMITH,567,How like a rodent.
568,COP,568,I got him!  I got him!
569,MORPHEUS,569,Come on!
570,TANK,570,Nerve gas.
571,AGENT SMITH,571,We have them now.
572,MORPHEUS,572,"You have to get Neo out.
Understand?  That's all that
matters now."
573,TRINITY,573,"Morpheus, don't --"
574,MORPHEUS,574,"He must get out.  Do you
understand me?"
575,COPS,575,There he is!  That's him!
576,COP,576,He's heading for the street!
577,AGENT SMITH,577,"So, we meet at last."
578,MORPHEUS,578,And you are?
579,AGENT SMITH,579,Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
580,MORPHEUS,580,You all look the same to me.
581,AGENT SMITH,581,I've been waiting for this noment.
582,MORPHEUS,582,"Oh, so have I."
583,AGENT SMITH,583,You can't win.
584,MORPHEUS,584,I already have.
585,AGENT SMITH,585,Take him.
586,TANK,586,No!
587,AGENT JONES,587,The others were lost.
588,AGENT SMITH,588,You've taken care of Reagan?
589,AGENT SMITH,589,Then the others do not matter.
590,TRINITY,590,We need a phone.
591,TANK,591,"We gotta find the others.  They're
still alive."
592,TANK,592,Operator.
593,CYPHER (V.O.),593,I need an exit!  Fast!
594,TANK,594,Cypher?  I thought they had you?
595,CYPHER,595,"There was an accident.  A fucking
car accident.  All of a sudden.
Boom.  They're all dead.  I still
got the shakes but, Jesus,
someone's going to make a believer
out of me."
596,DOZER,596,There he is.
597,TANK,597,I got you.
598,CYPHER (V.O.),598,Just get me outta here.
599,TANK (V.O.),599,"Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie.
An old appliance store."
600,CYPHER,600,An actor.  Definitely.
601,TANK,601,Operator.
602,TRINITY (V.O.),602,"Tank, it's me."
603,TRINITY,603,We need an exit!
604,TANK (V.O.),604,"Gotcha.  You're not far from
Cypher."
605,TRINITY,605,"Cypher, I thought --"
606,TANK (V.O.),606,"So did we.  That boy's got nine
lives.  I sent him to Franklin and
Erie."
607,TRINITY,607,Got it.
608,TANK,608,Got him.
609,DOZER,609,System check looks fine.
610,DOZER,610,You okay?
611,CYPHER,611,"Goddamn gas.  My lungs are killing
me."
612,CYPHER,612,We got any pain killers?
613,DOZER,613,The first aid kit's over here.
614,DOZER,614,No!
615,SWITCH,615,"God, I love that sound."
616,TRINITY,616,"You first,.Neo."
617,TRINITY,617,What happened?
618,NEO,618,I don't know.  It just went dead.
619,CYPHER (V.O.),619,"Hello, Trinity."
620,TRINITY,620,Cypher?  Where's Tank?
621,CYPHER (V.O.),621,He had an accident.
622,TRINITY,622,"An accident?  What about Dozer?
Is Dozer there?"
623,CYPHER,623,"You know, for a long time, I
thought I was in love with you,
Trinity.  I used to dream about
you..."
624,CYPHER,624,"You are a beautiful woman.  Too
bad things had to work out like
this."
625,TRINITY,625,You killed them.
626,APOC,626,What?!
627,SWITCH,627,Oh God.
628,CYPHER,628,"In a way you're very lucky.  Most
people never know why they die.
One minute they're alive, the next
they're dead.  No warning.
Nothing.  That's why I thought
maybe I should tell you.  It
seemed the least I could do."
629,CYPHER,629,"You see, the truth, the real,truth
is that the war is over.  It's
been over for a long time.  And
guess what?  We lost!  Did you
hear that?  We lost the war!"
630,TRINITY,630,What about Zion?
631,CYPHER,631,"Zion?  Zion is a part of this
delusion.  More of this madness.
That's why this has to be done.
It has to end.  Now and forever."
632,TRINITY,632,"Oh rny God.  This is abzut Zion.
You gave them Morpheus for the
access codes to Zion."
633,CYPHER,633,"You see, Trinity, we humans have a
place in the future.  But it's not
here.  It's in the Matrix."
634,TRINITY,634,The Matrix isn't real!
635,CYPHER,635,"Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I
disagree.  I think the Matrix is
more real than this world.  I
mean, all I do is pull a plug
here.  But there, you watch a man
die."
636,CYPHER,636,You tell me which is more real.
637,CYPHER,637,"Welcome to the real world, right?"
638,TRINITY,638,"Somehow, some way, you're going to
pay for this."
639,CYPHER,639,"Pay for it?  I'm not even going to
remember it.  It'll be like it
never happened.  The tree falling
in the forest.  It doesn't make a
sound."
640,TRINITY,640,"Goddamn you, Cypher!"
641,CYPHER,641,"Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just
the messenger.  And right now I'm
going to prove that the message is
true."
642,CYPHER,642,"If Morpheus was right, then
there's no way I can pull this
plug, is there?"
643,CYPHER,643,"If he is the One, then in the next
few seconds there has to be some
kind of miracle to stop me.
Because if he dies like the others
that means Morpheus was wrong.
How can he be the One if he's
dead?"
644,TANK,644,"How's it feel, Cypher?  Knowing
you're about to die?"
645,NEO,645,It's Tank!  He's alive.
646,TRINITY,646,"We should, we should hurry."
647,NEO,647,Yeah.  Right.
648,TRINITY,648,"Tank, you're hurt."
649,TANK,649,I'll be all right.
650,TRINITY,650,Dozer?
651,TRINITY,651,"I'm sorry, Tank."
652,AGENT JONES,652,"There is a problem.  Reagan has
failed to secure the hardware."
653,AGENT SMITH,653,"Never send a human to do a
machine's job."
654,AGENT JONES,654,"But if Reagan has failed, why
haven't they pulled the plug?"
655,AGENT SMITH,655,"Haven't you learned by now, that
it is impossible to understand why
they do the things they do?"
656,AGENT SMITH,656,"Continue as planned.  Trace his
signal to locate their position
and deploy an extermination unit."
657,NEO,657,What are they doing to him?
658,TANK,658,They're cracking his mind.
659,NEO,659,How?
660,TANK,660,"They inject virus-like serums to
break down the system.  It's like
cracking a computer.  All it takes
is time."
661,NEO,661,How much time?
662,TANK,662,"Depends on the mind.  But
eventually, it will crack and his
alpha pattern will change from
this to this."
663,TANK,663,"When it does, Morpheus will tell
them anything they want to know."
664,NEO,664,The access codes to Zion.
665,TANK,665,"If an agent got inside Zion's
mainframe he could do anything.
Disable the defense system. It
would be the end of us."
666,TANK,666,"We can't let that happen.  We have
to do it, Trinity.  Zion has to be
protected."
667,TRINITY,667,Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
668,TANK,668,We have to pull the plug.
669,TRINITY,669,No!
670,TANK,670,We don't have any other choice.
671,TANK,671,"Trinity, what are you doing?"
672,TRINITY,672,I'm going in after him.
673,TANK,673,"Morpheus could conform at any
minute --"
674,TRINITY,674,"If he does I'm sure you'll do what
has to be done."
675,TANK,675,You saw that place.  It's suicide.
676,TANK,676,"I know what Morpheus means to
you --"
677,TRINITY,677,"No.  No, I don't think you do.  If
you did, then you would know that
I'm not letting him go.  Not
without a fight, Tank."
678,TRINITY,678,Not without a fight.
679,AGENT SMITH,679,"Have you ever stood and stared at
it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its
beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of
people just living out their
lives... oblivious."
680,AGENT SMITH,680,"Did you know that the first Matrix
was designed to be a perfect human
world?  Where none suffered, where
everyone would be happy.  It was a
disaster.  No one would accept the
program.  Entire crops were lost."
681,AGENT SMITH,681,"Some believed we lacked the
programming language to describe
your perfect world.  But I believe
that, as a species, human beings
define their reality through
suffering and misery."
682,AGENT SMITH,682,"The perfect world was a dream that
your primitive cerebrum kept
trying to wake up from.  Which is
why the Matrix was re-designed to
this:  the peak of your
civilization."
683,AGENT SMITH,683,"I say 'your civilization' because
as soon as we start thinking for
you, it really becomes our
civilization, which is, of course,
what this is all about."
684,AGENT SMITH,684,"Evolution, Morpheus.  Evolution."
685,AGENT SMITH,685,"Like the dinosaur.  Look out that
window.  You had your time."
686,AGENT SMITH,686,"The future is our world, Morpheus.
The future is our time."
687,TRINITY,687,What do you think you're doing?
688,NEO,688,"You need help.  I'm coming with
you."
689,TRINITY,689,"No.  No way.  Morpheus sacrificed
himself so you could escape.
There's no way you're going back
in."
690,NEO,690,"Morpheus did what he did because
he believed that I'm something
that I'm not."
691,TRINITY,691,What?
692,NEO,692,"I'm not the One, Trinity.  The
Oracle told me."
693,NEO,693,"She said I had a gift but I still
had a lot to learn.  She told me
maybe next life."
694,TRINITY,694,Did you tell Morpheus?
695,NEO,695,"Why?  It wouldn't mean anything.
He'd still believe what he wanted
to believe.  But Morpheus is the
one that matters.  He's more
important than me and we both know
it."
696,NEO,696,"I may not be what Morpheus thinks
I am, but if I don't try to help
him, then I'm not even what I
think I am."
697,TRINITY,697,What are you?
698,NEO,698,His friend.
699,AGENT SMITH,699,"I'd like to share a revelation
that I've had during my time here.
It came to me when I tried to
classify your species.  I've
realized that you are not actually
mammals."
700,AGENT SMITH,700,"Every mammal on this planet
instinctively develops a natural
equilibrium with the surrounding
environment.  But you humans do
not.  You move to an area and you
multiply and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed and
the only way you can survive is to
spread to another area."
701,AGENT SMITH,701,"There is another organism on this
planet that follows the same
pattern.  Do you know what it is?
A virus."
702,AGENT SMITH,702,"Human beings are a disease, a
cancer of this planet.  You are a
plague.  And we are... the cure."
703,TANK,703,"Okay.  Store's open.  What do you
need?"
704,TRINITY (V.O.),704,Guns.  Lots of guns.
705,TANK,705,Coming right up.
706,TRINITY,706,"No one has ever done anything like
this."
707,NEO,707,Yeah?
708,NEO,708,That's why it's going to work.
709,AGENT SMITH,709,Why isn't the serum working?
710,AGENT BROWN,710,"Perhaps we are asking the wrong
questions."
711,AGENT JONES,711,Or he doesn't know.
712,AGENT SMITH,712,"Of course he knows.  He's
resisting."
713,AGENT BROWN,713,How?
714,AGENT SMITH,714,I don't know.  If I knew...
715,AGENT SMITH,715,Leave me with him.
716,AGENT SMITH,716,Now!
717,TANK,717,"Hold on, Morpheus.  They're coming
for you.  They're coming."
718,AGENT SMITH,718,"Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm
going to be honest with you."
719,AGENT SMITH,719,"I hate this place.  This zoo.
This prison.  This reality,
whatever you want to call it, I
can't stand it any longer.  It's
the smell, if there is such a
thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I
can taste your stink and every
time I do, I fear that I've
somehow been infected by it."
720,AGENT SMITH,720,"Repulsive, isn't it?"
721,AGENT SMITH,721,"I must get out of here, I must get
free.  In this mind is tlie key.
My key."
722,AGENT SMITH,722,"Once Zion is gone, there's no
need for me to be here.  Do you
understand?  I need the codes.  I
have to get inside Zion.  You have
to tell me how."
723,AGENT SMITH,723,Tell me!  Tell me!
724,AGENT BROWN,724,What were you doing?
725,AGENT JONES,725,You don't know.
726,AGENT SMITH,726,Know what?
727,AGENT JONES,727,"I think they're trying to save
him."
728,NEO,728,There is no spoon.
729,AGENT JONES,729,Lower level --
730,AGENT BROWN,730,They are actually attacking.
731,AGENT SMITH,731,Find them and destroy them!
732,PILOT,732,"I repeat, we are under attack!"
733,NEO,733,Trinity!
734,NEO,734,... help.
735,AGENT JONES,735,Only human...
736,TRINITY,736,"Dodge this, motherfucker!"
737,NEO,737,Thanks.
738,TRINITY,738,You're hit --
739,NEO,739,I'm fine.
740,NEO,740,Can you fly that thing?
741,TRINITY,741,Not yet.
742,TANK,742,Operator.
743,TRINITY (V.O.),743,"Tank, I need a pilot program for a
military M-109 helicopter."
744,TRINITY (V.O.),744,Hurry!
745,TRINITY,745,Let's go.
746,SERGEANT,746,"Sir!  Sir!  There was gunfire --
we've lost communication with the
roof!"
747,AGENT JONES,747,Remain at your posts.
748,SERGEANT,748,"But, sir -- the fire -- we should
evacuate!"
749,AGENT JONES,749,You will do as you are ordered!
750,SERGEANT,750,"Yes, sir."
751,AGENT SMITH,751,No.
752,NEO,752,"Get up, Morpheus!  Get up!"
753,AGENT SMITH,753,Nooo!
754,NEO,754,He won't make it.
755,NEO,755,Gotcha!
756,TRINITY,756,Shit-shit-no!
757,NEO,757,Oh fuck.
758,TANK,758,He's the One.  He's got to be...
759,MORPHEUS,759,I knew it!  I goddamn knew it!
760,TRINITY,760,Morpheus!
761,MORPHEUS,761,"Do you believe me now?  He's the
One!  Who else could have done
this?"
762,NEO,762,"Morpheus, I know you won't believe
me but the Oracle told ne I'm not
the One."
763,MORPHEUS,763,"It doesn't matter if I don't
believe you --"
764,MORPHEUS,764,"What matters is that you don't
believe her."
765,TRINITY (V.O.),765,"Tank, get us out of here."
766,TANK,766,"Got one ready.  An underground El
station.  State and Balbo."
767,TRINITY (V.O.),767,See ya soon.
768,TANK,768,See ya soon.
769,AGENT BROWN,769,The trace was completed.
770,AGENT JONES,770,We have their position.
771,AGENT BROWN,771,"The extermination unit is in
place."
772,AGENT JONES,772,Order the strike.
773,AGENT SMITH,773,They're not out yet.
774,NEO,774,Don't!
775,OLD MAN,775,I'm sorry -- I didn't mean!
776,NEO,776,Get outta here.  Okay?  Run!  Go!
777,TRINITY,777,What happened?  Was that --
778,NEO,778,It was nobody.
779,NEO,779,"Let's go!  You first, Morpheus."
780,TRINITY,780,"Morpheus is right, you know.  It
doesn't matter what he believes or
even what the Oracle believes.
What matters is what you believe."
781,NEO,781,I believe...
782,NEO,782,I want to kiss you.
783,TRINITY,783,I want to kiss you too...
784,TRINITY,784,But I want it to be real.
785,TRINITY,785,Neo!
786,TANK,786,What the hell just happened?
787,TRINITY,787,"An Agent!  You have to send me
back!"
788,TANK,788,I can't!
789,AGENT SMITH,789,You're empty.
790,NEO,790,So are you.
791,AGENT SMITH,791,You can't win.
792,NEO,792,I already have.
793,TRINITY,793,"Jesus, he's killing him!"
794,TRINITY,794,"Send me back, Tank!  Anywhere!"
795,TANK,795,"I'm looking, Trinity!  I'm
looking!"
796,TRINITY,796,What is it... oh no.
797,TRINITY,797,Sentinels.
798,AGENT SMITH,798,"Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?"
799,AGENT SMITH,799,"That is the sound of
inevitability."
800,AGENT SMITH,800,It is the sound of your death.
801,AGENT SMITH,801,"Goodbye, Mr. Anderson."
802,NEO,802,My name is Neo.
803,TRINITY,803,"You can't use that until Neo is
out!"
804,MORPHEUS,804,"I know.  Don't worry, he'll make
it."
805,TANK,805,Operator.
806,NEO (V.O.),806,"Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out
of here!"
807,NEO,807,"Hurry, Tank!  I got some serious
pursuit!"
808,TRINITY,808,"Neo, you better get your ass back
here!"
809,NEO,809,"I'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying."
810,TANK (V.O.),810,I got one!
811,TANK (V.O.),811,Wabash and Lake.  A hotel.
812,TANK (V.O.),812,Room 303.
813,TANK,813,I'm going to make the call.
814,MORPHEUS,814,Do it!
815,TRINITY,815,Where is he?
816,TANK,816,Almost there.
817,MORPHEUS,817,He's going to make it.
818,TRINITY,818,"Hurry, Neo."
819,AGENT SMITH,819,Check him.
820,TRINITY,820,"No-no-no!  Neo, you're not dead!
You can't be dead!"
821,AGENT BROWN,821,He's gone.
822,AGENT SMITH,822,"I told you, you couldn't win."
823,TRINITY,823,"You're right here.  I'm holding
you, Neo.  I'm not letting you go.
Do you hear me?  I won't let you
go."
824,TRINITY,824,"Goddamnit, Neo!  Don't give it up!
Not now!"
825,TRINITY,825,Not now!
826,TRINITY,826,Now get up!
827,AGENT SMITH,827,Nooooo!
828,TRINITY,828,Now!
829,TRINITY,829,Neo?
830,NEO (V.O.),830,"Hi.  It's me.  I know you're out
there.  I know you're working as
fast as you can to catch me."
831,NEO (V.O.),831,"I thought I should call and let
you know how things stand."
832,NEO (V.O.),832,"I know you're real proud of this
world you've built, the way it
works, all the nice little rules
and such, but I've got some bad
news."
833,NEO (V.O.),833,"I've decided to make a few
changes."
834,BOY,834,Mommy!  Mommy!
835,MOMMY,835,What?
836,BOY,836,That man!  That man flies!
837,MOMMY,837,"Don't be silly, honey.  Men don't
fly."
