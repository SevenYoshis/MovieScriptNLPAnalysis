0,CAB DRIVER,0,Where to?
1,WELLES,1,"Follow that limousine.  Don't get
too close, don't let it get too far
away.  Just keep with it."
2,CAB DRIVER,2,You kidding?
3,WELLES,3,Nope.
4,CAB DRIVER,4,"Uh, listen... you're not supposed to
be smoking in here.  I'm sorry,
that's company policy..."
5,WELLES,5,"How about this... every cigarette I
smoke, I give you five dollars?"
6,CAB DRIVER,6,"Okay... okay, yeah, that'd be good..."
7,OLDER WOMAN,7,Thank you.
8,AMY,8,Welcome home.
9,WELLES,9,Do you know how much I missed you?
10,AMY,10,"What's this... have you been
smoking... ?"
11,WELLES,11,Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
12,AMY,12,Your clothing reeks of it.
13,WELLES,13,"You know, Amy, I've been sitting
around in bars and everywhere
following this guy... I mean, is
this what I get first thing?  Before
you even ""hello,"" you accuse me... ?"
14,AMY,14,I'm not accusing you...
15,WELLES,15,"Well, I'm not smoking, okay?"
16,AMY,16,"Okay, I believe you."
17,WELLES,17,"We've been all through that.  I've
been on my best behavior."
18,WELLES,18,"Hello, pumpkin-head, did you miss
me?  I sure missed you..."
19,WELLES,19,"Let's get my bags and get the hell
out of here."
20,AMY,20,How's the detective business?
21,WELLES,21,"Business was fine.  I'll tell you
what, you couldn't pay me enough to
live down there."
22,AMY,22,"You better not be smoking, that's
all I can say."
23,WELLES,23,"Honey, I'm not, please..."
24,AMY,24,I love you.
25,WELLES,25,I love you.
26,WELLES,26,"What's all the trouble, Cinderella?
What are you crying about, huh?"
27,WELLES,27,"Your son-in-law dealt with the dry
cleaning franchise during the day,
saw that woman every night."
28,WELLES,28,"The specifics are in the report, and
information about the woman.  It's
unpleasant, I know.  I apologize..."
29,POLITICIAN,29,"None too discreet, is he?"
30,WELLES,30,"No, sir, he is not."
31,POLITICIAN,31,"He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn
my daughter, but what can you do?"
32,WELLES,32,"The um... you'll find my invoice in
the envelope. If that's all..."
33,POLITICIAN,33,"Yes, Mister Welles, thank you."
34,WELLES,34,"Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever
be of further assistance."
35,AMY,35,"You think you'll have time for the
water heater this weekend?"
36,WELLES,36,Sure.  I'll call the guy.
37,AMY,37,"You're not using the same guy who
tried to fix it?"
38,WELLES,38,"I'm not using him again for
anything.  He was worthless."
39,WELLES,39,You have bridge here Saturday?
40,AMY,40,"Betty's out of town so we're playing
next week."
41,WELLES,41,"Hello.  Yes... could you hold on a
minute...?"
42,WELLES,42,"Okay, I've got it."
43,WELLES,43,"Hello... sorry, I was switching
phones.  It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian."
44,WELLES,44,"Yes.  Yes, I understand... tomorrow
evening should be fine..."
45,MRS CHRISTIAN,45,Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
46,WELLES,46,I try to be.
47,MRS CHRISTIAN,47,"I appreciate your coming on such
short notice."
48,MRS CHRISTIAN,48,"This is Mister Longdale, my late
husband's attorney."
49,WELLES,49,"Uh huh, pleasure."
50,MRS CHRISTIAN,50,"Apparently Mr. Longdale has
something he feels he simply must
say before you and I speak."
51,LONGDALE,51,"Yes, I do have something to say.  I
insisted on being here as soon as I
heard Mrs. Christian contacted you."
52,WELLES,52,I'm listening.
53,LONGDALE,53,"As Mr. Christian's attorney and one
of the executors of his estate, it
concerns me that a meeting of this
sort should take place without my
being asked to attend."
54,WELLES,54,Of what sort?
55,LONGDALE,55,You are a private investigator?
56,WELLES,56,That's right.
57,LONGDALE,57,"Well, whatever reasons Mrs.
Christian has for engaging the
services of a private investigator,
I should certainly be a party to.
But, since she feels differently, I
can only go on the record as having
expressed my adamant disapproval."
58,MRS CHRISTIAN,58,"Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone
on the record, and now perhaps you
should just be gone."
59,MRS CHRISTIAN,59,Have a pleasant evening.
60,MRS CHRISTIAN,60,"Will you have tea, Mister Welles?"
61,WELLES,61,Thank you.
62,WELLES,62,He's odd.
63,MRS CHRISTIAN,63,He's a lawyer.
64,MRS CHRISTIAN,64,"Please, sit, here..."
65,MRS CHRISTIAN,65,"I've spoken to friends of mine and
my husband's, in Harrisburg, in
Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about
you.  I must say you have friends in
influential places."
66,WELLES,66,"I've been privileged to provide
services for people I admire."
67,MRS CHRISTIAN,67,"You are highly recommended.  Praised
for your discretion... your strict
adherence to confidentiality."
68,MRS CHRISTIAN,68,"As you know, my husband passed away
recently.  Two weeks ago now."
69,WELLES,69,My condolences.
70,MRS CHRISTIAN,70,"His passing has left me with...
something of a dilemma.  A terrible,
terrible dilemma."
71,WELLES,71,I'll do whatever I can to help.
72,MRS CHRISTIAN,72,His inner sanctum.
73,MRS CHRISTIAN,73,"Not many people have been inside
this room."
74,WELLES,74,Pittsburgh?
75,MRS CHRISTIAN,75,"Mostly.  That's where he started his
empire building."
76,MRS CHRISTIAN,76,"He was a good man.  Notorious as an
eccentric, but that was something he
cultivated.  He"
77,MRS CHRISTIAN,77,legendary.
78,WELLES,78,He succeeded.
79,MRS CHRISTIAN,79,"We were married forty-five years.
Hard even for me to imagine.  We had
our troubles.  There were plenty of
places for him to be other than
here, but he was always loyal to me,
and I to him.  I loved him deeply."
80,MRS CHRISTIAN,80,"Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?"
81,WELLES,81,"I wear a gun when I can tell a
client expects me to.  Other than
that, there's never any reason."
82,MRS CHRISTIAN,82,Just curious.
83,MRS CHRISTIAN,83,"My husband was the only one with the
combination to this safe.  I knew
about it, but as far as I was
concerned it was none of my
business.  Not till now, that is."
84,WELLES,84,"You hired someone to open it.  I'll
bet the lawyer loved that."
85,MRS CHRISTIAN,85,"There was nothing he could do.  My
husband left everything to me."
86,MRS CHRISTIAN,86,"I prevented anyone from seeing the
contents.  I felt these were my
husband's private things.  I
didn't... I didn't realize..."
87,WELLES,87,"Do you want to tell me what you
found?"
88,MRS CHRISTIAN,88,"Cash, stock certificates, and this..."
89,MRS CHRISTIAN,89,"It's a film... of a girl being
murdered."
90,WELLES,90,I'm afraid I don't...
91,MRS CHRISTIAN,91,"This is a movie showing a girl being
murdered.  She's sitting on a bed,
and a man rapes her... and he begins
to cut her with a knife..."
92,MRS CHRISTIAN,92,I only watched what I could.
93,MRS CHRISTIAN,93,"I didn't know what to think.  I
can't tell you how horrible it's
been, to know this belonged to my
husband.  To know that he watched
this... this atrocity.  But, I can't
go to the police..."
94,WELLES,94,"Mrs. Christian... please, will you
sit down a moment?"
95,WELLES,95,"I want you to listen carefully.
What you're talking about is a
""snuff film.""  But, from what I
know, snuff films are a kind of...
urban myth.  Like, red light
district folklore.  There's no such
thing, I can assure you."
96,WELLES,96,"Please, believe me.  This is
probably a stag film.  Simulated
rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might
seem real, but there are ways of
making it look realistic... fake
blood and special effects..."
97,MRS CHRISTIAN,97,No.
98,WELLES,98,"If you were to study it you'd see
the camera cutting away... you'd see
the tricks they can play..."
99,MRS CHRISTIAN,99,I'm telling you it's not that.
100,WELLES,100,I'm sure it is.
101,WELLES,101,"It's probably something your husband
was given as a bad joke.  More than
likely he never even watched it."
102,MRS CHRISTIAN,102,"Will you watch it and see for
yourself?"
103,WELLES,103,"Of course.  But, I'm certain it's
nothing to worry about."
104,WELLES,104,You... you need to go to the police.
105,MRS CHRISTIAN,105,"I told you I can't, not yet."
106,WELLES,106,You don't have any other choice.
107,MRS CHRISTIAN,107,"No.  For me to live with the ruin of
my husband's name, I need know that
whoever did this will be punished.
If you can find them, I will take
their names to the police.  I'll say
my husband confessed on his death
bed. I'll say I didn't have courage
to come forward at first..."
108,WELLES,108,It won't work like that.
109,MRS CHRISTIAN,109,"Any evidence you collect can be
given to the police later,
anonymously.  I've thought about it
and there's no other way.  If you
can't find them... if the only thing
that comes from this film is that
this is all my husband will be
remembered for, well I can't let
that happen.  I'm telling you I
won't.  If there's no chance that
poor girl's memory can be served,
then I'll just have to spend my last
days trying to forget her."
110,WELLES,110,"I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate
investigations..."
111,MRS CHRISTIAN,111,You've found missing persons before.
112,WELLES,112,Nothing remotely like this.
113,MRS CHRISTIAN,113,"I know what I'm asking.  Your
compensation will be appropriate to
the risk.  You'll need cash to buy
information, and I'll provide it."
114,MRS CHRISTIAN,114,"I feel responsible, Mr. Welles."
115,MRS CHRISTIAN,115,You saw what he did to her.
116,WELLES,116,"This is the mortgage.  This is
Cindy's college money."
117,AMY,117,I understand.
118,WELLES,118,"Sometimes you can't know what I'm
doing.  It's better that way."
119,AMY,119,I know.
120,WELLES,120,"It's a missing persons case... a
long shot.  I'll give it two months,
two months at most, then I'll be
back.  We'll take a vacation."
121,AMY,121,Why the gun?
122,WELLES,122,"I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even
wear it.  It's a precaution."
123,WELLES,123,Don't worry about me.
124,WELLES,124,"Hello, honey, it's me."
125,WELLES,125,"I'm fine, how are you?"
126,DIRECTOR,126,"What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?"
127,WELLES,127,Call me Tom.
128,DIRECTOR,128,"Alright, Tom."
129,WELLES,129,"What I'd like, very simply, is
access to your archive.  And, now I
understand this isn't something you
normally do for private citizens..."
130,DIRECTOR,130,"There are reasons for the way we do
things here."
131,WELLES,131,"Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by
whatever decision you make, but I'd
appreciate if you'll hear me out..."
132,WELLES,132,"Few days ago, I was contacted by a
couple living in Philadelphia, a
doctor and his wife.  What happened
was they picked up a young girl
hitchhiking off 81, which heads into
Philadelphia, started up a
conversation with this girl, she
looked homeless, seemed about
eighteen maybe.  They convinced her
to let them buy her a meal in the
city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have
much to say, but they got a sense
she's a runaway, so all through
dinner the doctor's working on her,
trying to convince her that at the
very least she should pick up a
telephone.  Not surprisingly, she
ate her food, excused herself..."
133,WELLES,133,"That's the last they saw her.  The
reason they came to me for help, the
reason I'm coming to you, is we had
a friend of mine in the department
work up a sketch..."
134,WELLES,134,"They want to see if I can I.D. this
girl, somehow pass along a message
to let the parents know the kid's
alive, doing alright."
135,DIRECTOR,135,"Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or
N.C.M.E.C.?"
136,WELLES,136,I figured you share information.
137,DIRECTOR,137,We do.
138,WELLES,138,"For whatever reasons I thought you
might be more receptive."
139,DIRECTOR,139,Why don't they come to me?
140,WELLES,140,"This doctor and wife, they're nice
people, but they don't want to get
too involved.  They're not trying to
have the parents come looking for
the girl either.
You and I both know sometimes, not
often, but sometimes there's real
reasons why a kid'll run.
Molestation, whatever.  Besides
that, the girl's probably eighteen,
so she's legal."
141,DIRECTOR,141,I'm not so sure about this.
142,WELLES,142,"They're putting themselves in place
of this kid's parents and thinking
they'd want to hear their girl's
okay, even if that's all they hear."
143,DIRECTOR,143,"I can give you my card, if your
clients want to call me..."
144,WELLES,144,"They were pretty clear they didn't
want this coming back on them."
145,DIRECTOR,145,"Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry."
146,WELLES,146,"Who knows... maybe she's already
given her parents a call, right?"
147,WELLES,147,Fuck.
148,DIRECTOR,148,"Excuse me... Tom, hold on..."
149,DIRECTOR,149,"Listen, maybe I can help after all.
Why don't you come on back in...
we'll see what we can do."
150,DIRECTOR,150,This is it.  It's not much.
151,DIRECTOR,151,"We've got less than five percent on
computer and we lose that funding in
December.  I'll have someone show it
to you anyway.  Other than that, I'm
afraid it's the wet thumb method."
152,DIRECTOR,152,"Files are mostly by state and year
of disappearance.  We try to keep
the children and adults separate.
No eating or smoking in here, but
there's a coffee machine in the hall."
153,WELLES,153,Any good?
154,DIRECTOR,154,"It's horrible, but it'll be your
best friend after a few days.  I
hope you realize what kind of long
shot you're chasing after."
155,WELLES,155,"You're gonna be seeing a lot of me.
You're sure you don't mind?"
156,DIRECTOR,156,It's good what you're doing.
157,WELLES,157,"Hello, Mrs. Christian?  Tom Welles.
Here's where we stand.  I checked
the film stock and it's called Supra-
lux 544.  The company that made that
stock discontinued it in '92..."
158,WELLES,158,"Yeah, about five or six years ago.
Anyway, do what you can to dig up
your husband's old financial
records, look for anything out of
the ordinary..."
159,"WELLES (V.O., cont)",159,"Nobody really uses eight millimeter
film anymore, so we can assume there
are reasons our guys did.  First,
they could develop it themselves if
they had any sort of expertise.
Obviously, this isn't the kind of
movie you can just drop off at the
one-hour photo..."
160,"WELLES (V.O., cont)",160,"Second, the film that went through
the camera is what we've got.
There's no negative.  Unlike video,
it wasn't meant to be duplicated.
No reason for them to risk having
more than one copy of their murder
floating around..."
161,"WELLES (V.O., cont)",161,"There don't seen to be many
fingerprints on the film itself, but
I'm going to have to be careful to
leave them intact..."
162,"WELLES (V.O., cont)",162,"It's okay for yours and your
husbands fingerprints to be on the
film, but you'll have to use me as
a middleman if you go to the police.
That way I don't have to explain why
my prints are on it..."
163,"WELLES (V.O., cont)",163,"There were three men.  Two are
obvious; the man in the mask and the
man running the camera, but I caught
a glimpse of a third man in a
mirror.  It's nothing that can be
used for identification, but he was
there, watching..."
164,"WELLES (V.O., cont)",164,"So, there were three.  They would
have kept it small, wouldn't have
let anyone in on it they didn't have
to.  That's all for now... except,
I feel I should tell you... with
this looking like it happened at
least five or six years ago..."
165,"WELLES (V.O., cont)",165,"Well, it's not very likely we'll
ever find out who this girl was."
166,"WELLES (V.O., cont)",166,"I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye."
167,MRS MATHEWS,167,Yes... ?
168,WELLES,168,"Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's
Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed
investigator..."
169,WELLES,169,"I've been hired as an independent
contractor by the U.S. Resource
Center for Missing Persons as part
of an internal audit.  If you have
any time over the next few days, I'd
like to make an appointment to ask
some questions about the
disappearance of your daughter."
170,MRS MATHEWS,170,"I don't understand, who are... ?"
171,WELLES,171,"I'm sorry, let me explain, the
R.C.M.P. is a support organization
and archive, not unlike the Center
for Missing and Exploited Children
in Washington.  I'm sure you've
dealt with them before?"
172,MRS MATHEWS,172,"Yes, but..."
173,WELLES,173,"These volunteer organizations are
sort of interconnected, functioning
hand in hand with law enforcement.
The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review
their investigations..."
174,WELLES,174,"... fact-check their records, see if
there's anything they missed,
anything they should be doing
different.  I'm here for a few days,
before I head back up to Virginia.
These reports go to the Justice
Department eventually.  I spoke to
your F.B.I. contact a few days ago,
uh..."
175,WELLES,175,"What was the name... ? I've got it
here somewhere..."
176,MRS MATHEWS,176,Neil... Neil Cole.
177,WELLES,177,"Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call
and let you know to expect me.  He
didn't call?"
178,MRS MATHEWS,178,No.
179,WELLES,179,"Well, I'm following up on your
daughter, Mary, height; five four,
weight; hundred ten pounds, brown
eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24,
1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A
runaway, that's how she's listed.
Is this information correct... ?"
180,WELLES,180,"I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy.
Is there a more convenient time... ?"
181,WELLES,181,"Can I buy you lunch, would that be
alright?"
182,WELLES,182,"It's very important you don't let
this raise your expectations.  It's
not going to effect any ongoing
efforts.  All I'm saying is, please
know, I'm not here to create any
false hope."
183,MRS MATHEWS,183,"They hired you.  You're like, a
private detective?"
184,WELLES,184,That's exactly what I am.
185,MRS MATHEWS,185,"I didn't think there were private
detectives anymore, except on TV."
186,WELLES,186,"You probably expect me to be wearing
a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking
whiskey, chasing women and getting
beaten up by guys with broken noses.
Want to know what it's really like?
It's sitting in a car and staring at
a hotel window for three days
straight, pissing in a plastic
bottle, pardon me, because some guy
thinks his wife's cheating on him.
Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who
hired you, he has a hair-lip,
dandruff and crooked teeth, and you
could have told him the minute you
laid eyes on him his wife's
cheating, and you don't blame her."
187,WELLES,187,"It's refreshing to actually sit down
and meet someone face to face,
someone nice like you."
188,WELLES,188,"So, she didn't leave a note?  She
never gave any indication where she
might go, before she left?"
189,MRS MATHEWS,189,No.
190,WELLES,190,She just seemed... depressed... ?
191,MRS MATHEWS,191,"She didn't seem herself.  For months
there never was any way to get her
to talk about it.  One night we went
to bed... the next morning she was
gone.  She took some clothes."
192,WELLES,192,What was she running from?
193,MRS MATHEWS,193,I don't know.
194,WELLES,194,"If there's anything you feel
uncomfortable talking about, tell
me, but I have to ask.  Your
husband... he committed suicide?"
195,MRS MATHEWS,195,Yes.
196,WELLES,196,"September 4th, 1993.  About a year
after Mary disappeared."
197,MRS MATHEWS,197,"We were divorced by then.  Things
fell apart... he was living with a
friend..."
198,WELLES,198,Why do you think he did it?
199,MRS MATHEWS,199,It got to be too much for him.
200,WELLES,200,"You have to forgive me, but in these
circumstances... with your
daughter..."
201,WELLES,201,"Were there any indications of... any
sort of abuse?"
202,MRS MATHEWS,202,"There wasn't anything like that.
The police and the FBI people asked,
but there wasn't anything happened
like that, never.  My husband... his
heart broke when Mary left..."
203,WELLES,203,I didn't mean to...
204,MRS MATHEWS,204,"You try going through what we did.
Bob couldn't take it, that's all.
Christ, there's times when it still
seems like I can't either."
205,WELLES,205,I had to ask.  I apologize.
206,MRS MATHEWS,206,"No one knows what it's like.  You
can't even imagine how much it hurts."
207,MRS MATHEWS,207,People remember me from the news.
208,MRS MATHEWS,208,Can you drive me back now?
209,WELLES,209,Of course.
210,MRS MATHEWS,210,This is her room.
211,MRS MATHEWS,211,"The police made a wreck of it, but
I put it back exactly how it was.
Just how she likes it."
212,MRS MATHEWS,212,"Those are for her birthday.  One for
every year she's missed.  They'll be
waiting for her when she comes back."
213,WELLES,213,"I... I shouldn't take anymore of
your time.  Maybe we can finish
tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow..."
214,MRS MATHEWS,214,Okay.
215,WELLES,215,"You should be able to take a shower
and still have hot water left, honey."
216,WELLES,216,"Call him back and tell him I said
so.  The goddamn thing's still under
warranty."
217,WELLES,217,"I'm okay.  It's hard here.  It's
hard."
218,WELLES,218,"I've got a lead I have to follow
through.  To be honest, I don't
think I'm going to get very far.
I miss you.  I love you."
219,MRS MATHEWS,219,"We weren't religious.  We never
forced religion down her throat,
like I've seen some parents do to
their kids.  We never made her go to
church.  But, after Mary was gone,
that's when I got religious."
220,MRS MATHEWS,220,"Doesn't make much sense, does it?
When everything's happy, when life's
fine and you have every reason to
believe there's a God, you don't
bother.  Then, something horrible
happens... that's when you start
praying all the time.  That's when
you start going to church."
221,WELLES,221,We're all like that.
222,MRS MATHEWS,222,Are you religious?
223,WELLES,223,No.
224,MRS MATHEWS,224,You should be.
225,WELLES,225,"I've got what I need for my report.
There is... there is one thing that
bothers me though."
226,MRS MATHEWS,226,What?
227,WELLES,227,"It's not really my place, but it's
not easy for me to set aside the
private detective part of me either.
See, I know a little about missing
persons.  When kids run, they almost
always leave a note.  It's guilt.
They want to say goodbye."
228,MRS MATHEWS,228,There wasn't one.  The police looked.
229,WELLES,229,"Do you think the police did a good
job?"
230,MRS MATHEWS,230,I don't know.  I think so.
231,WELLES,231,"It is possible... and I know this
isn't something you want to hear.
Your daughter may have tried to hide
a note where she thought you would
eventually find it, but where she
knew your husband would never find
it.  She might have wanted to tell
you something..."
232,MRS MATHEWS,232,"No.  You don't have any reason to
think that..."
233,WELLES,233,"If the police focused their search
in"
234,WELLES,234,"that'd be only natural, but they may
have been looking in the wrong place."
235,MRS MATHEWS,235,How... how can you say that to me...?
236,WELLES,236,Will you let me look?
237,MRS MATHEWS,237,"My husband never laid a hand on her.
She would have told me... she would
have told me..."
238,WELLES,238,"You're probably right, and I
probably won't find anything.
I don't have a right to ask this,
and you can kick me out of your
house if you want, but this is my
profession and there's a part of me
that can't let it go.  Police are
just as human as you or I.  They
could have missed something.  They
probably didn't."
239,WELLES,239,Wouldn't you rather know?
240,MRS MATHEWS,240,"Go ahead and look if you want.  I
don't care what you do."
241,MARY'S VOICE (V.O.),241,"""Dear mom.  If you're reading this,
it means I called you from

it down here.  You know I haven't
been happy for a long, long time.

things I couldn't tell you.  He's

choose, between her being out there,
living a good life and being happy,

350,LARGE MAN,350,You have to pay to come in here.
351,MAX,351,"You've got Penthouse, Playboy,
Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers
them pornography anymore.  Then,
there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple
X.  The difference is penetration.
That's hardcore.  That whole
industry's up in the valley.
Writers, directors, porn stars.
They're celebrities, or they think
they are.  They pump out 150 videos
a week.  A"
352,MAX,352,"a porno Academy Awards.  America
loves pornography.  Anybody tells
you they never use pornography,
they're lying.  Somebody's buying
those videos.  Somebody's out there
spending 900 million dollars a year
on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's
only gonna get worse.  More and more
you'll see perverse hardcore coming
into the mainstream, because that's
evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my
God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his
hips, how offensive!  Nowadays,
Mtv's showing girls dancing around
in thong bikinis with their asses
hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For
the porn-addict, big tits aren't big
enough after a while.  They have to
be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn
chicks are putting in breast
implants bigger than your head,
literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be
Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler,
Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore
films'll be medical films.
People'll be jerking off to women
laying around with open wounds.
There's nowhere else for it to go."
353,WELLES,353,Interesting theory.
354,MAX,354,"What you saw tonight, we're not
talking about a video some dentist
takes home over the weekend.  We're
talking about stuff where people get
hurt.  Specialty product."
355,WELLES,355,Child pornography.
356,MAX,356,"There's two kinds of specialty
product; legal and illegal.  Foot
fetish, shit films, watersports,
bondage, spanking, fisting, she-
males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond
hardcore, but legal.  This is the
kind of hardcore where one guy's
going to look at it and throw up,
another guy looks at it and falls in
love.  Now, with some of the S+M and
bondage films, they straddle the
line.  How are you supposed to tell
if the person tied up with the ball
gag in their mouth is a consenting
or not?  Step over that line, you're
into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but
there aren't many.  I've never seen
one."
357,WELLES,357,Snuff films.
358,MAX,358,"I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't
yanking you around.  There's no such
thing."
359,WELLES,359,"What other ways are there to get
illegal films?  Who do you see?"
360,MAX,360,"First of all, basement sales like
tonight aren't gonna last much
longer.  It's too risky, one, and
two, everything's going on the
internet.  Anyone with a computer
and enough patience can find
anything he wants.  It's heaven for
those degenerate chicken-hawks.
They're swapping pictures back and
forth as fast as their modems can
zap 'em.  But, there's still some
weird shit under the counter where
I work sometimes.  No one knows where
it comes from.  That's local
underground, where information
spreads by word of mouth.  Those are
zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their
hands are permanently pruned.  They
go out in the sun they don't burn,
they blister.  Other than that, all
I know about is the mail.
Classified ads in the paper with
hidden codes.  Secret couriers.
Credit card orders to dummy
corporations.  Interstate wire
transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes.
But, if you're asking me who do you
go to to get illegal shit... who
knows?  That's the whole point --
the seller stays as far away from
the buyer as possible, and vice
versa, and cops can't trace the
deal.  There's ways to do it so
nobody knows who anybody is."
361,WELLES,361,How old are you?
362,MAX,362,Twenty-five.
363,WELLES,363,Where are your parents?
364,MAX,364,"I don't know, where are yours?"
365,WELLES,365,"I don't mean any offense... but what
are you doing mixed up in all this?"
366,MAX,366,"I'm not mixed up in anything,
hayseed.  What are you talking about?"
367,WELLES,367,"You just strike me as smart enough
to be doing something else."
368,MAX,368,"Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What
choices have I got?  Fuck, just
because I know about stuff like
tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I
work a job.  It beats pumping gas,
beats making hamburgers."
369,WELLES,369,"You're telling me it doesn't get to
you?"
370,MAX,370,"You can't sit there all day watching
the parade of losers that comes into
that place without going numb.  So
what?
Am I gonna go off and be a race car
driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for
President?  What about you, pops?"
371,WELLES,371,What about me?

373,WELLES,373,A daughter.

376,MRS CHRISTIAN,376,"My husband had five cash accounts he
used to temporarily hold stock
profits.  Between November of 1991

didn't return one night.  She never
came back.  I didn't know what to
think..."
399,NUN,399,Do you know what happened to her?
400,WELLES,400,"I'm trying to find out.  She was a
runaway.  I'm looking into it for
her parents."
401,NUN,401,Can you get that down for me?
402,NUN,402,"No, the next shelf... there..."
403,WELLES,403,What is this?
404,NUN,404,Those are her belongings.
405,WELLES,405,Her belongings?

forgotten it, till you showed me
her picture."

you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I
adored her.  I supposed I always
hoped she'd be back.  After a time,

their head.  Till then, fuck you."
432,EDDIE (V.O.),432,Fuck you!
433,EDDIE (V.O.),433,Celebrity Films.
434,WELLES (V.O.),434,Eddie.
435,EDDIE (V.O.),435,"Yeah, who's this?"
436,WELLES (V.O.),436,I know what you did.
437,EDDIE (V.O.),437,What?
438,WELLES (V.O.),438,I know what you did.
439,EDDIE (V.O.),439,Who is this.
440,WELLES (V.O.),440,"You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six
years ago..."
441,EDDIE (V.O.),441,What the fuck are you.. ?
442,WELLES (V.O.),442,"You killed that girl and you put it
on film.  You and your pals, you're
fucked.  You fucked up real good."
443,WELLES,443,"Come on, Eddie..."
444,WELLES (O.S.),444,... come on...
445,MAN'S VOICE (V.O.),445,... Hello?
446,EDDIE (V.O.),446,"Dino, it's Eddie... Eddie Poole..."
447,DINO (V.O.),447,What do you want?
448,EDDIE (V.O.),448,"I just got a call... two seconds
ago, some motherfucker called...
says he knows about the loop."
449,DINO (V.O.),449,What are you talking about?
450,EDDIE (V.O.),450,"The loop!  The girl we did, what the
fuck do you think I'm talking
about?!  This guy calls and says he
knows about the fucking loop..."
451,DINO (V.O.),451,Bullshit.
452,EDDIE (V.O.),452,I'm telling you...
453,DINO (V.O.),453,"Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's
impossible.  Why are you bothering
me with this... ?"
454,EDDIE (V.O.),454,"Because somebody just fucking called
me and fucking laid it out!"
455,DINO (V.O.),455,"There's nothing there, you brain-
dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's
absolutely no way in this world to
connect us to anything.  I want you
to hang the phone up, and if you
call me about this again I'm going
to send a friend of mine out there
and have him crack you open with a
fucking rib spreader."
456,EDDIE (V.O.),456,Dino...
457,DINO (V.O),457,Nobody knows anything.
458,WELLES,458,"That is you, isn't it, Eddie?"
459,WELLES VOICE (V.O.),459,"... and your pals, you're fucked..."
460,WELLES,460,Two one two.
461,WELLES,461,"What do you know about a guy called
Dino Velvet?  Dino Velvet Films?"
462,MAX,462,"Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the
John Luc Godard of S+M flicks,
supposed to be a real weirdo."
463,WELLES (V.O.),463,"A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd
have thought it?"
464,MAX,464,"His stuff comes out of New York.
Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic
Hardcore.  Definitely not for the
squeamish."
465,WELLES (V.O.),465,Specialty product.
466,MAX,466,You're learning.
467,WELLES (V.O.),467,Where does he sell it?
468,MAX,468,"Out of the back of bondage magazines
mostly, but you can find it on the
street if you look.  He'll also do
commissions, for enough money..."
469,MAX (V.O.),469,"Nothing illegal, it's always
borderline.  Like if some freak
wants to see a transvestite in a
full rubber immersion suit getting
an enema from a..."
470,WELLES,470,"Alright, I get the picture."
471,MAX (V.O.),471,"He cuts all kinds of other stuff
into his movies; photographs,
newsreel footage, subliminal images.
Thinks he's making art."
472,WELLES,472,"Well, I'm in New York now.  What do
you say to flying out and giving me
a hand?"
473,MAX (V.O.),473,"I'm a working stiff, pops."
474,WELLES,474,"Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four
hundred a day, plus expenses."
475,MAX (V.O.),475,"You want me to come out there and
play private eye?"
476,WELLES,476,"Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up
whatever Dino Velvet films you can.
Get receipts.  I'll call back."
477,MAX (V.O.),477,See ya.
478,MRS CHRISTIAN,478,Hello?
479,WELLES (V.O.),479,"Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here."
480,MRS CHRISTIAN,480,How are you?  Having any luck?
481,WELLES (V.O.),481,"I don't know if luck's the word.
Are you feeling alright?"
482,MRS CHRISTIAN,482,"I've been ordered into bed.  The
doctor says I've gotten the flu, or
some other wretched ailment."
483,WELLES (V.O.),483,I hope it's nothing serious.
484,MRS CHRISTIAN,484,"Nothing more than a bother.  Have
you any news for me?"
485,WELLES,485,"I've made progress.  I'm in
Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces
fall into place, I'll drive to you
and give you an update."
486,MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.),486,Fine...
487,WELLES,487,"I've got about five thousand left in
cash, but I'll need another thirty,
if you approve."
488,MRS CHRISTIAN,488,How will I get it to you?
489,WELLES,489,"If you have a pencil and paper, I'll
tell you how to send it."
490,MAX,490,"You didn't say it was gonna be this
luxurious."
491,WELLES,491,It's their Presidential Suite.
492,MAX,492,Great.
493,MAX,493,"Oh, come on, man, what are we doing
in this flea bag?"
494,WELLES,494,"It's cheap, and people know to mind
their own business. What have you
got for me?"
495,MAX,495,Dino Velvet.
496,WELLES,496,Max... wake up...
497,MAX,497,Wha... ?
498,WELLES,498,"Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?"
499,MAX,499,"He's one of the lunatics Dino uses.
He's in a bunch of these."
500,MAX,500,"Why?  He have something to do with
whatever you're into?"
501,WELLES,501,No... it's nothing... that's not him.
502,WELLES,502,Who is he?
503,MAX,503,"I told you, he's one of Dino
Velvet's stock players..."
504,WELLES,504,"Who is he, his"
505,MAX,505,"Nobody knows his name.  That's his
thing.  He always wears a mask.  You
never see his face.  He calls
himself ""Machine,"" that's what they
call him.  Machine."
506,MAX,506,"They say he's half brain-dead from
all the steroids he's using."
507,MAX,507,"He's a brutal motherfucker, man.  He
loves what he does for a living."
508,WELLES,508,You don't need to be here.
509,MAX,509,"What kind of Junior P.I. would I be
if I didn't go with you?"
510,MAN'S VOICE (V.O.),510,Who is it?
511,THUG,511,You're in the wrong place.
512,WELLES,512,We're looking for Mr. Velvet.
513,THUG,513,He's not here.
514,WELLES,514,"Why don't you tell him we're here to
give him a large sum of money.  If
he's not interested, we'll go."
515,THUG,515,"You should leave now, before I have
to remove you."
516,DINO VELVET'S VOICE (V.O.),516,"Show them in, Milo."
517,WELLES,517,"You heard the boss, Milo."
518,DINO VELVET,518,Come in.  Make yourself comfortable.
519,WELLES,519,"It's an honor to meet you.  Thank
you for seeing us."
520,DINO VELVET,520,What can I do for you today?
521,WELLES,521,"I'd like to commission a work.  I'm
a great admirer of yours."
522,DINO VELVET,522,"Flattering.  And, who's your
colorful little chum?"
523,WELLES,523,A fellow investor.
524,DINO VELVET,524,Hmm.
525,MAX,525,"You're the only one still shooting
film and transferring it to video.
Nobody appreciates that kind of
integrity anymore... the grain, the
gritty look you get."
526,DINO VELVET,526,"Well, I'm glad you appreciate it."
527,DINO VELVET,527,"What would you say is your favorite
piece?"
528,MAX,528,"I know if I had to pick, it'd be
""Choke,"" or ""Devil."""
529,WELLES,529,"""Devil"" frightened me as much as it
excited me, but I'd be hard pressed
to choose a favorite."
530,DINO VELVET,530,You said something about money.
531,WELLES,531,"Yes.  What we're looking for is
rather specific."
532,WELLES,532,That's five thousand dollars.
533,DINO VELVET,533,Is it?
534,WELLES,534,"Five thousand now, five thousand on
delivery.
Two women, one white and one black,
as long as they have large breasts.
Hard bondage, or course.  Other than
that, trusting your artistic
interpretation, I have only two
stipulations."
535,DINO VELVET,535,And they are?
536,WELLES,536,I want to watch you work.
537,DINO VELVET,537,I'll consider it.
538,WELLES,538,"And the other performer... it has to
be that monster you use... the man
in the mask."
539,DINO VELVET,539,Machine.
540,WELLES,540,"If it's not him, there's no deal."
541,DINO VELVET,541,"He might be interested... but it
would mean another five thousand."
542,WELLES,542,We can do that.
543,DINO VELVET,543,"Well, well, I'll have to put my
thinking-cap on about all this.
You'll leave the money as a deposit?"
544,DINO VELVET,544,Very good.
545,DINO VELVET,545,"You have a beautiful face... the way
the light hits it.  I'd like to take
your picture.  You don't mind?"
546,WELLES,546,I'd rather you didn't.
547,DINO VELVET,547,What's the problem?
548,WELLES,548,I'm camera shy.
549,DINO VELVET,549,"You trust me to keep your money, but
not to take your picture?"
550,WELLES,550,"Those are two different kinds of
trust."
551,WELLES,551,"Thank you for your time.  I hope we
can do business."
552,WELLES,552,"So, what do you say?"
553,DINO VELVET,553,"I'll do this for you.  Fifteen
thousand dollars."
554,WELLES (V.O.),554,Machine's in?
555,DINO VELVET,555,He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
556,DINO VELVET (V.O.),556,"Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three
o'clock, tomorrow."
557,WELLES,557,Where's that?
558,DINO VELVET (V.O.),558,Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
559,MAX,559,What's next?
560,WELLES,560,"I'm trying to figure that out
myself.  I have to see Machine
without his mask."
561,MAX,561,"Still don't want to tell me what
you're doing?"
562,WELLES,562,Nope.
563,WELLES,563,This is for you.
564,MAX,564,What's this?
565,WELLES,565,"It's money.  People use it to
purchase goods and services."
566,MAX,566,"Look... that's awful generous and
everything..."
567,WELLES,567,"It's not my money.  The woman I got
it from is never going to give it a
second thought.  Let's not make a
big deal out of this, okay?"
568,WELLES,568,"Go be a race car driver.  Go run for
President.  Whatever."
569,WELLES,569,I'll see you around.
570,DINO VELVET,570,There you are.  Come join us.
571,WELLES,571,Hello.
572,DINO VELVET,572,You brought the money?
573,WELLES,573,Right here.
574,DINO VELVET,574,Excellent.
575,WELLES,575,Where are the women?
576,DINO VELVET,576,They should be here any minute.
577,WELLES,577,What are these for?
578,DINO VELVET,578,"Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just
props.  Nice, aren't they?"
579,WELLES,579,Sure.
580,DINO VELVET,580,"Machine and I were just talking
about knifes.  The beauty of
knifes..."
581,DINO VELVET,581,"He was saying how fascinated he is
by their simple ability to be sharp.
The ability of a piece of metal to
be so thin that it is almost
nothing..."
582,DINO VELVET,582,"So close to nothingness that it cuts
with minimum effort, because it's so
non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It
blooms open as the blade widens, but
by then it's too late, because the
knife's already doing its pure,
simple damage."
583,DINO VELVET,583,"Ah, ours guests have arrived."
584,DINO VELVET,584,"Mister Welles... would you be so
kind as to remove any firearms from
your person?"
585,WELLES,585,What are you... ?
586,DINO VELVET,586,Take out your gun!
587,DINO VELVET,587,Slowly.  Let me see it.
588,DINO VELVET,588,"Empty the gun onto the table, very
carefully."
589,WELLES,589,"Look, I don't know what this..."
590,DINO VELVET,590,"Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say,
or I'll put this arrow through your
throat."
591,EDDIE,591,Is that him?
592,DINO VELVET,592,"Put the gun down, take the
handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the
bed."
593,DINO VELVET,593,"Didn't know what to make of you at
first, and you certainly had Eddie
on pins and needles.  But, lo and
behold, from out of the blue came an
old business acquaintance to explain
everything..."
594,EDDIE,594,"This is the fucker?  Motherfucker,
doesn't look like anything..."
595,EDDIE,595,Doesn't look like shit.
596,DINO VELVET,596,"You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?"
597,WELLES,597,I remember him.
598,LONGDALE,598,Let's get this over with.
599,DINO VELVET,599,Fine idea.
600,DINO VELVET,600,"You're going to go get the film you
received from Mrs. Christian, bring
it here and put it in my hand.  And
to save time, so we make this as
efficient as possible, there's an
incentive..."
601,WELLES,601,No...
602,DINO VELVET,602,Friend of yours?
603,WELLES,603,"Look, he's got nothing to do with
this... let him go..."
604,DINO VELVET,604,"Can you guess what I'm going to say
next?"
605,WELLES,605,"He doesn't know anything... he's got
nothing to do with this..."
606,DINO VELVET,606,"Bring the film, or we kill him."
607,WELLES,607,"I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit
box, in the city..."
608,DINO VELVET,608,"How cooperative.  Longdale will keep
you company."
609,DINO VELVET,609,"Don't let Longdale's questionable
choice of weapon give you any ideas.
If his fey little gun puts enough
little holes in you, you'll be just
as dead... and so will Max."
610,EDDIE,610,"Move it, dirtbag... !"
611,DINO VELVET,611,Do hurry.
612,WELLES,612,"You were the middleman, am I right?
Old man Christian wasn't about to go
shopping for a snuff film himself."
613,LONGDALE,613,"Wouldn't exactly have been possible
for a man of his stature."
614,WELLES,614,"So, he sent you, gave you the money,
his errand-boy.  And if you refused,
it wasn't like you could tell anyone
your pervert boss just asked you to
get him a snuff film.  That's the
beauty of lawyer/client privilege."
615,LONGDALE,615,"That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted
me implicitly."
616,WELLES,616,"Must have paid you a lot, for you to
risk everything.  Would've had to
have cut yourself a real nice piece
of money."
617,LONGDALE,617,I was well compensated.
618,WELLES,618,"That's why you got scared when Mrs.
Christian hired me.  You knew about
the film, figured it had to be in
that safe.  How'd you find me?"
619,LONGDALE,619,Never mind how I found you.
620,WELLES,620,"Followed me... must have freaked out
when you saw me closing in on your
buddies..."
621,LONGDALE,621,They're no friends of mine.
622,WELLES,622,"Except, you're willing commit murder
with them."
623,LONGDALE,623,"None of this would be happening if
you would have left it alone.  If
you weren't digging up a girl who
died six years ago.  A girl no one
even remembers."
624,WELLES,624,"Mary Anne Mathews, that was her
name.  Her mom remembers her."
625,WELLES,625,"You found these smut dealers and
asked to buy a snuff film, right?
Wanted them to find you one.  Well,
they didn't"
626,WELLES,626,they went out and
627,LONGDALE,627,Shut up.
628,WELLES,628,"Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you
paid money to have her murdered."
629,LONGDALE,629,Shut your mouth and drive!
630,WELLES,630,"Did it get him off, huh, watching
them cut her up?  Tell me, because
I really want to understand.  Did he
jerk off to it?  You watch it with
him, sit there giving him a handjob
while you both watched... ?"
631,LONGDALE,631,You're making me very angry.
632,WELLES,632,"Just tell me.  Tell me some more of
the secrets you and Christian
shared. What kind of degenerate
pervert was he really?  What the
fuck did he want with a snuff film?"
633,LONGDALE,633,You're asking me why?
634,WELLES,634,I'm asking.
635,LONGDALE,635,"A man like Mr. Christian, a great
man... all his money, all his
power... a man who attained
everything there was to attain..."
636,WELLES,636,"Why did he buy a film of some poor,
lost girl getting butchered?"
637,LONGDALE,637,Isn't it incredibly obvious?
638,WELLES,638,Enlighten me.
639,LONGDALE,639,"Because he could.  He did it because
he could."
640,LONGDALE,640,"What other reason were you looking
for?"
641,LONGDALE,641,"You've got four minutes till I call
Mr. Velvet and let him know there's
a problem."
642,MANAGER,642,May I show you to a booth...
643,WELLES,643,"No, I've got it."
644,LONGDALE,644,You almost went over your limit.
645,WELLES,645,Fuck you.
646,LONGDALE,646,Give me the film.
647,WELLES,647,You'll get it when we get there.
648,LONGDALE,648,Give me the film.
649,WELLES,649,"Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try
driving to Brooklyn with my brains
all over the windshield."
650,WELLES,650,No!!
651,WELLES,651,You fuckers!
652,EDDIE,652,You're a dead man.
653,DINO VELVET,653,Leave him alone.
654,EDDIE,654,Fuck off.
655,EDDIE,655,What the fuck... !
656,DINO,656,I promised him to Machine.
657,EDDIE,657,... sorry...
658,DINO VELVET,658,"First things first.  You might want
to watch this, Mr. Welles..."
659,WELLES,659,Don't... please...
660,DINO VELVET,660,"And so it ends.  It's as if she
never existed."
661,DINO VELVET,661,"Don't blame yourself.  You were in
way over your head."
662,WELLES,662,"Motherfuckers.  Small time,
motherfuckers... !  Tell me
something..."
663,WELLES,663,"I know why you did it, Dino,
Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do
it?  Must have been a helluva lot of
money, right?  One fuckload of
money..."
664,WELLES,664,"So, what are you all still doing
small time, huh?  What are you still
doing in the sewer, Eddie?!
Christian gave Longdale a million
dollars to find him a snuff film.
How much did you ever see... ?"
665,EDDIE,665,What's he talking about?
666,WELLES,666,"One million dollars, Dino.  How much
did he tell you he had..."
667,LONGDALE,667,He's lying.
668,WELLES,668,"Look at him.  You think he played it
square?  How much did he give you,
how much did he keep for himself?"
669,EDDIE,669,What the fuck's he talking about?
670,LONGDALE,670,Stay away from me.
671,DINO VELVET,671,"What's going on, Longdale?  Did this
happen?"
672,EDDIE,672,"You sell us short, you fuck?"
673,LONGDALE,673,"Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie,
show it to me.  Now!"
674,LONGDALE,674,"Put it on the ground, kick it here..."
675,EDDIE,675,You fucking lawyer...
676,LONGDALE,676,Move back!  All of you... move!
677,DINO VELVET,677,What were you thinking?
678,LONGDALE,678,"Back off!  Everything's been taken
care of, and I'm leaving now..."
679,DINO VELVET,679,"You're not going anywhere if you
fucked us, lawyer."
680,LONGDALE,680,I'm leaving.
681,EDDIE,681,"You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna
kill us all, is that it?"
682,DINO VELVET,682,You betrayed us.
683,LONGDALE,683,Stay where you are!
684,LONGDALE,684,Keep back!
685,DINO VELVET,685,You're not gonna live through this.
686,LONGDALE,686,"Our business is done, I'm leaving,
no one's going to stop me..."
687,DINO VELVET,687,Fuck you!
688,EDDIE,688,Fuck.
689,MACHINE (O.S.),689,NO!
690,MACHINE,690,He's mine!
691,WELLES,691,"No, no, no... please, don't kill
me... please... !"
692,EDDIE,692,Do him good.
693,WELLES,693,"Back off, Eddie..."
694,WELLES,694,Stop Eddie!
695,WELLES,695,"I swear to Christ I'll shoot you in
the back... !"
696,WELLES,696,"Come back, or I put a hole in him."
697,WELLES,697,"You might make it to your gun, but
not before I shoot Machine.  And if
I have to shoot him because of you,
and I don't kill him, right after he
kills me, he's gonna kill you."
698,WELLES,698,Take off the mask.
699,WELLES,699,Take it off!
700,MACHINE,700,You got one bullet.
701,MACHINE,701,"The only choice you have now, is
which one of us kills you."
702,MACHINE,702,Get the gun!
703,AMY,703,Hello?
704,WELLES (V.O.),704,"Amy, it's me.  Listen very
carefully.."
705,AMY,705,Tom?  Where have you been... ?
706,WELLES,706,"Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and
get out of the house.  Do it now.
Go to a hotel and stay there..."
707,AMY (V.O.),707,What's wrong?  Are you alright?
708,WELLES,708,"I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't
explain.  Don't use the phone, just
pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my
way.  I'll be back at the house in
three hours.  Call me from the hotel
when you get there"
709,AMY (V.O.),709,... What's going on?
710,WELLES,710,"Just do it, Amy, please, go."
711,WELLES,711,Honey... ?
712,MACHINE (V.O.),712,Not quite.
713,MACHINE (V.O.),713,"Nothing like getting home after a
rough day.  Home sweet home."
714,MACHINE (V.O.),714,"Walk away.  Pack your bags, put the
wife and kid in the car and find a
place to hide.  If you're lucky,
you'll never see me again."
715,WELLES,715,I don't know if I can do that.
716,MACHINE (V.O.),716,"I know who you are.  I know where
you live.  I know everything I need
to know to find you."
717,MACHINE (V.O.),717,Who am I?
718,AMY,718,What happened to you?
719,WELLES,719,"I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you
alright?"
720,AMY,720,"What's going on, Tom?  What happened?"
721,WELLES,721,"I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I
can't.  You have to trust me..."
722,AMY,722,Tom...
723,WELLES,723,"It has to be this way for now.  It
won't be long."
724,AMY,724,"Why haven't you called?  Why don't
you answer your phone?"
725,WELLES,725,I don't know.  I'm sorry...
726,AMY,726,"You're sorry?  What was I supposed
to think?"
727,AMY,727,"You owe me an explanation.  You
can't treat me like this."
728,WELLES,728,I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
729,AMY,729,You couldn't?
730,WELLES,730,You don't understand...
731,AMY,731,"No, I don't, because you're not
telling me anything!"
732,WELLES,732,"I was in hell.  If I called you...
if I heard your voice... it would
have been so easy for me to quit.
I couldn't do that."
733,AMY,733,You should have.
734,WELLES,734,"Amy, I'm not going to let anything
happen to us."
735,AMY,735,"Look where we are.  Look at
yourself.  You son of a bitch,
you don't have any idea what
you're putting me through..."
736,WELLES,736,I don't know what to say
737,AMY,737,You're killing me...
738,WELLES,738,Don't...
739,AMY,739,"What was I supposed to think
happened to you?!"
740,WELLES,740,Amy...
741,WELLES,741,Forgive me.
742,WELLES,742,"We have to stay here a few days.
I'll get more clothing from the
house if I can.  I'm sorry."
743,WELLES,743,We're going to be okay.
744,AMY,744,Who are you calling?
745,WELLES,745,Mrs. Christian.
746,AMY,746,What?
747,WELLES,747,"She's all I've got.  She's the only
witness."
748,AMY,748,Tom... she's dead.
749,AMY,749,"She died in her sleep three days
ago.  It was in the paper..."
750,WELLES,750,I just talked to her.
751,AMY,751,How could you not know?
752,AMY,752,Promise you'll stay.
753,WELLES,753,"Promise you won't go back there,
wherever you were.  Whatever it was,
forget it."
754,AMY,754,Promise me.
755,WELLES,755,I promise.
756,WELLES,756,"Hello, Eddie."
757,WELLES,757,Put your hands on your head.
758,WELLES,758,"Put your hands behind your head,
lock your finger together, get down
on your knees."
759,WELLES,759,I owe you a few.
760,WELLES,760,Don't go anywhere.
761,EDDIE,761,I'm gonna kill you.
762,WELLES,762,Don't bore me with that bullshit.
763,EDDIE,763,How'd you find me here?
764,WELLES,764,Don't ask questions.
765,EDDIE,765,Fuck you!
766,WELLES,766,Starting to recognize a pattern?
767,EDDIE,767,What do you want?
768,WELLES,768,Who is Machine?
769,EDDIE,769,I don't know...
770,WELLES,770,I want his name.
771,EDDIE,771,"I told you, I don't know."
772,WELLES,772,"I will never get tired of hurting
you, Eddie, so you might want to
change your attitude."
773,EDDIE,773,"What the fuck am I gonna protect
that freak for?  He was Dino's boy,
not mine.  He shows up with his mask
on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody
knows."
774,WELLES,774,"Okay, we'll come back to that.  So,
six years ago a guy contacts you,
through the classifieds, over the
phone, however he does it.  It's
Longdale, looking for a snuff film.
And you, entrepreneur that you are,
tell him you can hook him up."
775,EDDIE,775,"Yeah, the fucking lawyer."
776,WELLES,776,"Told him you could get him a snuff
film."
777,EDDIE,777,Yeah.
778,WELLES,778,How much did he pay you?
779,EDDIE,779,"Thirty thousand each, that fucking
cocksucker."
780,WELLES,780,"That's all?  Thirty each.  That's
all it took for you to murder her?"
781,EDDIE,781,It was a lot of fucking money.
782,WELLES,782,"So... you brought Dino in, and he
brought Machine.  And, one day, a
girl walked into your office because
you had an ad in the paper for
models.  And she never walked out."
783,EDDIE,783,Something like that.
784,WELLES,784,"What did you do, knock her out,
shoot her up... ?"
785,EDDIE,785,What the fuck do you want from me?
786,WELLES,786,"I want to know.  I want to know
exactly what you did to her!"
787,EDDIE,787,"Fuck you then, you want to know?  I
talked her up, told her how
beautiful she was, told her she was
gonna be a star.  I told her I was
gonna get her a screen test, and
while I'm doing that, I got her a
soda and dropped a mickey.  When it
was dark enough, I rang Dino and
told him it was go time, I put her
in the trunk of my car and we went
and we fucking did it.  That's what
happened.  She's dead.  She's been
dead a long fucking time.  Nobody
fucking cares!"
788,EDDIE,788,"You wanted to know, now you know."
789,EDDIE,789,"That's right, motherfucker, cut me
loose.  Be a man."
790,WELLES,790,Show me!
791,WELLES,791,"Show me where you did it, on the
map, exactly where you did it."
792,EDDIE,792,Why?
793,WELLES,793,Because we're going there.
794,EDDIE,794,What are we doing here?
795,WELLES,795,"That night... you didn't have to be
in the room, but you were."
796,WELLES,796,Why?  Why did you watch?
797,EDDIE,797,"I don't know.  I felt like it.  I
never saw anyone get done before."
798,WELLES,798,You enjoy it?
799,EDDIE,799,"Made me sick, but what did I care?
What did I care if some hump wants
to beat off to that.  It was just
something I was doing for money."
800,WELLES,800,Tell me what happened.
801,EDDIE,801,"What do you want to know?  You saw
it, you saw the loop..."
802,WELLES,802,Nobody saw you bring her in?
803,EDDIE,803,"There wasn't nobody around.  This
place was a shit-hole.  I backed up
the car to the door and we carried
her in, like groceries.  Dino made
her eat a bunch of pills, we laid
out the plastic, put film in the
camera and Machine went to work."
804,WELLES,804,What did you do with her body?
805,EDDIE,805,"Took it out the bathroom window.
Buried it in the woods."
806,WELLES,806,Show me.
807,EDDIE,807,"What are you thinking you're gonna
do... ?"
808,WELLES,808,Keep moving.
809,EDDIE,809,"Where do you think you're taking
this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero,
avenge that little girl's death?
Gonna make everything right with the
world?  How you gonna do that... ?"
810,EDDIE,810,"You can't go to the cops.  All you
can do is cut me loose and walk
away, because you got nothing..."
811,WELLES,811,Stop talking.
812,EDDIE,812,You got absolute zero.
813,WELLES,813,Show me where you buried her.
814,EDDIE,814,I don't know...
815,EDDIE,815,... out there somewhere.
816,WELLES,816,Where?  Show me where.
817,EDDIE,817,"I fucking don't know.  What do you
think... we weren't burying
treasure.  We didn't pace it out so
we could come back and get it.  We
dug a hole and we put her in it.
Your guess is as good as mine."
818,EDDIE,818,"You'll never find her.  Nobody ever
will, and even if they did, it
doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the
cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em
all.  Without the film, it never
happened.  Don't you get it?  It's
over.  You can't do anything."
819,WELLES,819,"I can kill you.  I can leave you out
here, just like you left her."
820,EDDIE,820,Do it.
821,WELLES,821,Don't think I won't.
822,EDDIE,822,"Do it!  Put me out of my misery so
I don't have to listen to you
whining anymore.  You think it's so
easy?"
823,WELLES,823,Easy enough for you.
824,EDDIE,824,I never killed anyone.
825,WELLES,825,"That's right, you just stood there
and watched, because you ""felt like
it.""  Almost makes you worse."
826,EDDIE,826,"What do you want?  You want me to
fall to my knees and start crying
like a baby... ?"
827,EDDIE,827,"Where you going?  You're the one
with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless
enough?  Come on..."
828,EDDIE,828,"Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with
that gun, your gun, right,
registered in your name?  Dig the
hole yourself, with your bare hands,
bury the body with your bullets in
it.  Fucking do it!"
829,EDDIE,829,You pussy.
830,EDDIE,830,Fucking pussy!
831,MRS MATHEWS (V.O.),831,Hello... ?
832,WELLES,832,"Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you
remember, I was there a few weeks
ago... asking about your daughter..."
833,MRS MATHEWS (V.O.),833,I remember.  You just left...
834,WELLES,834,"I have to tell you something.  It
won't be easy for you to hear.  It's
about your daughter... Mary Anne..."
835,WELLES,835,"When I... when I was there with you,
her diary, in your attic, in
silverware.  If you read it, you'll
know what I'm telling you is true..."
836,MRS MATHEWS (V.O.),836,What are you talking about... ?
837,WELLES,837,"She went to California, to Los
Angeles... she wanted to start over.
She wanted to be an actress..."
838,MRS MATHEWS (V.O.),838,What... ?
839,WELLES,839,"Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead.
She's dead."
840,MRS MATHEWS,840,Who is this... ?
841,WELLES,841,"Someone... some men, they took your
daughter and they drugged her, and
they took her to a motel room...
they did terrible things to her..."
842,MRS MATHEWS (V.O.),842,Who are you?
843,WELLES,843,"They brought her into the room...
one man, he put a knife to her
throat and he raped her..."
844,MRS MATHEWS,844,No...
845,WELLES,845,"He raped her and...and...and he
murdered her...he cut her up with
knifes..."
846,MRS MATHEWS (V.O.),846,No... no... no...
847,WELLES,847,"They killed her, and they took her
out in the forest somewhere and they
buried her..."
848,MRS MATHEWS (V.O.),848,"Why... why are you doing this to
me... ?"
849,WELLES,849,"They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm
sorry.  It happened a month after
she ran away.  She's been dead all
this time..."
850,WELLES,850,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there
wasn't anything anyone could do..."
851,AGENT,851,"There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed
through to Kennedy.  Gate 32B."
852,AGENT,852,Mr. Welles?
853,AGENT,853,Gate 32B.
854,WELLES,854,"Hello, can you connect me with the
duty nurse?"
855,WELLES,855,"Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson
down here in the Thirteenth
Precinct.  I've got a helluva
problem I was hoping you could give
me a hand with.  We had a stabbing
incident a couple of days ago, and
it looks like the supposed victim
gave us a false name and address.
Can you tell me if you had an adult
male with an abdominal wound in you
ER in the last forty-eight hours?"
856,WELLES,856,"You'd remember this guy; a body-
builder, real big guy, five foot
eleven, with acne all over his chest
and back..."
857,WELLES,857,"Alright, thanks for your help."
858,WELLES,858,"... guy sticks out like a sore
thumb.  Five foot ten or eleven,
body-builder, bad acne..."
859,WELLES,859,"Okay, thanks anyway."
860,WELLES (O.S.),860,"... abdominal wound.  You'd know him
if you saw him..."
861,WELLES,861,"He's a body-builder, stands just
under six feet..."
862,WELLES,862,"That's right... covered in acne.
That's him, that's the guy.  Listen,
we, uh... we think he filed a bogus
report on this stabbing, gave us a
false name and address..."
863,WELLES,863,"Yes, I'll hold."
864,WELLES,864,Yes... yes.
865,WELLES,865,"Christopher Higgins.  Thirty-
fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street.
Where?  Astoria, Queens."
866,WELLES,866,Hello?!  Amy?
867,AMY,867,Tom?!
868,AMY,868,"How much forgiveness do you think I
have in me?"
869,WELLES,869,"I can't talk about it yet... not
yet."
870,WELLES,870,Why... why... ?
871,AMY,871,Tom... ?
872,WELLES,872,"I have to tell you... I have to tell
you what happened.  I have to tell
you everything, but we can't tell
anyone else.  No one else can ever
know."
873,WELLES,873,"You're all I've got.  You're all
I've ever had."
874,WELLES,874,You're the only one who can save me.
