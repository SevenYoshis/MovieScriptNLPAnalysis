0,WORKER,0,Master Li is here!
1,AUNT WU,1,Shu Lien!
2,AUNT WU,2,Li Mu Bai is here!
3,LI,3,How's everything?
4,AUNT WU,4,Fine.  Please come in.
5,YU,5,Mu Bai...It's been too long.
6,LI,6,It has.
7,LI,7,How's business?
8,YU,8,Good.  And how are you?
9,LI,9,Fine.
10,YU,10,"Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan
Mountain.  He said you were
practicing deep meditation."
11,LI,11,Yes.
12,YU,12,"The mountain must be so peaceful...
I envy you.  My work keeps me so
busy, I hardly get any rest."
13,LI,13,I left the training early.
14,YU,14,"Why?  You're a Wudan fighter.
Training is everything."
15,LI,15,"During my meditation training... I
came to a place of deep silence...
I was surrounded by light... Time
and space disappeared.  I had come
to a place my master had never told
me about."
16,YU,16,You were enlightened?
17,LI,17,"No.  I didn't feel the bliss of
enlightenment.  Instead... I was
surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I
couldn't bear it.  I broke off my
meditation.  I couldn't go on.
There was something... pulling me
back."
18,YU,18,What was it?
19,LI,19,"Something I can't let go of.  You
are leaving soon?"
20,YU,20,"We're preparing a convoy for a
delivery to Peking."
21,LI,21,"Perhaps I could ask you to deliver
something to Sir Te for me."
22,YU,22,"The Green Destiny Sword?  You're
giving it to Sir Te?"
23,LI,23,"I am.  He has always been our
greatest protector."
24,YU,24,"I don't understand.  How can you
part with it?  It has always been
with you."
25,LI,25,"Too many men have died at its edge.
It only looks pure because blood
washes so easily from its blade."
26,YU,26,"You use it justly, you're worthy of
it."
27,LI,27,It's time for me to leave it behind.
28,YU,28,So what will you do now?
29,YU,29,"Come with me to Peking.  You can
give the sword to Sir Te yourself.
It'll be just like old times."
30,LI,30,"First I must visit my master's
grave.  It's been many years since
Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet
to avenge his death.  And yet I'm
thinking of quitting.  I must pray
for his forgiveness."
31,YU,31,"Join me once you have finished.  I
can wait for you in Peking."
32,LI,32,Perhaps.
33,GUARDS,33,Ok.  Pass.
34,YU,34,Thanks.  Let's go into the city.
35,GIAO,35,"Everything got here safely.  I'm
much obliged."
36,YU,36,Just doing my job.
37,GIAO,37,"Sun Security has been the best
since your father started it.
You're a credit to his memory."
38,YU,38,Thank you.
39,GIAO,39,I mean it.
40,SIR TE,40,"This is Li's personal sword, a
great hero's weapon!  He is the
only one in the world worthy of
carrying it.  It's too fine a gift.
I cannot accept it."
41,YU,41,"Sir Te!  It has brought him as much
trouble as glory.  Help him to
leave these troubles behind.
Otherwise, he'll never be able to
start anew."
42,SIR TE,42,"All right.  I'll act as the sword's
custodian."
43,DE LU,43,Governor Yu has arrived.
44,SIR TE,44,I must change.
45,YU,45,"You've always been so good to Li Mu
Bai and me.  Please accept our
thanks."
46,SIR TE,46,"Please do not be such a stranger.
You'll stay the night as my guest.
Now, Shu Lien... tell me something.
And forgive me for prying.  Your
father was a great friend to me,
and I think of you as my own
daughter."
47,YU,47,"Please, Sir Te, what is it?"
48,SIR TE,48,"Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and
his warrior days... maybe he's
trying to tell you something?"
49,YU,49,I don't know...
50,SIR TE,50,"Don't be coy.  I've always known
about your feelings for each other.
All these years, it's a shame...
neither of you is brave enough to
admit the truth to the other.
You're both wasting precious time."
51,YU,51,"I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I
aren't cowards."
52,SIR TE,52,"When it comes to emotions, even
great heroes can be idiots.  Tell
me if Li Mu Bai is not more open
the next time you see him.  I'll
give him an earful!"
53,DE LU,53,"Sir Te said to leave the sword in
here."
54,DE LU,54,Who are you?
55,JEN,55,"I'm your guest today.  I am Governor
Yu's daughter."
56,DE LU,56,"This is Sir Te's study.  You are
here to..."
57,JEN,57,I was looking for a quiet corner.
58,DE LU,58,"I am Sir Te's head servant.  And
this is another of our guests."
59,JEN,59,"It's heavy for such a thin piece of
metal!"
60,YU,60,"The handle is heavy.  And the blade
is no ordinary metal.  Still, the
sword is the lightest of weapons.
You're just not used to handling it."
61,JEN,61,"But I have had much practice.  As a
child in the West, a platoon lived
with us.  They'd let me play with
their weapons.  The scabbard is so
beautiful."
62,YU,62,"Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you
see it tainted with blood, its
beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400
years old."
63,JEN,63,Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
64,YU,64,"My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it
to Sir Te as a gift."
65,JEN,65,"Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior?
Why would he give his sword to Sir
Te?"
66,YU,66,You're too young to understand.
67,JEN,67,You're a sword fighter too?
68,YU,68,"Yes, I am.  But I prefer the
machete.  Certain moves, however,
call for a sword."
69,JEN,69,Really?
70,JEN,70,"It must be exciting to be a fighter,
to be totally free!"
71,YU,71,"Fighters have rules too: friendship,
trust, integrity... Without rules,
we wouldn't survive for long."
72,JEN,72,"I've read all about people like you.
Roaming wild, beating up anyone who
gets in your way!"
73,YU,73,"Writers wouldn't sell many books if
they told how it really is."
74,JEN,74,"But you're just like the characters
in the stories."
75,YU,75,"Sure.  No place to bathe for days,
sleeping in flea-infested beds...
They tell you all about that in
those books?"
76,JEN,76,"You know what I mean.  I'm getting
married soon, but I haven't lived
the life I want."
77,YU,77,"So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's
the most important step in a
woman's life, isn't it?"
78,JEN,78,"You're not married, are you?"
79,YU,79,What do you think?
80,JEN,80,"No!  You couldn't roam around
freely if you were."
81,YU,81,You're probably right.
82,SIR TE,82,"Go ahead, Governor Yu."
83,SIR TE,83,"Two feet 9 inches long.  1 inch
wide.  The handle is 1 inch deep,
2.6 inches wide.  Seven-tenths of
an inch thick.  With seven rubies
missing from the hilt.  You can
tell the design dates back to
before the Chin era.  Engraved with
a technique lost by the time of the
Han Dynasty."
84,GOVERNOR YU,84,"Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te."
85,SIR TE,85,"A sword by itself rules nothing.
It comes alive only through skillful
manipulation."
86,GOVERNOR YU,86,I see your point.  Please continue.
87,SIR TE,87,"The Imperial Court isn't the
problem.  With royalty and officials
everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps
security tight.  But Peking is not
like the West.  Here, you'll find
all sorts of characters.  Proceed
with caution in your quest for law
and order.  Don't depend only on
the court.  Contacts in the Giang
Hu underworld can ensure your
position.  Be strong, yet supple.
This is the way to rule."
88,MAID,88,Governess...
89,GOVERNESS,89,Let me do it.
90,JEN,90,Please sit.
91,GOVERNESS,91,"I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you
want to change into them?"
92,JEN,92,Put them down.
93,GOVERNESS,93,I heard you met Shu Lien today.
94,JEN,94,Do you know her?
95,GOVERNESS,95,"She's one of those.  Your mother
would not want you consorting with
her kind."
96,JEN,96,"I'll socialize with whomever I
please."
97,GOVERNESS,97,"Don't invite danger into your
father's house."
98,JEN,98,I'm tired now.
99,GOVERNESS,99,"Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up,
and is getting married soon.  God
knows what the future will bring."
100,JEN,100,"It will be just the same.  Enough!
I'm tired."
101,GOVERNESS,101,"Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the
windows for you."
102,MASTER BO,102,"Chilly, eh?"
103,NIGHTMAN,103,"Yes, Master Bo."
104,BO,104,"Someone help!  Stop him!  He's on
the roof!  The sword's been stolen!
Stop thief!  Stop him!"
105,TSAI,105,It's Jade Fox!
106,MAY,106,We must avenge mother!
107,BO,107,Do something!  He's getting away!
108,YU,108,"Return the sword, and I'll let you
go."
109,YU,109,You've been trained at Wudan?
110,TSAI,110,"You're mistaken.  We're just street
performers.  We were rehearsing."
111,MAY,111,Father!
112,BO,112,"You were rehearsing?  Who are you
trying to fool?"
113,BO,113,Where did that thief go?
114,BO,114,Governor Yu's house!
115,YU,115,Get down here!  Give back the sword!
116,DE LU,116,Sir Te awaits you.
117,BO,117,"I'm sure the thief is in the Yu
household."
118,SIR TE,118,How dare you imply?
119,BO,119,But I say --
120,SIR TE,120,-- Enough.
121,YU,121,Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
122,SIR TE,122,"Yes, though I doubt he's involved
in this."
123,YU,123,"But the sword could be in his
compound."
124,SIR TE,124,"Then someone's trying to set him up.
We should inform Li Mu Bai."
125,MADAM YU,125,What is it?
126,MAID,126,"Madam Yu, someone's put up posters."
127,MADAM YU,127,Let me see.
128,GOVERNESS,128,"Someone is after Jade Fox.
Preposterous, looking for her here!"
129,BO,129,Where are they?
130,HOMELESS MAN,130,"I don't know.  I haven't seen them
in two days."
131,MAID,131,"There is a Miss Shu Lien here to
see you."
132,GOVERNESS,132,Miss is busy right now.
133,MAID,133,I'll tell her.
134,JEN,134,Show her in.
135,GOVERNESS,135,This spells trouble.
136,JEN,136,I have a guest.
137,MAID,137,This way please.
138,JEN,138,I've missed you.
139,YU,139,How so?
140,JEN,140,I'm bored.
141,YU,141,You're doing calligraphy?
142,JEN,142,I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
143,YU,143,"I never realized my name looks like
""sword."""
144,YU,144,"You write gracefully.  Calligraphy
is so similar to fencing."
145,JEN,145,Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
146,JEN,146,Please.
147,YU,147,"Thank you for seeing me.  I hear
your wedding day is near.  You must
be overwhelmed by the preparations."
148,JEN,148,"I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less
I think of it the better.  My
parents are arranging everything.
The Gous are a very powerful family.
My marrying one will be good for my
father's career."
149,YU,149,"You are fornuate to marry into such
a noble family."
150,JEN,150,"Am I?  I wish I were like the
heroes in the books I read.  Like
you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm
happy to be marrying.  But to be
free to live my own life, to choose
whom I love... That is true
happiness."
151,YU,151,"Do you think so?  Let me tell you a
story."
152,JEN,152,About you and Li Mu Bai?
153,YU,153,"Yes.  Did you know I was once
engaged to be married?"
154,JEN,154,"No, really?"
155,YU,155,"His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was
a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.
One day, while in battle, he was
killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's
enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went
through a lot together.  Our
feelings for each other grew
stronger.  But how could we dishonor
Meng's memory?  So the freedom you
talk about, I too desire it.  But I
have never tasted it."
156,JEN,156,"Too bad for Meng, but it's not your
fault, or Li Mu Bai's."
157,YU,157,"I am not an aristocrat, as you
are... but I must still respect a
woman's duties."
158,JEN,158,"Don't distance us.  From now on,
let's be like sisters."
159,YU,159,"Then as a sister, let me wish you
happiness in your marriage."
160,MADAM YU,160,"What a godforsaken place!  Can't
your father be appointed closer to
civilization?  Jen... are you
listening to me?"
161,TSAI,161,Let's go!
162,TSAI,162,Who are you?
163,BO,163,Wait!  I'm a friend!
164,TSAI,164,I don't care about your sword.
165,BO,165,Why were you spying on the Yus?
166,TSAI,166,"I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox.
I'm a police inspector from Shaan
Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a
master criminal.  I hear she
infiltrated the Yus.  She must have
come with them when they transferred
here.  But with Yu's reputation, I
can't just go in and accuse her."
167,BO,167,This Jade Fox is a woman?
168,TSAI,168,Yes.
169,BO,169,Then leave her to me.
170,TSAI,170,"Pardon me, but I doubt you can
handle her.  My wife was quite a
martial arts expert.  Jade Fox
killed her.  So you see, this is
personal.  Leave her to me."
171,MAY,171,It's ready!
172,BO,172,I'm ready for anything!
173,MAY,173,Father gets first dip.
174,TSAI,174,They're gone.
175,MAY,175,What does it say?
176,TSAI,176,"""We'll settle this at midnight on
Yellow Hill.""  Good, the fox is out
of her hole."
177,SIR TE,177,"Shu Lien, look who's here."
178,LI,178,"Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast
suspicion on Governor Yu."
179,YU,179,"But something is going on at the Yu
household."
180,LI,180,What have you discovered?
181,LI,181,Jade Fox?  Impossible.
182,YU,182,"You always suspected she'd fled to
the West."
183,LI,183,"I didn't think she'd dare come back
to Peking!"
184,YU,184,"Is there any place safer than under
the nose of Governor Yu?"
185,LI,185,"So I shall avenge my master's death
after all."
186,YU,186,"Be careful.  Sir Te requires
discretion.  Official business is
difficult enough.  Don't let
personal feelings make it worse.
And I don't know... even this
poster... could be some sort of trap."
187,LI,187,Did you see who posted it?
188,YU,188,No.
189,LI,189,"It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's.
On the night of the theft there was
a brawl near Yu's.  Were you
involved?"
190,YU,190,"It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he
followed the thief to the Yus'."
191,LI,191,Have you questioned him yet?
192,YU,192,"No, not yet..."
193,LI,193,"But your men are watching over Yu's
compund?"
194,YU,194,"No, I'd already sent them home.
You can blame me for losing the
sword, but please trust that I'll
get it back soon using my own
methods."
195,LI,195,"That's not what I meant.  I don't
care about the sword."
196,YU,196,"What do you mean?  Didn't you come
back here for it?"
197,LI,197,"I don't know it was stolen until I
got here."
198,YU,198,"Then, why did you come?"
199,LI,199,"Well, we had talked..."
200,DE LU,200,"Pardon my intrusion.  Master Li,
your room is ready."
201,LI,201,Thank you.  Please lead the way.
202,BO,202,"The fox doesn't care much for
punctuality.  Still no sign of her."
203,TSAI,203,Enough!  Show yourself.
204,FOX,204,"Tsai... you dog!  You will pay for
your stubbornness."
205,BO,205,"That's what you think, old witch!"
206,TSAI,206,"If you surrender now, you'll suffer
less.  But if you resist, I won't
stop until you're dead."
207,MAY,207,"Father!  Let me avenge my mother's
death."
208,FOX,208,"You'll soon end up like her, you
little whore!"
209,BO,209,You'll pay for that!
210,TSAI,210,She's going to paralyze you!
211,TSAI,211,May!
212,FOX,212,"Tsai, you filthy mongrel!  An ambush!"
213,MAY,213,"Father, are you all right?"
214,LI,214,"Wudan should have gotten rid of you
long ago.  It's been a long time,
Jade Fox!  You don't remember me...
But you should remember my master.
You infiltrated Wudan while I was
away.  You stole our master!  Now
it's time for you to pay!"
215,FOX,215,"Your master underestimated us women.
Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he
would never teach me.  He deserved
to die by a woman's hand!"
216,LI,216,"You stole the secrets of Wudan's
highest martial arts.  But after
ten years of training, your moves
are still undisciplined.  And
today, under a Wudan sword... you
will die!"
217,FOX,217,"Disciple, we'll kill them all!"
218,FIGURE IN BLACK,218,Let's go!
219,BO,219,Another one!
220,FOX,220,I must get rid of Tsai!
221,LI,221,"Who are you?  Why is the Green
Destiny in your possession?"
222,FIGURE IN BLACK,222,What's it to you?
223,LI,223,"My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green
Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be
your master.  Where did you learn
that ""Xuan Piu"" move?"
224,FIGURE IN BLACK,224,I'm just playing around.
225,LI,225,"Tell me, who is your master?"
226,FIGURE IN BLACK,226,Let's go!
227,FOX,227,We must kill them!
228,MAY,228,Father!
229,TE,229,This is Tsai?
230,MAY,230,"My father.  Police Inspector from
Shaan."
231,TE,231,"This should be reported to Governor
Yu.  The victim is an officer.  You
believe the killer is hiding out in
his compound."
232,YU,232,I'd bet my life on it!
233,TE,233,Come with me.
234,SIR TE,234,"This needs to be resolved, and
quickly."
235,LI,235,"I'll get into the Yu household and
get her.  I'll ferret out Fox and
her gang."
236,YU,236,"We must be careful.  Governor Yu is
a court official, and in charge of
security.  Any disturbance will
cast suspicion on him.  It might
get Sir Te in trouble."
237,SIR TE,237,This is a delicate matter.
238,YU,238,"Sir Te, can you find some excuse to
invite Madam Yu and her daughter?"
239,SIR TE,239,What do you have in mind?
240,YU,240,"The best way to trap a fox is
through her cubs."
241,MADAM YU,241,"Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
with these wedding gifts.  She's
being so considerate."
242,YU,242,"I'm sorry she's not feeling well
enough to receive you today."
243,MADAM YU,243,"I heard Sir Te lost something.  And
now Madame Te's not feeling well..."
244,YU,244,"We know who stole the missing item.
If the thief returns it, I'm sure
Sir Te will pursue the matter no
further."
245,MADAM YU,245,"That's good.  Sometimes the help
can't keep their hands to themselves.
It's very embarassing."
246,YU,246,"Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
people can make mistakes... that
can bring ruin to themselves and
their families."
247,MADAM YU,247,But don't be too lenient.
248,YU,248,"No mercy will be shown toward the
murderer who turned up in Peking."
249,MADAM YU,249,A murderer?
250,YU,250,"Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu
Bai's own master.  Last night, she
killed a policeman who had tracked
her down."
251,MADAM YU,251,A female criminal!  Now that's news!
252,JEN,252,You say she killed a policeman?
253,YU,253,"Yes, from the West.  He went
undercover and and followed her
here,"
254,MADAM YU,254,"Maybe the murderer and the thief
are one and the same."
255,YU,255,"I doubt it.  This thief... it very
unusual..."
256,YU,256,"...And most likely smarter than a
mere killer."
257,JEN,257,"Greetings, Sir Te."
258,SIR TE,258,"Hello, Madam Yu.  This is Li Mu
Bai, the renowned swordsman."
259,LI,259,Delighted to meet you.
260,TE,260,Miss Yu is soon to be married.
261,LI,261,Congratulations.
262,MAY,262,Why don't you come in?
263,BO,263,I'm standing guard.
264,MAY,264,Come in.  It's cold.
265,MAY,265,"Come in.  We don't have to fear
Jade Fox if we're together."
266,LI,266,"Isn't it a bit too late to be out?
You've brought me the sword?"
267,FIGURE,267,I do as I please.
268,LI,268,Where's your master?
269,FIGURE,269,What's it to you?
270,LI,270,"Had enough flying?  You've got
potential.  You've studied the
Wudan Manual but you don't
understand it.  You need a real
master."
271,FIGURE,271,Do you think you are a real master?
272,LI,272,"Like most things, I am nothing.
It's the same for this sword.  All
of it is simply a state of mind."
273,FIGURE,273,"Stop talking like a monk!  Just
fight!"
274,LI,274,Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
275,FIGURE,275,On guard!
276,LI,276,Real sharpness comes without effort.
277,LI,277,"No growth without assistant.  No
action without reaction.  No desire
without restraint.  Now give
yourself up and find yourself again.
There is a lesson for you."
278,FIGURE,278,Go ahead.
279,LI,279,"Why should I?  You need practice.
I can teach you to fight with the
Green Destiny, but first you must
learn to hold it in stillness."
280,FIGURE,280,Why do you want to teach me?
281,LI,281,"I've always wanted a disciple
worthy of Wudan's secrets."
282,FIGURE,282,And if I use them to kill you?
283,LI,283,"That's a risk I'm willing to take.
Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade
Fox couldn't corrupt you."
284,FIGURE,284,"Wudan is a whorehouse!  Keep your
lessons!"
285,FOX,285,"You're home late... or should I say
early?"
286,JEN,286,"Why are you still here?  You killed
a policeman.  You should leave!
You'll bring ruin on my whole family."
287,FOX,287,"They wouldn't have found me if you
hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a
little girl, you thought stealing
would be fun?  You, too, are
responsible for that death.  Come
with me.  You don't want to waste
your life as the wife of some
bureaucrat.  Denied your talent...
As a master and disciple we will
rule."
288,JEN,288,I'll never live as a thief!
289,FOX,289,You're already a thief.
290,JEN,290,"That was just for fun.  How can I
leave?  Where would I go?"
291,FOX,291,"Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of
anyone in our way.  Even your father."
292,JEN,292,Shut up!
293,FOX,293,"It's the Giang Hu fighter
lifestyle... kill or be killed.
Exciting, isn't it?"
294,JEN,294,I owe you nothing.
295,FOX,295,"Yes, you do!  You are still my
disciple."
296,JEN,296,"You think you've been teaching me
all these years from the manual?
You couldn't even decipher the
symbols!"
297,FOX,297,"I studied the diagrams.  But you
hid the details!"
298,JEN,298,"You wouldn't have understood, even
if I had tried to explain.  You
know... you've gone as far as you
can go.  I hid my skills so as not
to hurt you."
299,FOX,299,"If I hadn't seen you fight with Li
Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of
all you've hidden from me."
300,JEN,300,"Master... I started learning from
you in secret when I was 10.  You
enchanted me with the world of
Giang Hu.  But once I realized I
could surpass you, I became so
frightened!  Everything fell apart.
I had no one to guide me, no one to
learn from."
301,FOX,301,"Believe me, I've a lesson or two
left to teach you!"
302,YU,302,The sword is back... are you happy?
303,LI,303,"I admit, getting it back makes me
realize how much I'd missed it."
304,YU,304,"But it's not your sword anymore.
You gave it to Sir Te."
305,LI,305,"True.  But I must borrow it for one
last mission.  Jade Fox must die at
its edge.  Did you know what you
were hiding when you covered for
that girl?"
306,YU,306,"My job was to get the sword back,
without embarassing anyone.  I
wasn't about to ruin her life, or
her father's."
307,LI,307,"You did your job well.  But, this
girl... I saw her last night."
308,YU,308,I knew she would intrigue you.
309,LI,309,She needs direction... and training.
310,YU,310,"She's an aristocrat's daughter.
She's not one of us.  In any case,
it will all be over soon.  You'll
kill Fox, and she'll marry."
311,LI,311,"That's not for her.  She should
come to Wudan and become a disciple."
312,YU,312,But Wudan does not accept women.
313,LI,313,"For her, they might make an
exception.  If not, I'm afraid
she'll become a poisoned dragon."
314,YU,314,"It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan
accepts her, her husband might
object."
315,LI,315,"I thought by giving away the sword,
I could escape the Giang Hu world.
But the cycle of bloodshed continues."
316,YU,316,"I wish there were something more I
could do to help you."
317,LI,317,"Just be patient with me, Shu Lien."
318,JEN,318,Lo?
319,LO,319,Jen!
320,JEN,320,You shouldn't have come.
321,LO,321,"With all the traffic on your
rooftop these days... it took me a
while to get in here.  I can't wait
any longer.  I was wrong to let you
go.  Come back with me.  You'll be
happy in the desert.  You'll be
free there."
322,JEN,322,"You've been looking for me all this
time?"
323,MADAM YU,323,Jen... stop playing with it.
324,JEN,324,I won't break it.
325,GUARD A,325,"It's Dark Cloud!  Dark Cloud is
coming!"
326,MADAM YU,326,"Lower the shade, don't let them see
you!"
327,DARK CLOUD (LO),327,Don't touch the women!
328,LO,328,Let's go!
329,LO,329,Come get your comb.
330,LO,330,Hurry back to your mother.
331,LO,331,She's mine.
332,LO,332,Let's stop a moment.
333,JEN,333,Give it back!
334,LO,334,"You're tired.  You need rest.  Your
horse needs water.  There's a creek
up here."
335,LO,335,"Well, there used to be!  What's
your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call
me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall
or big, but I'm quick as lightning."
336,JEN,336,My comb!
337,LO,337,"If you like that arrow, I can make
you a bow.  Great for hunting wild
chicken.  They're delicious."
338,LO,338,"You need to eat, understand?  Then
you'll have the strength to fight.
Understand?"
339,LO,339,You're eating too fast.  Slowly.
340,LO,340,"You've got quite a temper.  It's
better this way."
341,JEN,341,You coward!
342,LO,342,"Still in a bad mood?  At least
you're speaking.  What's your name?"
343,LO,343,"I didn't think the Hans had names
like that."
344,LO,344,"Relax.  If I had wanted to, I would
already have done it.  You must be
dying for a bath.  Fresh water's
hard to get here.  But I managed to
bring some up.  You can wear my
clothes when you're done.  They're
clean.  Don't worry.  I'll sing, so
you'll know where I am.  After the
bath, you'll be calmer."
345,LO,345,"No more hitting on the head!  All
this trouble for a comb?"
346,JEN,346,"It's mine.  It means a lot to me.
A barbarian like you wouldn't
understand."
347,LO,347,"Not true.  I can use it to pick
fleas from my horse."
348,JEN,348,"By the way, I'm a real Manchurian."
349,LO,349,"I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I
though you were a Han."
350,JEN,350,Give me back my comb.
351,LO,351,I don't take orders from anyone.
352,JEN,352,Give it back.
353,LO,353,"When I was a boy, one night, I saw
a thousand shooting stars.  I
thought, where did they all go?
I'm an orphan.  I used to look for
stars alone.  I thought if I rode
to the other end of the desert, I'd
find them.  I've been riding in the
desert ever since."
354,JEN,354,"And so, the little boy became a
fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find
the stars, so he stole my comb."
355,LO,355,"Out here, you always fight for
survival.  You have to be part of a
gang to stand a chance.  Slowly,
your gang becomes your family.  All
that Dark Cloud stuff is just to
scare people and make my life easier."
356,JEN,356,"So you're still that little boy
looking for shooting stars."
357,LO,357,"I am a man.  And now I've found the
brightest star of all."
358,LO,358,"Your father's men are looking for
you."
359,LO,359,"Your father's men are still looking
for you.  They're still out there,
circling closer."
360,JEN,360,Let them look.
361,LO,361,It is trouble for me.
362,JEN,362,Don't send me back!
363,LO,363,"You must decide.  You might get
tired of this life.  You might
begin to miss your family.  If it
were our daughter, we'd look for
her too.  She would miss us.  Jen...
I want you to be mine forever.  I
will make my mark on the world.  I
will earn your parents' respect.
We have a legend.  Anyone who dares
to jump from the mountain, God will
grant his wish.  Long ago, a young
man's parents were ill, so he
jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't
even hurt.  He floated away, far
away, never to return.  He knew his
wish had come true.  If you believe,
it will happen.  The elders say, ""A
faithful heart makes wishes come
true."""
364,JEN,364,"Keep it safe.  Return it to me when
we are together again."
365,LO,365,I will.
366,JEN,366,"If you don't, I'll come after you.
And I won't let you off so easy."
367,LO,367,"Wherever I went, someone always
recognized me.  I really tried.
Later, I heard you came to Peking.
I was afraid I'd never see you
again.  So I came.  I can't let you
marry."
368,JEN,368,Go.
369,LO,369,Jen...
370,JEN,370,Don't ever come back.
371,LO,371,So it's over?
372,JEN,372,Yes.
373,MAID,373,We heard noises.
374,JEN,374,It was just a cat.
375,YU,375,You think Jade Fox will show up?
376,LI,376,"She's out there, but I doubt she'll
show herself.  We'll keep our eyes
open.  Sooner or later, she'll come
for the girl."
377,LO,377,Jen!  Come with me!  You're mine!
378,LO,378,"Come with me to the desert!  Jen!
Come with me to Xin Jiang!"
379,LI,379,Where is Jade Fox?
380,YU,380,Come with me!  Hurry!
381,YU,381,"You thought she'd give it all up
and go back West with you?"
382,LO,382,She's mine.
383,LI,383,"Either way, you are no good to her
dead.  With the Gou and Yu clans
hunting you, you'll soon be in
their hands."
384,LO,384,I don't care anymore.
385,LI,385,"If you truly loved her, you wouldn't
say that."
386,YU,386,Don't you want to see her again.
387,LI,387,"All right.  I'll write you an
introduction.  Take it to Wudan.
Wait there for news from me."
388,LO,388,All right.
389,SIR TE,389,"When will this end?  They take it,
they put it back, they take it
again.  My home is turning into a
warehouse."
390,TE,390,Speak!
391,BO,391,"Jen has run away!  Gou found the
wedding chamber empty.  Governor Yu
requests your assistance.  You know
the Giang Hu underworld.  He wants
to find her, and keep her from harm."
392,LI,392,"Sir Te, leave this to us.  Don't
worry."
393,WAITRESS,393,What can I serve you?
394,JEN,394,The cup is dirty.
395,GANGSTER A,395,Hello.  What is your name?
396,JEN,396,Long.
397,GANGSTER B,397,"It's young Master Long.  My
apologies.  I'm Iron Eagle Sung and
this is my brother in arms, Flying
Cougar Li Yun.  What brings you to
Huai An, and where are you headed,
Master Long?"
398,JEN,398,Anywhere there's action.
399,GANGSTER A,399,"In that case, perhaps we could be
of assistance."
400,JEN,400,Don't bother.
401,GANGSTER A,401,You don't seem to understand.
402,JEN,402,So what if I don't?
403,GANGSTER B,403,"We have ways of helping you
understand."
404,GANGSTER A,404,Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
405,JEN,405,He is my defeated foe!
406,YU,406,Have some tea.
407,LI,407,"Shu Lien... The things we touch
have no permanence.  My master
would say... there is nothing we
can hold on to in this world.  Only
by letting go can we truly possess
what is real."
408,YU,408,"Not everything is an illusion.  My
hand... wasn't that real?"
409,LI,409,"Your hand, rough and callused from
machete practice... All this time,
I've never had the courage to touch
it."
410,LI,410,"Giang Hu is a world of tigers and
dragons, full of corruption... I
tried sincerely to give it up but I
have brought us only trouble."
411,YU,411,"To repress one's feelings only
makes them stronger."
412,LI,412,"You're right, but I don't know what
to do.  I want to be with you...
just like this.  It gives me a
sense of peace."
413,WAITER,413,Please follow me.
414,JEN,414,I want a clean room.
415,WAITER,415,We have plenty.  Your order?
416,JEN,416,"Steamed whole cod, bite-size
meatballs, a little starchy, but
keep the sauce light, shark fin
soup, mixed vegetables, and some
warm wine."
417,WAITER,417,"I have to order from a bigger
restaurant."
418,JEN,418,Hurry then.
419,GIANG HU A,419,That's him.
420,MI BIAO,420,"I am Iron Arm Mi.  I heard a true
master has arrived.  I have come to
seek a lesson."
421,MI BIAO,421,You asked for it!
422,JEN,422,What kind of Iron Arm are you?
423,FLYING MACHETE CHANG,423,"You have amazing technique!  I am
Flying Machete.  Are you related to
Southern Crane?"
424,JEN,424,"Southern Duck?  I don't eat anything
with two feet.  Who could remember
such long-winded names?"
425,GOU JUN SIHUNG,425,"Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and
you don't know his master, Southern
Crane?"
426,JEN,426,Who are you?
427,GOU JUN SIHUNG,427,I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.
428,JEN,428,"Gou?  I hate that name.  It makes
me puke!  Too bad you're named Gou.
You'll be the first to feel my
sword today."
429,MONK JING,429,Hold it!  Don't you know Monk Jing?
430,JEN,430,"A monk, in a place like this?  You
need a lesson!"
431,MONK JING,431,Who are you?
432,JEN,432,"Who am I?  I am... I am the
Invincible Sword Goddess.  Armed
with the Incredible... Green
Destiny.  Be you Li or Southern
Crane... lower your head... and ask
for mercy.  I am the desert dragon.
I leave no trace.  Today I fly over
Eu-Mei.  Tomorrow... I'll kick over
Wudan Mountain!"
433,FLYING MACHETE CHANG,433,"We politely asked for a friendly
match, but she showed no respect,
and attacked us.  Everyone came by
to teach her a lesson."
434,MI BIAO,434,Her sword was just too powerful.
435,MONK JING,435,"I've traveled everywhere, but never
met anyone so uncivilized."
436,SHINING PHOENIX MOUNTAIN GOD,436,"She kept accusing me of being Gou
Jun Pei's brother.  Who is this
Gou, anyway?"
437,YU,437,Her husband.
438,LI,438,"We're close to your headquarters.
Go home and check in."
439,YU,439,What about you?
440,LI,440,I'll look around and catch up later.
441,YU,441,"Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get
a good night's sleep at headquarters."
442,SECURITY MAN A,442,"Mistress, you're back."
443,YU,443,It's you!  How's everything here?
444,CAPTAIN,444,Fine.  You've been gone a while.
445,YU,445,"Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.
Your wife was due?"
446,AH WAI,446,"Yeah, a baby girl."
447,YU,447,Good!
448,AH WAI,448,"I'll be happy if she's half as
strong as you."
449,YU,449,Mrs. Wu...
450,AUNT WU,450,You're back!
451,YU,451,How's the arm?  Still sore?
452,AUNT WU,452,"Much better.  You've been gone so
long."
453,YU,453,"Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the
night."
454,AUNT WU,454,I'll go and make up his room!
455,JEN,455,Sister Shu Lien...
456,YU,456,Here you must be in proper attire.
457,JEN,457,"I'm just borrowing some clean
clothes.  I'm not staying."
458,YU,458,I'll give them to you.
459,JEN,459,"I was just passing by and wondered
how you were."
460,JEN,460,"You, sister..."
461,YU,461,"Look at the trouble you've caused.
Now you know what Giang Hu life is
really like.  If you think of me as
your sister, let me give you some
sisterly advice.  You can run from
marriage, but not your parents."
462,JEN,462,They forced me to marry!
463,YU,463,"Go back to them first.  Then you
can decide about Lo."
464,JEN,464,You know about Lo?
465,YU,465,"He really loves you.  Come back to
Peking with me.  We'll find a
solution."
466,JEN,466,Where is he now?
467,YU,467,"Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.
He sent him to Wudan Mountain."
468,JEN,468,"You're working together to set me
up!  I'm leaving!"
469,YU,469,"How dare you accuse us?  I always
knew you had stolen the sword!
I've done nothing but protect you
and your family.  And you're repaid
me with nothing but contempt.  Li
Mu Bai himself spared you, and all
you do is insult him.  We wanted
some peace and you've ruined it all!
You're no sister of mine!"
470,JEN,470,"What do I care?  You were never a
real friend anyway.  But I wonder,
how long could you last as my enemy?"
471,YU,471,Put the sword down!
472,YU,472,Jen!
473,YU,473,Everyone out.  Shut the doors.
474,YU,474,Fine... the friendship is over.
475,YU,475,"Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's
sword."
476,JEN,476,Come and get it if you can.
477,YU,477,"Without the Green Destiny, you are
nothing."
478,JEN,478,"Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead.
Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go
ahead."
479,YU,479,Give me the sword.
480,JEN,480,Take it!
481,LI,481,"Stop it!  You don't deserve the
Green Destiny."
482,JEN,482,Not another lecture!  On guard!
483,LI,483,Let's end this here.
484,JEN,484,Only the sword will settle this.
485,LI,485,"I only let you go because I wanted
to see the real you."
486,JEN,486,What do you know about a true heart?
487,JEN,487,What do you want?
488,LI,488,"What I've always wanted, to teach
you."
489,JEN,489,"All right.  If you can take back
the sword in three moves, I'll go
with you."
490,JEN,490,Give it back!
491,LI,491,Kneel!
492,JEN,492,Never!
493,LI,493,Then you have no use for the sword.
494,FOX,494,"Sooner or later, they'd drag you
back to Peking.  Your parents will
never accept you again.  But why go
home?  We've gone this far, we
won't stop now.  You'll always be
my lady.  At last, we'll be our own
masters.  We'll be happy.  That's
the most important thing.  All we
have left is each other, right?
Lie down and rest."
495,AUNT WU,495,"She's crazy.  You should have
killed her."
496,YU,496,I didn't have the heart.
497,AUNT WU,497,"Well, Li Mu Bai can do it."
498,JEN,498,Is it me or the sword you want?
499,LI,499,You've been drugged!
500,LI,500,Where is Jade Fox?
501,YU,501,What happened?
502,LI,502,"Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you
get here?"
503,YU,503,We followed Jade Fox.
504,LI,504,And so you die.
505,FOX,505,And so shall you!
506,YU,506,A poisoned needle!
507,FOX,507,"You deserve to die, but the life I
was hoping to take... was Jen's.
Ten years I devoted to you.  But
you deceived me!  You hid the
manual's true meaning.  I never
improved... but your progress was
limitless!  You know what poison is?
An eight-year-old girl, full of
deceit.  That's poison!  Jen!  My
only family... my only enemy..."
508,YU,508,"You can't die!  Tell us what poison
you used!  You can't die!  Tell us
the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu
Bai die!"
509,JEN,509,"She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin
poison.  It goes straight to the
heart."
510,LI,510,"My blood will soon reverse its flow.
It's the same poison she used to
kill my master.  There is no
antidote."
511,YU,511,"That can't be!  Everything has an
antithesis!  Why not this?"
512,JEN,512,"The antidote exists.  She taught it
to me.  The formula is simple, but
it takes time to prepare.  Trust me.
As you have helped me, let me help
you."
513,LI,513,"All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on
as long as I can."
514,YU,514,"Take my horse and go to the compound.
Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help
you.  Hurry!"
515,JEN,515,Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
516,JEN,516,Where is Mrs. Wu?
517,AUNT WU,517,Stop it!
518,JEN,518,Shu Lien told me to show you this.
519,AUNT WU,519,Let her in.
520,YU,520,"Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some
hope..."
521,LI,521,Shu Lien...
522,YU,522,Save your strength.
523,LI,523,"My life is departing.  I've only
one breath left."
524,YU,524,"Use it to meditate.  Free yourself
from this world as you have been
taught.  Let your soul rise to
eternity with your last breath.  Do
not waste it... for me."
525,LI,525,"I've already wasted my whole life.
I want to tell you with my last
breath... I have always loved you.
I would rather be a ghost, drifting
by your side... as a condemned
soul... than enter heaven without
you.  Because of your love... I
will never be a lonely spirit."
526,JEN,526,He's gone?
527,YU,527,"Bo... please take this sword back
to Sir Te."
528,YU,528,"Now you must go to Wudan Mountain.
Lo awaits you there.  Promise me
one thing, whatever path you take
in this life... be true to yourself."
529,JEN,529,"Do you remember the legend of the
young man?"
530,LO,530,"""A faithful heart makes wishes come
true."""
531,JEN,531,"Make a wish, Lo."
532,LO,532,"To be back in the desert, together
again."
