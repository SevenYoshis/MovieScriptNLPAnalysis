0,JACK (V.O.),0,"People were always asking me, did I
know Tyler Durden."
1,TYLER,1,One minute.
2,TYLER,2,"This is the beginning.  We're at
ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
few words, to mark the occasion."
3,JACK,3,... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
4,JACK (V.O.),4,"With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you only speak in vowels."
5,JACK,5,I can't think of anything.
6,JACK (V.O.),6,"With my tongue, I can feel the
rifling in the barrel.  For a second,
I totally forgot about Tyler's whole
controlled demolition thing and I
wondered how clean this gun is."
7,TYLER,7,It's getting exciting now.
8,JACK (V.O.),8,"That old saying, how you always hurt
the one you love, well, it works both
way."
9,JACK (V.O.),9,"We have front row seats for this
Theater of Mass Destruction.  The
Demolitions Committee of Project
Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns
of ten buildings with blasting
gelatin.  In two minutes, primary
charges will blow base charges, and
those buildings will be reduced to
smoldering rubble.  I know this
because Tyler knows this."
10,TYLER,10,Look what we've accomplised.
11,TYLER,11,Thirty seconds.
12,JACK (V.O.),12,"Somehow, I realize all of this -- the
gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is
really about Marla Singer."
13,JACK (V.O.),13,Bob had bitch tits.
14,JACK (V.O.),14,"This was a support group for men with
testicular cancer.  The big moosie
slobbering all over me was Bob."
15,BOB,15,We're still men.
16,JACK,16,Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
17,JACK (V.O.),17,"Six months ago, Bob's testicles were
removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He
developed bitch tits because his
testosterone was too high and his
body upped the estrogen.  That was
where my head fit -- into his huge,
sweating tits that hung enormous, the
way we think of God's as big."
18,BOB,18,"They're gonna have to open my pec's
again to drain the fluid."
19,BOB,19,Okay.  You cry now.
20,JACK (V.O.),20,Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier.
21,JACK (V.O.),21,For six months.  I could not sleep.
22,JACK (V.O.),22,"With insomnia, nothing is real.
Everything is far away.  Everything
is a copy of a copy of a copy."
23,JACK (V.O.),23,"When deep space exploration ramps up,
it will be corporations that name
everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere.
The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet
Starbucks."
24,BOSS,24,"I'm going to need you out-of-town a
little more this week.  We've got
some ""red-flags"" to cover."
25,JACK (V.O.),25,"It must've been Tuesday.  he was
wearing his ""cornflower-blue"" tie."
26,JACK,26,"You want me to de-prioritize my
current reports until you advise of
a status upgrade?"
27,BOSS,27,"You need to make these your primary
""action items."""
28,JACK (V.O.),28,"He was full of pep.  Must've had his
grande latte enema."
29,BOSS,29,"Here are your flight coupons.  Call
me from the road if there are any
snags.  Your itinerary..."
30,JACK (V.O.),30,"Like everyone else, I had become a
slave to the IKEA nesting instinct."
31,JACK,31,"Yes.  I'd like to order the Erika
Pekkari slip covers."
32,JACK (V.O.),32,"If I saw something like clever coffee
table sin the shape of a yin and
yang, I had to have it."
33,JACK (V.O.),33,"Like the Johanneshov armchair in the
Strinne green stripe pattern..."
34,JACK (V.O.),34,"Or the Rislampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached
paper."
35,JACK (V.O.),35,"Even the Vild hall clock of
galvanized steel, resting on the
Klipsk shelving unit."
36,JACK (V.O.),36,"I would flip through catalogs and
wonder, ""What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?""  We used to
read pornography.  Now it was the
Horchow Collection."
37,JACK,37,"No, I don't want Cobalt.  Oh, that
sounds nice.  Apricot."
38,JACK (V.O.),38,"I had it all.  Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
proof they were crafted by the
honest, simple, hard-working
indigenous peoples of wherever."
39,INTERN,39,"No, you can't die of insomnia."
40,JACK,40,"Maybe I died already.  Look at my
face."
41,INTERN,41,You need to lighten up.
42,JACK,42,Can't you give me something?
43,JACK (V.O.),43,"Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red
Seconals."
44,INTERN,44,"You need healthy, natural sleep.
Chew valerian root and get some more
exercise."
45,JACK,45,I'm in pain.
46,INTERN,46,"You want to see pain?  Swing by First
Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the
guys with testicular cancer.  That's
pain."
47,SPEAKER,47,"I... wanted three kids.  Two boys and
a girl.  Mindy wanted two girls and
one boy.  We never could agree on
anything."
48,SPEAKER,48,"Well, she had her first child a month
ago, a girl, with her new husband...
And, Thank God.  I'm glad for her,
because she deserves..."
49,LEADER,49,"Everyone, let's thank Thomas for
sharing himself with us."
50,EVERYONE,50,"Thank you, Thomas."
51,LEADER,51,"I look around this room and I see a
lot of courage.  And it gives me
strength.  We give each other
strength."
52,LEADER,52,"It's time for the one-on-one.  Let's
follow Thomas's example and open
ourselves."
53,LEADER,53,Can everyone find a partner?
54,JACK (V.O.),54,"The big moosie, his eyes already
shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees
together, invisible steps."
55,JACK (V.O.),55,"Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You
know that chest expansion program you
see on TV?  That was his idea."
56,BOB,56,"...using steroids.  I was a juicer.
Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for
racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm
bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids
won't return my calls..."
57,JACK (V.O.),57,"Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big rubbery one."
58,BOB,58,"Go ahead, Cornelius.  You can cry."
59,JACK (V.O.),59,"Then... something happened.  I was
lost in oblivion -- dark and silent
and complete."
60,JACK (V.O.),60,"I found freedom.  Losing all hope was
freedom."
61,JACK (V.O.),61,Babies don't sleep this well.
62,JACK (V.O.),62,I became addicted.
63,JACK (V.O.),63,"If I didn't say anything, people
assumed the worst.  They cried
harder.  I cried harder."
64,LEADER,64,"Tonight, we're going to open the
green door -- the heart chakra..."
65,JACK (V.O.),65,"I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host
to cancer or parasites; I was the
warm little center that the life of
this world crowded around."
66,LEADER,66,"...And you open the door and you
step inside.  We're inside our
hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a
white ball of healing light.  That's
right, the pain itself is a ball of
healing light."
67,LEADER,67,"It moves over your body, healing you.
Keep this going and step forward,
through the back door of the room.
Where does it lead?  To your cave.
Step forward into your cave."
68,LEADER'S VOICE,68,"That's right.  You're going deeper
into your cave.  And you're going to
find your power animal..."
69,PENGUIN,69,Slide.
70,JACK (V.O.),70,"Every evening I died and every
evening I was born again.  Resurrected."
71,JACK (V.O.),71,"Bob loved me because he thought my
testicles were removed too.  Being
there, my face against his tits,
ready to cry -- this was my vacation."
72,JACK (V.O.),72,"And, she ruined everything."
73,MARLA,73,"This is cancer, right?"
74,JACK (V.O.),74,"This ... chick ... Marla Singer ...
did not have testicular cancer.  She
was a liar."
75,JACK (V.O.),75,"She had no diseases at all.  I had
seen her at my melanoma Monday night
group ..."
76,JACK (V.O.),76,"... and at ""Free and Clear,"" my blood
parasites group Thursdays."
77,JACK (V.O.),77,"-- And, again, at ""Seize The Day,"" my
tuberculosis Friday night."
78,JACK (V.O.),78,"Marla -- the big tourist.  Her lie
reflected my lie."
79,JACK (V.O.),79,"And suddenly, I felt nothing.  I
couldn't cry.  So, once again, I
could not sleep."
80,JACK,80,"No, I just can't believe that card is
declined -- Okay, okay, let me give
you a different card number."
81,JACK (V.O.),81,"Next group, after guided meditation,
after we open our chakras, when it's
time to hug, I'm going to grab that
little bitch, Marla Singer, pin her
arms against her sides and say..."
82,JACK,82,"Marla, you liar, you big tourist.  I
need this.  Get out."
83,JACK (V.O.),83,"When you have insomnia, you're never
really asleep and you're never really
awake.  I hadn't slept in four days..."
84,JACK (V.O.),84,"-- But, in here, in everyone, there's
the squint of a five-day headache.
Yet they forced themselves to be
positive.  They never said
""parasite;"" they said ""agent.""  They
always talked about getting better."
85,LEADER,85,"Okay, everyone."
86,LEADER,86,"To open tonight's communion, Chloe
would like to say a few words."
87,JACK (V.O.),87,"Ahh, Chloe.  Chloe looked the way
Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look
if you made it smile and walk around
a party being extra nice to everyone."
88,CHLOE,88,"Well, I'm still here -- but I don't
know for how long.  That's as much
certainty as anyone can give me.  but
I've got some good news -- I no
longer have any fear of death."
89,CHLOE,89,"But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
No one will have sex with me.  I'm so
close to the end and all I want is to
get laid for the last time.  I have
pornographic movies in my apartment,
and lubricants and amyl nitrate ..."
90,LEADER,90,"Thank you, Chloe.  Everyone, let's
thank Chloe."
91,EVERYONE,91,"Thank you, Chloe."
92,LEADER,92,"Now, you're standing at the entrance
to your cave.  You step inside your
cave and you walk.  Keep walking."
93,JACK (V.O.),93,"If I did have a tumor, I'd name it
Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on
the roof of your mouth that would
heal if only you could stop tonguing
it, but you can't."
94,LEADER,94,"Now, find your power animal."
95,MARLA,95,Slide.
96,LEADER,96,Pick someone special to you tonight.
97,CHLOE,97,"Hello, Mr. Tayler."
98,JACK (V.O.),98,"I never gave my real name at support
groups."
99,JACK,99,"Hi, Chloe."
100,CHLOE,100,We've never actually talked.
101,JACK,101,"You look good.  You ... look ... like
a pirate."
102,JACK,102,"Excuse me, I have to..."
103,JACK,103,We need to talk.
104,MARLA,104,Sure.
105,JACK,105,"I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You
aren't dying."
106,MARLA,106,What?
107,JACK,107,"Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy
way, we're all dying.  But you're not
dying the way Chloe is dying."
108,LEADER,108,Tell the other person how you feel.
109,JACK,109,"You're a tourist.  I saw you at
melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular
cancer."
110,MARLA,110,And I saw you practicing this...
111,JACK,111,Practicing what?
112,MARLA,112,"Telling me off.  Is it going as well
as you hoped... ?"
113,MARLA,113,"""... Mr. Taylor."""
114,JACK,114,I'll expose you.
115,MARLA,115,Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
116,LEADER,116,Share yourself completely.
117,JACK,117,Why are you doing this?
118,MARLA,118,"It's cheaper than a movie, and
there's free coffee."
119,JACK,119,"These are my groups.  I was here
first.  I've been coming for a year."
120,MARLA,120,A year?  How'd you manage that?
121,JACK,121,"Anyone who might've noticed either
died or recovered and never came back."
122,LEADER,122,Let yourself cry.
123,MARLA,123,Why do you do it?
124,JACK,124,"I... I don't know.  I guess... when
people think you're dying, they
really listen, instead..."
125,MARLA,125,"-- Instead of just waiting for their
turn to speak."
126,JACK,126,Yeah.
127,LEADER,127,"Quietly, now.  Share with each other."
128,JACK,128,It becomes an addiction.
129,MARLA,129,Really?
130,JACK,130,"Look, I can't cry with a faker
present."
131,MARLA,131,"Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not
my problem."
132,JACK,132,Please.  Can't we do something... ?
133,LEADER,133,"Now, the closing prayer."
134,JACK,134,"We'll split up the week.  You can
have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --"
135,MARLA,135,"You take tuberculosis.  My smoking
doesn't go over at all."
136,JACK,136,"I think testicular cancer should be
no contest."
137,MARLA,137,"Well, technically, I have more of a
right to be there than you.  You
still have your balls."
138,JACK,138,You're kidding.
139,MARLA,139,I don't know -- am I?
140,MARLA,140,I'll take the parasites.
141,JACK,141,"You can't have both parasites.  You
can take blood parasites --"
142,MARLA,142,I want brain parasites.
143,JACK,143,"Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and
organic brain dementia --"
144,MARLA,144,I want that.
145,JACK,145,You can't have the whole brain!
146,MARLA,146,"So far, you have four and I only have
two!"
147,JACK,147,"Then, take blood parasites.  It's
yours.  Now we each have three."
148,JACK,148,You... left half your clothes.
149,JACK,149,You're selling those?
150,MARLA,150,"Yes, I'm selling some chothes."
151,MARLA,151,"So, we each have three -- that's six.
What about the seventh day?  I want
ascending bowel cancer."
152,JACK (V.O.),152,The girl had done her homework.
153,JACK,153,I want ascending bowel cancer.
154,MARLA,154,"That's your favorite, too?  Tried to
slip it by me, eh?"
155,JACK,155,"We'll split it.  You get it the first
and third Sunday of the month."
156,MARLA,156,Deal.
157,MARLA,157,Looks like this is goodbye.
158,JACK,158,Let's not make a big thing out of it.
159,MARLA,159,How's this for not making a big thing?
160,JACK,160,"Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange
numbers?"
161,MARLA,161,Should we?
162,JACK,162,In case we want to switch nights.
163,MARLA,163,I suppose.
164,MARLA,164,"It doesn't have your name.  Who are
you?  Cornelius?  Mr. Taylor?  Dr.
Zaius?  Any of the stupid names you
give each night?"
165,JACK (V.O.),165,This is how I met Marla Singer.
166,JACK (V.O.),166,You wake up at O'Hare.
167,JACK (V.O.),167,You wake up at SeaTac.
168,ATTENDANT,168,"Check-in for that flight doesn't
begin for another two hours, Sir."
169,JACK (V.O.),169,"Pacific, Mountain, Central.  Lose an
hour, gain an hour.  This is your
life, and it's ending one minute at
a time."
170,JACK (V.O.),170,"You wake up at Air Harbor
International."
171,JACK (V.O.),171,"If you wake up at a different time
and in a different place, could you
wake up as a different person?"
172,JACK (V.O.),172,"Everywhere I travel -- tiny life.
Single-serving sugar, single-serving
cream, single pat of butter."
173,JACK (V.O.),173,Microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit.
174,JACK (V.O.),174,"Shampoo/conditioner combo.  Single-
serving mouthwash, tiny bar of soap."
175,JACK (V.O.),175,"The people I meet on each flight --
they're single-serving friends.
Between take-off and landing, we have
our time together, but that's all we
get."
176,JACK (V.O.),176,You wake up at Logan.
177,JACK (V.O.),177,"On a long enough time line, the
survival rate for everyone drops to
zero."
178,JACK (V.O.),178,"I'm a recall coordinator.  My job is
to apply the formula.  It's a story
problem."
179,TECHNICIAN #1,179,"Here's where the infant went through
the windshield.  Three points."
180,JACK (V.O.),180,"A new car built by my company leaves
somewhere traveling at 60 miles per
hour.  The rear differential locks up."
181,TECHNICIAN #2,181,"The teenager's braces around the
backseat ashtray would make a good
""anti-smoking"" ad."
182,JACK (V.O.),182,"The car crashes and burns with
everyone trapped inside.  Now: do we
initiate a recall?"
183,TECHNICIAN #1,183,"The father must've been huge.  See
how the fat burnt into the driver's
seat with his polyester shirt?  Very
""modern art."""
184,JACK (V.O.),184,"Take the number of vehicles in the
field, (A), and multiply it by the
probable rate of failure, (B), then
multiply the result by the average
out-of-court settlement, (C).  A
times B times C equals X..."
185,JACK,185,"If X is less than the cost of a
recall, we don't do one."
186,BUSISNESS WOMAN,186,"Are there a lot of these kinds of
accidents?"
187,JACK,187,"Oh, you wouldn't believe."
188,BUSINESS WOMAN,188,"... Which... car company do you work
for?"
189,JACK,189,A major one.
190,JACK (V.O.),190,"Every time the plane banked too
sharply on take-off or landing, I
prayed for a crash, or a mid-air
collision -- anything."
191,JACK (V.O.),191,"No more haircuts.  Nothing matters,
not even bad breath."
192,JACK (V.O.),192,"Life insurance pays off triple if you
die on a business trip."
193,VOICE,193,"There are three ways to make napalm.
One, mix equal parts of gasoline and
frozen orange juice..."
194,TYLER,194,"Two, equal parts gasoline and diet
cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter
in gasoline until the mixture is
thick."
195,JACK,195,Pardon me?
196,JACK (V.O.),196,This is how I met --
197,TYLER,197,Tyler Durden.
198,TYLER,198,"You know why they have oxygen masks
on planes?"
199,JACK,199,"No, supply oxygen?"
200,TYLER,200,"Oxygen gets you high.  In a
catastrophic emergency, we're taking
giant, panicked breaths..."
201,TYLER,201,"Suddenly, we become euphoic and
docile.  We accept our fate."
202,TYLER,202,"Emergency water landing, 600 miles
per hour.  Blank faces -- calm as
Hindu cows."
203,JACK,203,"What do you do, Tyler?"
204,TYLER,204,What do you want me to do?
205,JACK,205,I mean -- for a living.
206,TYLER,206,"Why?  So you can say, ""Oh, that's
what you do."" -- And be a smug little
shit about it?"
207,TYLER,207,"You have a kind of sick desperation
in your laugh."
208,JACK,208,We have the same briefcase.
209,TYLER,209,Open it.
210,TYLER,210,Soap -- the yardstick of civilization.
211,TYLER,211,I make and sell soap...
212,TYLER,212,"If you were to add nitric acid to the
soap-making process, one would get
nitroglycerin.  With enough soap, one
could blow up the world, if one were
so inclined."
213,JACK,213,"Tyler, you are by far the most
interesting ""single-serving"" friend
I've ever met."
214,JACK,214,"You see, when you travel, everything
is small, self-contained--"
215,TYLER,215,"The spork.  I get it.  You're very
clever."
216,JACK,216,Thank you.
217,TYLER,217,How's that working out for you?
218,JACK,218,What?
219,TYLER,219,Being clever.
220,JACK,220,"Well, uh... great."
221,TYLER,221,"Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up."
222,TYLER,222,"... As I squeeze past, do I give you
the ass or the crotch?"
223,TYLER,223,We are defined by the choices we make.
224,JACK (V.O.),224,"How I came to live with Tyler is:
airlines have this policy about
vibrating luggage."
225,SECURITY TFM,225,"Throwers don't worry about ticking.
Modern bombs don't tick."
226,JACK,226,"Excuse me?  ""Throwers?"""
227,SECURITY TFM,227,"Baggage handlers.  But when a
suitcase vibrates, the throwers have
to call the police."
228,JACK,228,My suitcase was vibrating?
229,SECURITY TFM,229,"Nine time out of ten, it's an
electric razor.  But, every once in
a while ..."
230,SECURITY TFM,230,"...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy
not to imply ownership in the event
of a dildo.  We use the indefinite
aricle: ""A dildo.""  Never ""Your
dildo."""
231,JACK,231,"I had everything in that bag.  My
C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes..."
232,SECURITY TFM,232,"Yeah, uh huh... yeah?"
233,SECURITY TFM,233,Oh...
234,SECURITY TFM,234,I'm terribly sorry.
235,SECURITY TFM,235,"You know the industry slang for
""Flight Attendant?""  ""Air Mattress."""
236,JACK (V.O.),236,"Home was a condo on the fifteenth
floor of a filing cabinet for widows
and young professionals.  The walls
were solid concrete.  A foot of
concrete is important when your next-
door neighbor lets her hearing aid go
and has to watch game shows at full
volume..."
237,JACK (V.O.),237,"-- Or when a volcanic blast of debris
that used to be your furniture and
personal effects blows out your floor-
to-ceiling windows and sails flaming
into the night."
238,DOORMAN,238,There's nothing up there.
239,DOORMAN,239,"You can't go into the unit.  Police
orders."
240,JACK (V.O.),240,How embarrassing.
241,DOORMAN,241,Do you have somebody you can call?
242,JACK (V.O.),242,"The police would later tell me that
the pilot light might have gone
out... letting out just a little bit
of gas."
243,DOORMAN,243,"Lots of young people try to impress
the world and buy too many things."
244,JACK (V.O.),244,"The gas could have slowly filled the
condo.  Seventeen-hundred square feet
with high ceilings, for days and days."
245,DOORMAN,245,"Many young people feel trapped and
desperate."
246,JACK (V.O.),246,"Then, the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on..."
247,DOORMAN,247,"If you don't know what you want, you
end up with a lot you don't."
248,JACK (V.O.),248,"If you asked me now, I couldn't tell
you why I called him."
249,JACK,249,Hello?
250,TYLER'S VOICE,250,Who's this?
251,JACK,251,Tyler?
252,TYLER'S VOICE,252,Who's this?
253,JACK,253,"Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the
plane.  We had the same briefcase.
I'm... you know, the clever guy."
254,TYLER'S VOICE,254,"Oh, yeah."
255,JACK,255,"I just called a second ago.  There
was no answer.  I'm at a payphone."
256,TYLER'S VOICE,256,"I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick
up my phone.  What's up?"
257,JACK,257,"Well... let me see... here's the
thing..."
258,JACK,258,"You buy furniture.  You tell
yourself: this is the last sofa I'll
ever need.  No matter what else
happens, I've got the sofa issue
handled.  Then, the right set of
dishes.  The right dinette."
259,TYLER,259,This is how we fill up our lives.
260,JACK,260,I guess so.
261,TYLER,261,"And, now it's gone."
262,JACK,262,All gone.
263,TYLER,263,"Could be worse.  A woman could cut
off your penis while you're asleep
and toss it out the window of a
moving car."
264,JACK,264,There's always that.
265,TYLER,265,"I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe
it's a terrible tragedy."
266,JACK,266,...no ...no ...
267,TYLER,267,"I mean, you did lose a lot of nice,
neat little shit.  The trendy paper
lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit,
am I right?"
268,TYLER,268,"But maybe, just maybe, you've been
delivered."
269,JACK,269,Delivered from Swedish furniture.
270,TYLER,270,"Delivered from armchairs in obscure
green stripe patterns."
271,JACK,271,Delivered from Martha Stewart.
272,TYLER,272,"Delivered from bullshit colors like
""Cobalt,"" ""Ebony,"" and ""Fuchsia."""
273,JACK,273,Insurance'll cover it.
274,TYLER,274,"Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the
list."
275,JACK,275,What list?
276,TYLER,276,"The ""now I get to go out and buy the
exact same stuff all over again""
list.  That list."
277,JACK,277,I don't... think so.
278,TYLER,278,"This time maybe get a widescreen TV.
You'll be occupied for weeks."
279,JACK,279,"Well, I have to file a claim..."
280,TYLER,280,"The things you own, they end up
owning you."
281,JACK,281,Don't I?
282,TYLER,282,Do what you like.
283,JACK,283,"God, it's late.  I should find a
hotel..."
284,TYLER,284,A hotel?
285,JACK,285,Yeah.
286,TYLER,286,"So, you called me up, because you
just wanted to have a drink before
you... go find a hotel?"
287,JACK,287,I don't follow...
288,TYLER,288,"We're on our third pitcher of beer.
Just ask me."
289,JACK,289,Huh?
290,TYLER,290,"You called me so you could have a
place to stay."
291,JACK,291,"No, I..."
292,TYLER,292,"Why don't you cut the shit and ask if
you can stay at my place?"
293,JACK,293,Would that be a problem?
294,TYLER,294,Is it a problem for you to ask?
295,JACK,295,Can I stay at your place?
296,TYLER,296,"Yes, you can."
297,JACK,297,Thank you.
298,TYLER,298,"You're welcome.  But, I want you to
do me one favor."
299,JACK,299,What's that?
300,TYLER,300,"I want you to hit me as hard as you
can."
301,JACK,301,What?
302,TYLER,302,"I want you to hit me as hard as you
can."
303,JACK (V.O.),303,"Let me tell you a little bit about
Tyler Durden."
304,JACK,304,"Tyler was a night person.  He
sometimes worked as a projectionist.
A movie doesn't come in one big reel,
it's on a few.  In old theaters, two
projectors are used, so someone has
to change projectors at the exact
second when one reel ends and
another reel begins.  Sometimes you
can see two dots on screen in the
upper right hand corner..."
305,TYLER,305,"They're called ""cigarette burns."""
306,JACK,306,"It's called a ""changeover.""  The
movie goes on, and nobody in the
audience has any idea."
307,TYLER,307,Why would anyone want this shitty job?
308,JACK,308,"It affords him other interesting
opportunities."
309,TYLER,309,"-- Like splicing single frames from
adult movies into family films."
310,JACK,310,"In reel three, right after the
courageous dog and the snooty cag --
who have celebrity voices -- eat out
of a garbage can, there's the flash
of Tyler's contribution..."
311,TYLER,311,"One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's
how long it's up there."
312,JACK,312,"No one really knows that they've seen it.
But they did."
313,TYLER,313,"A nice, big cock."
314,JACK,314,"Only a hummingbird could have caught
Tyler at work."
315,JACK,315,"Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter
at the luxurious Pressman Hotel."
316,JACK,316,"He was the guerrilla terrorist of the
food service industry."
317,TYLER,317,Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
318,TYLER,318,"... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah."
319,JACK,319,"He farted on meringue; he sneezed on
braised endive; and, with creme of
mushroom soup, well..."
320,TYLER (O.S.),320,Go ahead.  Say it.
321,JACK,321,You get the idea.
322,JACK,322,I don't know about this.
323,TYLER,323,"I don't know, either.  I want to find
out.  I've never been hit, have you?"
324,JACK,324,"No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?"
325,TYLER,325,"I don't want to die without any
scars.  How much can you really know
about yourself if you've never been
in a fight?  Come on... you're the
only person I've ever asked."
326,JACK,326,Me?
327,TYLER,327,"Why not you?  I'm letting you go
first.  Do it."
328,JACK,328,This is crazy.
329,TYLER,329,"Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip."
330,JACK,330,Where do you want it?  In the face?
331,TYLER,331,Surprise me.
332,JACK,332,Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
333,TYLER,333,Like hell.  That counted.
334,TYLER,334,How do you feel?
335,JACK,335,Strange.
336,TYLER,336,But a good strange.
337,JACK,337,Is it?
338,TYLER,338,"We've crossed the threshold.  You
want to call it off?"
339,JACK,339,Call what off?
340,TYLER,340,The fight.
341,JACK,341,What fight?
342,TYLER,342,"This fight, pussy."
343,TYLER,343,"If you could fight anyone... one on
one, whoever you wanted, who would
you fight?"
344,JACK,344,Anyone?
345,TYLER,345,Anyone.
346,JACK,346,"My boss, probably."
347,JACK,347,Who would you fight?
348,TYLER,348,My dad.  No question.
349,JACK,349,"Oh, yeah."
350,JACK,350,"I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew
him, till I was six.  He went and
married another woman, had more kids.
Every six years or so he'd do it
again -- new city, new family."
351,TYLER,351,"He was setting up franchises.  My
father never went to college, so it
was really important that I go."
352,JACK,352,I know that.
353,TYLER,353,"After I graduated, I called him long
distance and asked, ""Now what?""  He
said, ""Get a job.""  When I turned
twenty-five, I called him and asked,
""Now what?""  He said, ""I don't know.
Get married."""
354,JACK,354,Same here.
355,TYLER,355,"A generation of men raised by women.
I'm wondering if another woman is the
answer we really need."
356,JACK,356,We should do this again sometime.
357,JACK,357,Where's your car?
358,TYLER,358,What car?
359,JACK (V.O.),359,"I don't know how Tyler found the
house, but he'd been there for half
a year."
360,JACK (V.O.),360,"It looked like it was waiting to be
torn down.  Most of the windows were
boarded up."
361,JACK (V.O.),361,"None of the doors locked.  The stairs
were ready to collapse.  I didn't
know if he owned it or he was
squatting."
362,JACK (V.O.),362,Neither would have surprised me.
363,JACK (V.O.),363,"Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing
leaked.  Turning on a light meant
another light in the house went out."
364,JACK (V.O.),364,"There were no neighbors.  Just
warehouses and the paper mill.  The
fart smell of steam, the hamster cage
smell of wood chips."
365,JACK (V.O.),365,"At night, Tyler and I were alone for
half a mile in every direction."
366,JACK (V.O.),366,"When it rained, we had to kill the
power.  By the end of the first
month, I didn't care about TV.  I
didn't mind the warm, stale
refrigerator."
367,JACK (V.O.),367,"The previous occupant had been a bit
of a shut-in."
368,TYLER,368,Hum.
369,JACK,369,What?
370,TYLER,370,"Oh, a new riot control grenade..."
371,TYLER,371,"""...the successful combination of
concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash-
blasts and simultaneous high-velocity
disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."""
372,JACK,372,"""I am Joe's Lungs.""  It's written in
first person.  ""Without me, Joe could
not take in oxygen to feed his red
blood cells.""  There's a whole
series -- ""I am Joe's Prostate."""
373,TYLER,373,"""I get cancer, and I kill Joe."""
374,JACK,374,What are you reading?
375,TYLER,375,"Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week.
New Republic."
376,JACK,376,Show-off.
377,JACK (V.O.),377,"I should have been haggling with my
insurance company.  I should have
been looking for a new condo..."
378,JACK (V.O.),378,".... I should have been upset about
my nice, neat, flaming little shit."
379,JACK (V.O.),379,But I wasn't.
380,JACK (V.O.),380,"Most of the week, we were Ozzie and
Harriet."
381,JACK (V.O.),381,"But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday
night..."
382,JACK (V.O.),382,"... we were finding something out: we
were finding out, more and more, that
we were not alone."
383,JACK (V.O.),383,"Thursday mornings, all I could do was
think about next week."
384,WALTER,384,"The basic premise of cyber-netting
your office is -- make things more
efficient."
385,BOSS,385,Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
386,WALTER,386,Absolutely.
387,JACK (V.O.),387,"Walter, the Microsoft account exec.
Walter, with his smooth, soft hands.
Maybe he was thinking about the free-
range potluck he'd been to last
weekend, or his church-group car-wash
fund-raiser.  Or, probably not."
388,WALTER,388,"I showed this already to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?"
389,JACK (V.O.),389,"You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick."
390,WALTER,390,"Jesus, I'd hate to see what happened
to the other guy."
391,JACK (V.O.),391,"Screw Walter.  His candy-ass wouldn't
last a second Wednesday night."
392,IRVINE,392,Drink up people.  We're closing.
393,JACK (V.O.),393,"It was right in everyone's face.
Tyler and I just made it visible."
394,JACK (V.O.),394,"It was on the tip of everyone's
tongue.  Tyler and I just gave it a
name."
395,TYLER,395,Welcome to fight club.
396,JACK (V.O.),396,"Every week, Tyler gave the rules that
he and I decided."
397,TYLER,397,"The first rule of fight club is --
you don't talk about fight club.  The
second rule of fight club is -- you
don't talk about fight club.  The
third rule of fight club is -- when
someone says ""stop"" or goes limp, the
fight is over.  Fourth rule is --
only two guys to a fight.  Fifth
rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth
rule -- no shirts, no shoes.  Seventh
rule -- fights go on as long as they
have to.  And the eighth and final
rule -- if this is your first night
at fight club, you have to fight."
398,JACK (V.O.),398,"This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk --
couldn't remember whether you ordered
pens with blue ink or black ink ..."
399,JACK (V.O.),399,"But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
last week when he trounced an actuary
twice his size."
400,JACK (V.O.),400,"Sometimes all you could hear were
flat, hard packing sounds over the
yelling, or the wet choke when
someone caught their breath and
sprayed..."
401,GOATEED MAN,401,Ssssstop... !
402,JACK (V.O.),402,"Even if I could tell someone they had
a good fight, I wouldn't be talking
to the same man."
403,JACK (V.O.),403,"Who you were in fight club is not who
you were in the rest of the world."
404,JACK (V.O.),404,"You weren't alive anywhere like you
were there.  But fight club only
exists in the hours between when
fight club starts and when fight club
ends."
405,BOSS,405,"What are you getting yourself into
every week?"
406,JACK (V.O.),406,"After fight club, everything else in
your life gets the volume turned
down.  You can deal with anything."
407,BOSS,407,Have you finished those reports?
408,JACK,408,Yes.
409,JACK (V.O.),409,"The people who had power over you
have less and less."
410,JACK (V.O.),410,"By this point, I could wiggle most of
the teeth in my jaw."
411,JACK (V.O.),411,"A guy came to fight club for the
first time, his ass was a wad of
cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he
was carved out of wood."
412,JACK,412,If you could fight any celebrity?
413,TYLER,413,Alive or dead?
414,JACK,414,Doesn't matter.
415,TYLER,415,Hemingway.  You?
416,JACK,416,Shatner.  William Shatner.
417,JACK (V.O.),417,"We all started seeing things
differently.  Wherever we went."
418,JACK (V.O.),418,"I felt sorry for all the guys packing
into gyms, trying to look like what
Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said
they should."
419,TYLER,419,"Self-improvement is masturbation.
Self-destruction is the answer."
420,JACK,420,You could take him.
421,TYLER,421,The trick is not to care.
422,JACK (V.O.),422,"Fight club wasn't about winning or
losing.  It wasn't about words."
423,JACK (V.O.),423,"They hysterical shouting was in
tongues, like at a Pentecostal church."
424,JACK,424,... stop...
425,JACK (V.O.),425,"When the fight was over, nothing was
solved, but nothing mattered."
426,TYLER,426,Cool.
427,OPPONENT,427,How about next week?
428,JACK,428,Look at me.  How about next month?
429,JACK (V.O.),429,"Afterwards, we all felt saved."
430,TYLER,430,He fell down some stairs.
431,JACK,431,I fell down some stairs.
432,JACK (V.O.),432,Sometimes Tyler spoke for me.
433,JACK (V.O.),433,"Fight club became the reason to cut
your hair short and trim your
fingernails."
434,TYLER,434,Any historical figure.
435,JACK,435,Okay... Ghandi.
436,TYLER,436,Good answer.
437,JACK,437,You?
438,TYLER,438,"Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys
fight till they're burger."
439,TYLER,439,"Remember, even the Mona Lisa's
falling apart."
440,JACK,440,Hello?
441,MARLA,441,"Where have you been the last few
weeks?"
442,JACK,442,Marla?
443,JACK,443,How did you find me?
444,MARLA,444,"The forwarding number.  I haven't
seen you at any support groups."
445,JACK,445,That's the idea -- we split them.
446,MARLA,446,You haven't been going to yours.
447,JACK,447,I found a new one.
448,MARLA,448,Really?
449,JACK,449,It's for men.
450,MARLA,450,Like testicular cancer?
451,JACK,451,"Look, this is a bad time..."
452,MARLA,452,"I've been going to debtor's
anonymous.  You want to see some
truly fucked up people?"
453,JACK,453,I'm just on my way out...
454,MARLA,454,"Me too.  I got a stomach full of
Xanax.  I took what was left of a
bottle.  Might've been too much."
455,JACK (V.O.),455,"Picture yourself watching Marla
Singer throw herself around her
crummy apartment."
456,MARLA,456,"This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably one of those cry-for-
help things."
457,JACK (V.O.),457,This could go on for hours.
458,JACK,458,So you're staying in tonight?
459,MARLA,459,"Do you want to wait to hear me
describe death?"
460,MARLA'S VOICE,460,"Do you want to listen and see if my
spirit can use the telephone?"
461,JACK (V.O.),461,"Tyler's door was closed.  I'd been
living here two months, and Tyler's
door was never closed."
462,JACK,462,"You're not going to believe what I
dreamt last night."
463,MARLA,463,"I can hardly believe anything about
last night."
464,JACK,464,What are you doing here?
465,MARLA,465,What... ?
466,JACK,466,What the hell are you doing here?
467,MARLA,467,Fuck you.
468,TYLER,468,"She's a piece of work.  Get this --
I come in here last night, the
phone's off the hook..."
469,JACK (V.O.),469,"I already knew the story before he
told it to me."
470,MARLA'S VOICE,470,"I'll tell you when I'm floating out
of my body."
471,JACK (V.O.),471,"How could Tyler, off all people, think
it was a bad thing that Marla Singer
was about to die?"
472,MARLA,472,You got here fast.
473,MARLA,473,"The mattresses are all sealed in
slippery plastic."
474,MARLA,474,Did I call you?
475,MARLA,475,Don't worry.  It's not a threat to you.
476,MARLA,476,"Oh, no!  Somebody called the cops..."
477,COP,477,8-G!  Where's 8-G?
478,MARLA,478,End of the hall.
479,MARLA,479,"The girl who lives there used to be
a charming, lovely girl, but she's
lost faith in herself..."
480,COP,480,"Miss Singer, let us help you!  You
have every reason to live!"
481,MARLA,481,"She's a monster!  Infectious human
waste!  Good luck trying to save her!"
482,MARLA,482,"If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
You're gonna have to keep me up all
night."
483,TYLER,483,"Unbelievable, huh?"
484,JACK (V.O.),484,He was obviously able to handle it.
485,TYLER,485,"I mean, this girl... uh, you're not
into her or anything... ?"
486,JACK,486,No.  Not at all.
487,JACK (V.O.),487,I am Jack's Raging Bile Duct.
488,TYLER,488,You're sure?
489,JACK,489,"Yeah, I'm sure."
490,TYLER,490,"Good.  This chick was up on the table
with her legs in the stirrups before
the doctor even walked in the room.
The things that she said... I've
never heard a woman talk like that..."
491,MARLA,491,I want to have your abortion.
492,JACK (V.O.),492,"How could Tyler not go for that?
Night before last, he was splicing
sex organs into ""Little Mermaid."""
493,TYLER,493,You're okay with this?
494,JACK,494,I'm fine.
495,JACK (V.O.),495,"Put a gun to my head and paint the
wall with my brains."
496,TYLER,496,"She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay
away from that one."
497,JACK,497,"Oh, and my pace is more librarians."
498,TYLER,498,Hey... don't knock librarians.
499,JACK,499,"Marla doesn't need a lover.  She
needs a case worker."
500,TYLER,500,"She needs an exorcist.  This isn't
love.  This is sport-fucking."
501,JACK (V.O.),501,"She'd invaded my support groups, now
she's invading my home."
502,TYLER,502,"Listen... do me a favor... sit here
a minute..."
503,JACK,503,What?
504,TYLER,504,"You've gotta understand something
about me.  I have a little rule,
okay?  Don't ever talk to her about
me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind
of shit."
505,TYLER,505,"If you ever say anything about me or
about what happens here in this
house, to her or anyone -- I will
find out.  And you'll never see me
again.  Promise me."
506,JACK,506,Okay.
507,TYLER,507,Promise you won't.
508,JACK,508,"Yes, I promise."
509,TYLER,509,Promise?
510,JACK,510,I said I promise!
511,TYLER,511,That was three times you promised.
512,JACK (V.O.),512,"If only I had wasted a couple of
minutes and gone to watch Marla die,
none of this would have happened."
513,MARLA'S VOICE,513,Miserable fucking discharge!
514,JACK (V.O.),514,"I could've moved to another room, one
on the third floor -- so I wouldn't
have heard them.  But I didn't."
515,TYLER,515,What are you doing?
516,JACK,516,I... uh... just going to bed.
517,TYLER,517,You want to finish her off?
518,JACK,518,Uh... nah...
519,JACK (V.O.),519,"I became the calm, little center of
the world.  I was the Zen master."
520,JACK (V.O.),520,I wrote little haiku poems.
521,JACK (V.O.),521,I faxed them around to everyone.
522,BOSS,522,Is that your blood?
523,JACK,523,"Some of it, yes."
524,BOSS,524,"Take the rest of the day off.  Come
back tomorrow with clean clothes.
Get yourself together."
525,JACK (V.O.),525,"I got right in everyone's hostile
little face.  Yes, these are bruises
from fighting.  I'm comfortable with
them.  I am enlightened."
526,JACK (V.O.),526,"You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,
go live in a dilapidated house in the
toxic waste part of town..."
527,JACK (V.O.),527,... and you come home to this.
528,TYLER'S VOICE,528,You fucking slut!!
529,MARLA'S VOICE,529,"Thank you, sir, may I have another!
Thank you sir, may I have another... !"
530,JACK,530,Yeah.  Speaking.
531,DETECTIVE STERN,531,"This is Detective Stern with the
arson unit.  We have some new
information about the ""incident"" at
your condo."
532,JACK,532,Yes?
533,DETECTIVE STERN,533,"I don't know if you're aware... your
front door -- it seems someone
sprayed freon into the lock, then
tapped it with a chisel to shatter
the cylinder."
534,JACK,534,"No, I wasn't aware..."
535,JACK (V.O.),535,I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
536,DETECTIVE STERN,536,Does this sound strange to you?
537,JACK,537,"Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange."
538,DETECTIVE STERN,538,The dynamite...
539,JACK,539,Dynamite?
540,DETECTIVE STERN,540,"Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium
oxalate and potassium perchloride.
Do you know what that means?"
541,JACK,541,What does that mean?
542,DETECTIVE STERN,542,It means it was homemade.
543,JACK,543,This is... really a shock...
544,DETECTIVE STERN,544,"Whoever set this homemade dynamite
could've blown out the pilot light
days before the explosion.  The gas,
it seems, was just a detonator."
545,JACK,545,Who do you think could've done this?
546,DETECTIVE STERN,546,"I'll ask the questions, son."
547,TYLER,547,Tell him...
548,JACK,548,Huh?
549,TYLER,549,"""The liberator who destroyed my
property has re-aligned my paradigm
of perception."""
550,JACK,550,Shhhhhh!
551,JACK,551,"I don't know what to make of this,
sir, I really don't..."
552,DETECTIVE STERN,552,"Do you know anyone who'd have the
expertise or motive to do something
like this?"
553,TYLER,553,"""I reject the basic assumptions of
civilization, including material
possession."""
554,JACK,554,"No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo.
I loved every stick of furniture.
The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were
me.  The dishes were me.  The plants
were..."
555,JACK (V.O.),555,I'd like to thank the academy...
556,DETECTIVE STERN,556,"Well, if any ideas come to you, give
me a call.  In the meantime, don't
leave town.  I may need to bring you
in for questioning."
557,TYLER,557,"Could be worse.  You could be cursed
with the three terrible Karmas.  You
could be beautiful, rich and famous."
558,JACK (V.O.),558,"Except for their humping, Tyler and
Marla were never in the same room."
559,MARLA,559,"I got this dress at a thrift store
for one dollar."
560,JACK,560,Worth every penny.
561,JACK (V.O.),561,"My parents pulled this exact act for
years -- one came in, the other
disappeared."
562,MARLA,562,"It's a bridesmaid's dress.  Someone
loved it intensely for one day, then
tossed it.  Like a Christmas tree --
so special, then, bam -- it's
abandoned on the side of the road,
tinsel still clinging to it..."
563,MARLA,563,"Like sex crime victims, underwear
inside-out, bound with electrical
tape."
564,JACK,564,It suits you.
565,MARLA,565,You can borrow it sometime.
566,TYLER (O.S.),566,Get rid of her.
567,JACK,567,You get rid of her.
568,TYLER,568,Don't mention me.
569,JACK (V.O.),569,"I'm six years old again, passing
messages between my parents."
570,JACK,570,"I, uh... think you should go now."
571,JACK,571,It's time for you to leave.
572,MARLA,572,"Don't worry, I'm leaving."
573,MARLA,573,"You're such a nutcase, I can't even
begin to keep up."
574,JACK,574,Goodbye.
575,TYLER (O.S.),575,Nice work.
576,TYLER,576,"To make soap, first we have to render
fat."
577,TYLER,577,"The best fat for making soap --
because the salt balance is just
right -- comes form human bodies..."
578,JACK,578,What is this place?
579,TYLER,579,A liposuction clinic.
580,TYLER,580,"Paydirt.  From society's richest
asses and thighs."
581,TYLER,581,"As the fat renders, the tallow floats
to the surface.  Remember the crap
they taught you in Boy Scouts."
582,JACK,582,Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
583,TYLER,583,"This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll
mix it back in when we make the soap."
584,TYLER,584,Lye -- the crucial ingredient.
585,TYLER,585,"Ancient peoples found their clothes
got cleaner if they washed them at a
certain spot in the river.  Why?
Because, human sacrifices were once
made on the hills above this river.
Year after year, bodies burnt.  Rain
feel.  Water seeped through the wood
ashes to become lye.  The lye
combined with the melted fat of the
bodies, till a thick white soapy
discharge crept into the river."
586,TYLER,586,"The first soap was made from the
ashes of heroes.  Like the first
monkeys shot into space."
587,TYLER,587,"Without sacrifice, without death, we
would have nothing."
588,TYLER,588,"This is a chemical burn.  It will
hurt more than you've ever been
burned and you will have a scar."
589,JACK (V.O.),589,"Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the
back of my hand."
590,TYLER,590,Look at your hand.
591,JACK (V.O.),591,"Guided meditation worked for cancer,
it could work for this."
592,TYLER,592,"Come back to the pain.  Don't shut
this out."
593,JACK (V.O.),593,"I tried not to think of the words
""searing"" or ""flesh.""  I imagined my
pain as a ball of healing white light."
594,TYLER,594,"Stop it.  This is your pain -- your
burning hand.  It's right here.  Look
at it."
595,JACK (V.O.),595,"I was going to my cave to find my
power animal."
596,TYLER,596,"Don't deal with this the way those
dead people do.  Deal with it the way
a living person does."
597,JACK,597,"I... I think I understand.  I think
I get it..."
598,TYLER,598,"No, what you're feeling is premature
enlightenment."
599,TYLER,599,"This is the greatest moment of your
life and you're off somewhere,
missing it."
600,JACK,600,"No, I'm not..."
601,TYLER,601,"Shut up.  Our fathers were our models
for God.  And, if our fathers bailed,
what does that tell us about God?"
602,JACK,602,I don't know...
603,TYLER,603,"Listen to me.  You have to consider
the possibility that God doesn't like
you, he never wanted you.  In all
probability, He hates you.  This is
not the worst thing that can happen..."
604,JACK,604,It isn't... ?
605,TYLER,605,We don't need him...
606,JACK,606,We don't... ?
607,JACK,607,... Marla ... ?
608,TYLER,608,"Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We
are God's unwanted children, with no
special place and no special
attention, and so be it."
609,TYLER,609,"You can go to the sink and run water
over your hand.  Look at me.  Or you
can use vinegar to neutralize the
burn, but first you have to give up.
First, you have to know that someday,
you are going to die.  Until you know
that, you will be useless."
610,JACK,610,"You ... you don't know what this
feels like, Tyler."
611,TYLER,611,"Congratulations.  You're a step
closer to hitting bottom."
612,JACK (V.O.),612,"Tyler sold the soap to department
stores at twenty bucks a Ear.  God
knows what they charged.  How ironic.
We were selling rich women their own
fat asses back to them."
613,JACK (V.O.),613,"He was wearing a yellow tie.  It must
be Thursday.  I didn't even wear a tie
to work anymore."
614,BOSS,614,"""The first rule of fight club is you
don't talk about fight club."""
615,JACK (V.O.),615,"I must've left the original in the
copy machine."
616,BOSS,616,"""The second rule of fight club...
Is this yours?"
617,JACK,617,Hmm?
618,BOSS,618,"You don't get paid to abuse the copy
machine."
619,JACK,619,"""Abuse"" the copy machine.  There's an
image."
620,BOSS,620,"Pretend you're me.  You find this.
What would you do?"
621,JACK,621,"Me? I'd be very careful who I talked
to about this.  It sounds like
someone dangerous wrote it... someone
who might snap at any moment,
stalking from office to office with
an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas
semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round
after round into colleagues and co-
workers."
622,JACK,622,"Might be someone you've known for
years... somebody very close to you.
Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing
me every little piece of trash you
pick up."
623,JACK,623,Compliance and Liability.
624,MARLA'S VOICE,624,My tit's going to rot off.
625,JACK,625,Just a second.
626,JACK,626,"Could you excuse me?  I need to take
this call."
627,JACK,627,What are you talking about?
628,MARLA,628,"Would you do something for me?  I
need you to check and see if there's
a lump in my breast.  I can't afford
to throw money away on a doctor."
629,JACK,629,I don't know ...
630,MARLA,630,Please.
631,JACK (V.O.),631,"She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral
in her book."
632,JACK,632,"This is a sweet side of you.  Picking
these up for ..."
633,JACK,633,"""Mrs. Haniver"" and... ""Mrs. Raines.""
Where are they?"
634,MARLA,634,"Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive
and I'm in poverty.  You want any?"
635,JACK,635,"No, thanks."
636,MARLA,636,Good.
637,MARLA,637,What happened to your hand?
638,JACK,638,Nothing.
639,JACK,639,Where?  Here?
640,MARLA,640,Here.
641,JACK,641,There?
642,MARLA,642,Here.
643,JACK,643,Here.
644,MARLA,644,Feel anything?
645,JACK,645,No.
646,MARLA,646,Make sure.
647,JACK,647,"Okay.  Okay, I'm sure."
648,MARLA,648,You feel nothing?
649,JACK,649,Nothing.
650,MARLA,650,"Well, that's a relief.  Thank you."
651,JACK,651,No... no problem.
652,MARLA,652,I wish I could return the favor.
653,JACK,653,I think everything's okay here.
654,MARLA,654,I could check your prostate.
655,JACK,655,Uh ... nah.
656,MARLA,656,"Well... thanks, anyway."
657,JACK,657,So.... are we done?
658,MARLA,658,"Yeah, we're done.  See you around."
659,BOB,659,Cornelius!  How are you?
660,JACK,660,Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
661,BOB,661,Better than I've ever been in my life.
662,JACK,662,"Really?  Great.  Still ""Remaining Men
Together?"""
663,BOB,663,No.  I found something new.
664,JACK,664,"Really, what's that?"
665,BOB,665,"The first rule is... you aren't
supposed to talk about it..."
666,JACK,666,Oh.
667,BOB,667,"And the second rule about it is...
you're not supposed to talk about it.
And the third rule..."
668,JACK,668,"Bob, Bob... I'm a member."
669,BOB,669,You are?!
670,JACK,670,Look at my face.
671,BOB,671,"That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking
great! Congratulations."
672,JACK,672,"Yeah, both of us."
673,BOB,673,"You know about the guy who invented
it? I hear all kinds of things.
Supposedly, he was born in a mental
institution.  They say he only sleeps
one hour a night.  You know about
this guy?  Tyler Durden?"
674,BOB,674,Thank you.  Thank you.
675,JACK,675,You're welcome.
676,JACK (V.O.),676,"Fight club -- this was mine and
Tyler's gift... our gift to the world."
677,TYLER,677,"No thanks, I quit."
678,JACK,678,You quit?
679,TYLER,679,Yeah.  Where you headed?
680,JACK,680,Work.  Going to work.
681,JACK,681,What... ?
682,TYLER,682,Nothing.  Do what you like.
683,JACK,683,We need to talk.
684,BOSS,684,"Okay.  Where to begin?  With your
constant absenteeism?  With your
unpresentable appearance?  You're up
for review..."
685,JACK,685,I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
686,JACK,686,"Let's pretend.  You're the Department
of Transportation, and you discover
that our company intentionally did
nothing about leather seats cured in
third world countries with chemicals
we know cause birth defects?  Brake
linings that fail after a thousand
miles.  Fuel injectors that burn
people alive."
687,BOSS,687,"Just who the fuck do you think you
are?!  Get out!  You're fired!"
688,JACK,688,"What about this?  Keep me on payroll
as an outside consultant.  In
exchange for my salary, I'll keep my
mouth shut.  I won't need to come to
the office.  I can do this job from
home."
689,BOSS,689,You little fucker!  I oughta...
690,JACK (V.O.),690,I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge.
691,JACK,691,"Please... don't hit me again, please.
I'm your responsibility..."
692,JACK (V.O.),692,"For some reason, I thought of my
first fight -- with Tyler."
693,JACK,693,"Please... give me the paychecks like
I asked for.  I won't be any trouble.
You won't see me again."
694,JACK (V.O.),694,"Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,
something horrible had been growing."
695,JACK,695,Please... please...
696,JACK (V.O.),696,"And right then, at our most excellent
moment together..."
697,JACK,697,Please don't hit me again.
698,JACK,698,Six months advance pay.  Six months!
699,TYLER,699,Fucking sweet.
700,JACK,700,"Okay, and... and..."
701,JACK,701,"Forty-eight airline flight coupons.
Plus... hold on... just a minute..."
702,JACK,702,I am now officially self-employed.
703,TYLER,703,Good for you.
704,TYLER,704,"I look around... I look around and
see a lot of new faces."
705,TYLER,705,"Shut up!  Which means a lot of you
have been breaking the first two
rules of fight club."
706,TYLER,706,"I see in fight club the strongest and
smartest men who have ever lived --
an entire generation pumping gas and
waiting tables; or they're slaves
with white collars."
707,"(more)
TYLER (cont)",707,"Advertisements have them chasing cars
and clothes, working jobs they hate
so they can buy shit they don't need.
We are the middle children of
history, with no purpose or place.
We have no great war, or great
depression.  The great war is a
spiritual war.  The great depression
is our lives.  We were raised by
television to believe that we'd be
millionaires and movie gods and rock
stars -- but we won't.  And we're
learning that fact.  And we're very,
very pissed-off."
708,TYLER,708,"We are the quiet young men who listen
until it's time to decide."
709,TYLER,709,Who are you?
710,FAT MAN (LOU),710,"Who am I?!  There's a sign on the
front that says ""Lou's Tavern."" I'm
fucking Lou.  Who the fuck are you?!"
711,TYLER,711,Tyler Durden.
712,LOU,712,"Who told you motherfuckers you could
use my place?"
713,TYLER,713,We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
714,LOU,714,"Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a
broken collarbone."
715,LOU,715,"He don't own this place, I do.  How
much money's he getting for this?"
716,TYLER,716,There is no money.
717,LOU,717,Really?
718,TYLER,718,It's free to all.
719,LOU,719,Ain't that something?
720,TYLER,720,"Yes, it is."
721,LOU,721,"Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone
outta here now!"
722,TYLER,722,You're welcome to join our club.
723,LOU,723,Did you hear what I just said?!
724,TYLER,724,You and your friend.
725,LOU,725,You hear me now?
726,TYLER,726,"No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
727,TYLER,727,We really need to use this place.
728,TYLER,728,"That's it.... that's good.  Get it
all out.  You'll feel better."
729,TYLER,729,"Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and
this whole fucking world..."
730,TYLER,730,You don't know where I've been.
731,TYLER,731,"We need this place.  We need it.
Please let us keep it, please..."
732,LOU,732,What are you doing?!
733,TYLER,733,Pleeeeeease!
734,LOU,734,"Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the
basement!  Get off me!"
735,TYLER,735,"We need some towels, Lou.  We need
replacement light bulbs."
736,LOU,736,"Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!"
737,TYLER,737,"Thank you.  Thank you, sir..."
738,LOU,738,Let go of me!!
739,TYLER,739,"This week, each of you has a homework
assignment.  You're going to go out
and start a fight with a total
stranger..."
740,TYLER,740,"You're going to start a fight... and
you're going to lose."
741,JACK (V.O.),741,"Not as easy as it sounds.  People'll
do just about anything to avoid a
fight."
742,YUPPIE,742,"Hey!  Wha... What the hell... what
are you doing?!  Who are you?!!"
743,YUPPIE,743,"Get away from me!  Keep away!
NO... !"
744,YUPPIE,744,"Who are you!?  Why are you attacking
me... ?!"
745,FIRST MAN,745,Hey... hey...
746,SECOND MAN,746,"Watch out, jackass!"
747,SEMINARIAN,747,You... you did that on purpose!
748,JACK (V.O.),748,"Now nobody was the center of fight
club except the two men fighting.
The leader walked around in the
crowd, out in the darkness."
749,JACK (V.O.),749,Everyone took a homework assignment.
750,JACK,750,There's fight club in Delaware City.
751,TYLER,751,"I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights."
752,JACK,752,"Local 8 just started in Penns Grove.
And, Bob said he was at fight club in
Newcastle last week."
753,TYLER,753,Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
754,JACK,754,I thought you did.
755,TYLER,755,Let me have that a minute...
756,JACK,756,What are we doing?
757,TYLER,757,Homework assignment.
758,JACK,758,What is it?
759,TYLER,759,Human Sacrifice.
760,JACK (V.O.),760,"On a long enough time line, the
survival rate for everyone drops to
zero."
761,CLERK,761,Please... don't...
762,TYLER,762,Give me your wallet.
763,TYLER,763,"Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning,
apartment A.  A small, cramped
basement apartment."
764,RAYMOND,764,How'd you know?
765,TYLER,765,"They give basement apartments letters
instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're
going to die."
766,TYLER,766,Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
767,RAYMOND,767,Yesssss...
768,TYLER,768,"Your mom and dad will have to call
kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up
your dental records, because there
won't be much left of your face."
769,RAYMOND,769,"Please, God, no..."
770,JACK,770,Tyler...
771,TYLER,771,"An expired community college student
ID card.  What did you used to study,
Raymond K. Hessel?"
772,RAYMOND,772,S-S-Stuff.
773,TYLER,773,"""Stuff.""  Were the mid-terms hard?"
774,TYLER,774,I asked you what you studied.
775,JACK,775,Tell him!
776,RAYMOND,776,"Biology, mostly."
777,TYLER,777,Why?
778,RAYMOND,778,I... I don't know...
779,TYLER,779,"What did you want to be, Raymond K.
Hessel?"
780,TYLER,780,"The question, Raymond, was ""what did
you want to be?"""
781,JACK,781,Answer him!
782,RAYMOND,782,A veterinarian!
783,TYLER,783,Animals.
784,RAYMOND,784,Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
785,TYLER,785,"Stuff.  That means you have to get
more schooling."
786,RAYMOND,786,Too much school.
787,TYLER,787,Would you rather be dead?
788,RAYMOND,788,"No, please, no, God, no!"
789,RAYMOND,789,NOOOOO!
790,TYLER,790,"I'm keeping your license.  I know
where you live.  I'm going to check
on you.  If you aren't back in school
and on your way to being a
veterinarian in six weeks, you will
be dead.  Get the hell out of here."
791,JACK,791,I feel sick.
792,TYLER,792,Imagine how he feels.
793,JACK,793,"I don't care, that was horrible."
794,TYLER,794,"Tomorrow will be the most beautiful
day of Raymond K. Hessell's life."
795,TYLER,795,"His breakfast will taste better than
any meal he has ever eaten."
796,TYLER,796,"... You are not how much money you
have in the bank.  You are not the
shoes you wear."
797,TYLER,797,"You are not the contents of your
wallet..."
798,JACK (V.O.),798,"He had a plan.  Maybe you just didn't
see it till it hit you between the
eyes."
799,JACK (V.O.),799,"But, it started to make sense... in
a Tyler sort of way.  No fear.  No
distractions.  The ability to let
that which does not matter truly
slide."
800,JACK,800,Hey.
801,TYLER,801,Hey.
802,TYLER,802,Go on in.  We're celebrating.
803,RICKY,803,You are not your job.
804,OTHERS TOGETHER,804,You are not your job.
805,RICKY,805,"You are not how much money you have
in the bank."
806,BOB,806,"Shhhh, wait... they're back to it..."
807,ANGEL FACE,807,"Great, thanks."
808,BOB,808,Shhhhh!  Watch!
809,REPORTER (V.O.),809,"Police Commissioner Jacobs has just
arrived... just a second... excuse
me, Commissioner, could you tell us
what you think has happened?"
810,COMMISSIONER JACOBS (V.O.),810,"We believe this is related to the
recent acts of vandalism around the
city.  It's some kind of organized
group, and we are coordinating a
rigorous investigation."
811,JACK,811,What did you guys do?
812,BOB,812,"The first rule of Project Mayhem
is... you do not ask questions."
813,TYLER,813,"Wrap it around the top of his hackie-
sack."
814,BOB,814,"Man, his balls are ice cold."
815,TYLER,815,"You're not going to continue your
""rigorous investigation.""  You will
publicly state that there is no
underground group.  Or -- imagine,
the rest of your life with your
scrotum flapping empty."
816,JACOBS,816,"... no... please, no..."
817,TYLER,817,"We'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the Los Angeles Times.
Press release style.  Your nuts will
be bicoastal.  Understood?  The
people you're after are everyone you
depend on."
818,"(more)
TYLER (cont)",818,"We do your laundry, cook your food
and serve you dinner.  We guard you
while you sleep.  We drive your
ambulances.  Do not fuck with us."
819,JACK (V.O.),819,"I felt like putting a bullet between
the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't
screw to save its species."
820,JACK (V.O.),820,"I wanted to open the dump valves on
oil tankers and smother all the
French beaches I'd never see."
821,TYLER,821,"Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?"
822,JACK,822,"I felt like destroying something
beautiful."
823,VALET,823,"There you are, Mr. Durden.  Airport
parking, long term."
824,JACK,824,"After you, Mr. Durden..."
825,TYLER,825,No... after you.
826,TYLER,826,Something on your mind?
827,JACK,827,No.
828,JACK,828,"Why wasn't I told about ""Project
Mayhem?"""
829,TYLER,829,What should I have told you?
830,JACK,830,"Why wasn't I involved from the
beginning?  You and I started fight
club together."
831,TYLER,831,"Fight club was the beginning.  Now
it's out of the basements and there's a
name for it -- Project Mayhem."
832,RICKY AND MECHANIC,832,"The first rule of Project Mayhem is
you do not ask questions."
833,JACK,833,This is as much mine as yours.
834,TYLER,834,"Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it
about you and me?"
835,JACK,835,You know what I mean.
836,TYLER,836,"What do you want?  A statement of
purpose... ?"
837,JACK,837,Look...
838,TYLER,838,"Should I E-mail you?  Should I put
this on your ""action item list?"""
839,JACK,839,I want to know --
840,TYLER,840,"What do you want to know about
Project Mayhem?"
841,RICKY AND MECHANIC,841,The first rule of Project Mayhem --
842,JACK,842,Shut up!!
843,JACK,843,I want to know what's going on.
844,TYLER,844,"This does not belong to us.  We are
not the leaders.  We are not special."
845,JACK,845,What are you doing?!
846,TYLER,846,"We are the all-singing, all-dancing
crap of the world.  We are all part
of the same compost heap..."
847,JACK,847,Tyler...
848,JACK,848,What the hell ... ?!
849,TYLER,849,"You choose your level of involvement.
I won't make decisions for you."
850,JACK,850,I'm not asking you to.
851,TYLER,851,"You're asking questions that don't
have answers.  You know just as much
about Project Mayhem as anybody else."
852,JACK,852,I don't think that's true.
853,JACK,853,Tyler... what is this... !
854,TYLER,854,"What will you wish you'd done before
you died?"
855,RICKY,855,Paint a self-portrait.
856,MECHANIC,856,Build a house.
857,TYLER,857,And you?
858,JACK,858,I don't know!  Nothing!
859,TYLER,859,"If you died right now, how would you
feel about your life?"
860,JACK,860,"I would feel nothing about my life?
Is that what you want to hear?!"
861,TYLER,861,I want to hear the truth.
862,JACK,862,"Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck
you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of
this.  How's that?"
863,TYLER,863,Why do you think I blew up your condo?
864,JACK,864,What?
865,TYLER,865,"Hitting bottom isn't a weekend
retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You
have to forget everything you know,
everything you think you know --
about life, about friendship, about
you and me."
866,JACK,866,"Okay, okay... fine..."
867,JACK (V.O.),867,"I'd never been in a car accident.
This must've been what all those
statistics felt like before I filed
them into my reports."
868,TYLER,868,We just had a near-life experience.
869,TYLER,869,"In the world I see -- you're stalking
elk through the damp canyon forests
around the ruins of Rockefeller
Center.  You will wear leather
clothes that last you the rest of
your life.  You will climb the wrist-
thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears
Tower.  You will see tiny figures
pounding corn and laying-strips of
venison on the empty car pool lane of
the ruins of a superhighway."
870,TYLER,870,"Feel better, champ."
871,MARLA,871,I'll be out of your way in a sec.
872,JACK,872,You... don't have to... leave.
873,MARLA,873,Whatever.
874,JACK,874,Really... I mean it.
875,JACK,875,Have you been going to your groups?
876,MARLA,876,Chloe's dead.
877,JACK,877,When?
878,MARLA,878,Do you care?
879,JACK,879,I don't know.
880,MARLA,880,It was the smart move on her part.
881,JACK,881,"Why are we both... caught up like
this... with... ?"
882,JACK (V.O.),882,"I came so close to saying Tyler's
name, I could feel it vibrate inside
my mouth."
883,JACK,883,"I don't understand.  Why does a weak
person have to go out and find a
strong person... to hang onto?"
884,MARLA,884,What do you get out of it?
885,JACK,885,You hear that?
886,MARLA,886,Hear what?
887,JACK,887,That... sawing and hammering.
888,MARLA,888,"Have we been talking too long?  Must
we change the subject?"
889,TYLER,889,"You're not talking about me, are you?"
890,JACK,890,No.
891,MARLA,891,"That day you came over to my place to
play doctor... what was going on
there?"
892,TYLER,892,What are you talking about?
893,JACK,893,Nothing.
894,MARLA,894,Nothing?  I don't think so.
895,TYLER,895,This conversation...
896,JACK,896,This conversation...
897,TYLER,897,... is over.
898,JACK,898,... is over.
899,MARLA,899,What is this?  Who did this?
900,JACK,900,... A person.
901,MARLA,901,Guy or girl?
902,JACK,902,"Why would you ask if it's a guy or a
girl?!"
903,MARLA,903,Why would you get bent if I asked?
904,JACK,904,Let go of me...
905,JACK,905,Leave me alone.
906,MARLA,906,You're afraid to say.
907,JACK,907,Tyler... ?  What's this for?
908,JACK,908,"Um... what can I do for you, Ricky?"
909,TYLER,909,You're too young.  Sorry.
910,JACK,910,Wait a minute...
911,JACK,911,"""Too young?"""
912,TYLER,912,"If the applicant is young, we tell
him he's too young.  Old, too old.
Fat, too fat."
913,JACK,913,"""Applicant?"""
914,TYLER,914,"If the applicant waits at the door
for three days without food, shelter
or encouragement, then he can enter
and begin training."
915,JACK,915,"""Training?""  Tyler..."
916,JACK,916,"Uh, look.  You're too... young to...
train here.  You should probably be
on you way."
917,JACK,917,"Are you deaf?!  I told you to leave!
You will never get inside this house!"
918,TYLER,918,"Look, friend, I'm sorry for the
misunderstanding.  It's not the end
of the world.  Just go away.  You're
trespassing and I will call the
police.  Nothing personal."
919,JACK,919,"You're never getting through this
door, you stupid little weasel!  Look
at me when I talk to you... !"
920,JACK,920,What is your major malfunction!?
921,JACK (V.O.),921,"Sooner or later, we all became what
Tyler wanted us to be."
922,TYLER,922,"You have two black shirts?  Two pair
black trousers?  One pair black
boots?  Two pair black socks?  One
black coat?  Three hundred dollars
personal burial money?  Go inside."
923,TYLER,923,"You're too old.  Sorry.  And, you're
too fat.  Nice seeing you."
924,JACK,924,"Bob... Bob, wait..."
925,JACK,925,Let me explain this to you...
926,TYLER,926,"A monkey, ready to be shot into
space.  A Space Monkey, ready to
sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem."
927,RICKY,927,"You're too fucking old, fatty!  We
don't want your kind here!"
928,RICKY,928,"You're too short.  Go away, stumpy!
Go back to the circus!"
929,JACK (V.O.),929,So it went...
930,JACK (V.O.),930,Tyler built his army.
931,JACK (V.O.),931,"To what purpose, might one ask?
Well, one might ask, if not for the
first rule of Project Mayhem."
932,JACK (V.O.),932,In Tyler We Trust.
933,JACK (V.O.),933,"And, then..."
934,JACK,934,Tyler...
935,JACK (V.O.),935,He was gone.
936,FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY,936,"""You are not a beautiful and unique
snowflake.  You are the same decaying
organic matter as everything else.
We are all part of the same compost
heap."""
937,JACK (V.O.),937,Planet Tyler.
938,FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY,938,"""We are the all-singing, all-dancing
crap of the world."""
939,JACK (V.O.),939,"I had to hug the walls, trapped
inside this clockwork of Space
Monkeys, cooking and working and
sleeping in teams."
940,JACK (V.O.),940,"The house became a living thing, wet
inside from so many people sweating
and breathing.  So many people
moving, the house moved."
941,ANGEL FACE,941,That wouldn't interest you.
942,JACK,942,Where's Tyler?
943,ANGEL FACE,943,The first rule of Project --
944,JACK,944,"Right, right."
945,JACK (V.O.),945,"I'm all alone.  I Am Jack's Broken
Heart."
946,JACK,946,Get away from me!
947,MARLA'S VOICE (O.S.),947,Who are all these people?
948,JACK,948,The Paper Street Soap Company.
949,MARLA,949,Can I come in?
950,JACK,950,He's not here.
951,MARLA,951,What?
952,JACK,952,"He's not here!  Tyler's not here
anymore!  He's gone away!"
953,JACK,953,What's going on?
954,JACK,954,"Bob... oh, Christ..."
955,JACK,955,What... what happened... ?
956,MECHANIC,956,We were on assignment...
957,MECHANIC (V.O.),957,"We were supposed to kill two birds
with one stone:"
958,MECHANIC (V.O.),958,A piece of corporate art...
959,MECHANIC (V.O.),959,... and trash a trendy coffee bar.
960,MECHANIC (V.O.),960,"We had it all worked out, man.  It
went smooth... until..."
961,HARSH VOICE,961,Police!  Freeze!
962,MECHANIC,962,"They shot Bob... they shot him in the
head.  Those fuckers..."
963,ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY,963,We gotta do something.
964,RICKY,964,"We got to get rid of the evidence.
We have to get rid of this body."
965,ANGEL FACE,965,Bury him...
966,JACK,966,What... ?
967,ANGEL FACE,967,"The garden.  Take him there.  Move,
people.  Let's do this!"
968,JACK,968,No... !
969,JACK,969,"Get your hands off him!  Get off...!
What the hell do you think you're
doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a
man... !  You killed him!"
970,ANGEL FACE,970,He was killed in action.
971,JACK,971,"No!  Look at you!  You're... you're
running around in ski masks,
exploding things..."
972,ANGEL FACE,972,He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
973,RICKY,973,"It's what he would have wanted, sir."
974,JACK,974,"What he wanted?  Look... look at him.
Look at him!  What does he want?"
975,JACK,975,"This is a person.  This is not a cog
in your machine..."
976,RICKY,976,"But, this is Project Mayhem."
977,JACK,977,"No, no.  This is a man -- this man
has a name..."
978,RICKY,978,"But, in Project Mayhem, we have no
names."
979,JACK,979,"No!  Wrong!  This man's name is
Robert Paulson."
980,RICKY,980,Robert Paulson?
981,JACK,981,"Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead,
because of you..."
982,MECHANIC,982,I understand.
983,MECHANIC,983,"In death, a member of Project Mayhem
has a name."
984,JACK,984,No -- !
985,MECHANIC,985,His name is Robert Paulson.
986,RICKY,986,His name is Robert Paulson!
987,JACK,987,No!
988,ALL SPACE MONKEYS,988,His name is Robert Paulson!
989,JACK,989,Stop that -- !
990,ALL SPACE MONKEYS,990,"His name is Robert Paulson!  His name
is Robert Paulson..."
991,JACK,991,Tyler?
992,DETECTIVE STERN'S VOICE,992,"This is Detective Stern of the arson
unit.  I'd like to see you in my
office tomorrow morning..."
993,JACK (V.O.),993,"I went to the cities on Tyler's used
tickets stubs."
994,JACK (V.O.),994,"In every city, I branched out from
the airport to downtown, bar-
hopping..."
995,JACK (V.0.),995,"I didn't know how or why, but I could
look at fifty different bars, and
somehow I just knew..."
996,JACK,996,"Here.  Let me out, right here..."
997,JACK,997,I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
998,BARTENDER,998,Never heard of him.
999,JACK,999,"This is an emergency.  It's important
I find him."
1000,BARTENDER,1000,I wish I could help you... sir.
1001,JACK (V.O.),1001,Every city I went to...
1002,JACK (V.0.),1002,"...as soon as I set foot off the
plane..."
1003,JACK (V.).),1003,...I knew fight club was close.
1004,JACK (V.O.),1004,"Tyler was setting up franchises, all
over the country."
1005,JACK,1005,"I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't
you help me?"
1006,BANDAGED PROPRIETOR,1006,"Sir, you're disturbing the other
patrons with your laudish behavior."
1007,JACK,1007,There's no one else here.
1008,BANDAGED PROPRIETOR,1008,"I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest
idea what you're talking about."
1009,JACK,1009,"Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I
just need to know if you've seen
Tyler Durden."
1010,BANDAGED PROPRIETOR,1010,"I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such
information to you, nor would I, even
if I had said information you want,
at this juncture be able."
1011,JACK,1011,You are a moron.
1012,BANDAGED PROPRIETOR,1012,I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
1013,JACK (V.O.),1013,"Under and behind and inside
everything I took for granted,
something horrible had been growing."
1014,BRUISED PATRON #1,1014,"No one's ever seen him.  No one knows
what he looks like."
1015,BRUISED PATRON #2,1015,"He has facial reconstructive surgery
every three years."
1016,JACK,1016,"That's the stupidest thing I've ever
heard."
1017,BRUISED PATRON #1,1017,Is it true about fight club in Miami?
1018,BRUISED PATRON 12,1018,Is Mr. Durden building an army?
1019,JACK (V.O.),1019,Am I asleep... ?
1020,JACK (V.O.),1020,"Have I slept?  I'm not sure if Tyler
is my bad dream or if I'm Tyler's."
1021,JACK (V.O.),1021,"I was living in a state of perpetual
deja vu."
1022,JACK (V.O.),1022,"Everywhere I went, I felt I had
already been there."
1023,KITCHEN WORKERS,1023,"His name is Robert Paulson.  His name
is Robert Paulson..."
1024,MAN'S VOICE (O.S.),1024,"Welcome back, sir."
1025,WOUNDED BARTENDER,1025,How have you been?
1026,JACK,1026,... You know me?
1027,WOUNDED BARTENDER,1027,"Is this a test, sir?"
1028,JACK,1028,Yes... it's a test.
1029,WOUNDED BARTENDER,1029,You were in here last Thursday night.
1030,JACK,1030,What?
1031,WOUNDED BARTENDER,1031,"You were standing right where you are
now, asking how good our security is.
It's tight as a drum."
1032,JACK,1032,Who do you think I am?
1033,WOUNDED BARTENDER,1033,Is this part of the test?
1034,WOUNDED BARTENDER,1034,"You're the one who did this to me.
You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden."
1035,JACK (V.O.),1035,"Please return your seatbacks to their
full upright and locked position."
1036,MARLA,1036,Yeah?
1037,JACK,1037,"Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we
ever had sex?"
1038,MARLA,1038,"What kind of stupid question is
that?!"
1039,JACK,1039,"Because the answer's ""yes"" or because
the answer's ""no?"""
1040,MARLA,1040,Is this a trick?
1041,JACK,1041,"Will you just answer me, for
Christsake?!"
1042,MARLA,1042,"You mean, you want to know if I think
we were just having sex or making
love?"
1043,JACK,1043,We did make love?
1044,MARLA,1044,Is that what you're calling it?
1045,JACK,1045,Answer the question!
1046,MARLA,1046,"You fuck me, then snub me.  You love
me, you hate me.  You show me your
sensitive side, then you turn into a
total asshole!  Is that a pretty
accurate description of our
relationship, Tyler?"
1047,JACK (V.O.),1047,We've just lost cabin pressure.
1048,JACK,1048,What did you say... ?
1049,MARLA,1049,What is wrong with you?
1050,JACK,1050,Say my name.
1051,MARLA,1051,What... ?
1052,JACK,1052,Say my name!  What's my name!?
1053,MARLA,1053,"Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you
fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm
coming over there..."
1054,JACK,1054,"Marla, no, wait..."
1055,TYLER'S VOICE,1055,"We've got six fight clubs in Chicago
now..."
1056,TYLER,1056,Four in Milwaukee.
1057,JACK,1057,"What's this all about, Tyler?"
1058,TYLER,1058,"And, we're definitely filling a void
in the rural South."
1059,JACK,1059,Why do people think I'm you?
1060,TYLER,1060,"You broke your promise.  You talked
to her about me."
1061,JACK,1061,Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
1062,TYLER,1062,Why did you do that?
1063,JACK,1063,"Answer me, Tyler."
1064,TYLER,1064,Why do people think anything?
1065,JACK,1065,I don't know!  Tell me!
1066,TYLER,1066,"People think that you're me, because
you and I happen to share the same
body."
1067,JACK,1067,What... ?
1068,TYLER,1068,Is this really news to you?
1069,JACK,1069,What are you talking about... ?
1070,TYLER,1070,"Sometimes I control it, and you
imagine yourself watching me..."
1071,JACK,1071,"The first rule of fight club is --
you don't talk about fight club."
1072,TYLER,1072,"And, sometimes you control it..."
1073,JACK,1073,"He's not here!  Tyler's not here
anymore!  He's gone away!"
1074,TYLER,1074,"You can see me and hear me, but no
one else can..."
1075,JACK,1075,Anyone?
1076,JACK,1076,"My boss, probably."
1077,JACK,1077,Who would you fight?
1078,JACK,1078,"Oh, yeah."
1079,JACK,1079,I didn't really know my Dad...
1080,TYLER,1080,"But, when you fall asleep, I do
things without you..."
1081,TYLER,1081,"I go places without you.  Get things
done..."
1082,JACK,1082,"You are not your job.  You are not
how much money you have in the bank."
1083,BRUISED MAN #1,1083,I am not my job!
1084,BRUISED MAN #2,1084,"I am not how much money I have in the
bank!"
1085,TYLER,1085,"There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing
from you... one simple promise.  Now
look what you've done!"
1086,JACK,1086,This isn't possible...
1087,TYLER,1087,"We're going to have to do something
about Marla..."
1088,JACK,1088,What... what are you saying?
1089,TYLER,1089,"It's okay.  We okay... a little
codependent, sure, but..."
1090,JACK,1090,"No!  This isn't true.  We... we were
around other people, together, both
of us..."
1091,TYLER,1091,"You never talked to me in front of
anyone else."
1092,JACK,1092,"Wrong, wrong -- what about the car
crash... the two guys in the backseat?"
1093,TYLER,1093,What about them?  They're lunatics.
1094,JACK,1094,You took me to the house.
1095,TYLER,1095,The house is rented in your name.
1096,JACK,1096,You have jobs.
1097,TYLER,1097,Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
1098,JACK,1098,What about Marla?
1099,TYLER,1099,What about Marla?
1100,JACK,1100,She's... you... you're fucking her.
1101,TYLER,1101,"Um, well... technically, no."
1102,JACK (V.O.),1102,"It's called a ""changeover.""  The
movie goes on, and nobody in the
audience has any idea."
1103,DESK CLERK,1103,Sir... sir?  Are you checking out?
1104,JACK,1104,Yes.
1105,DESK CLERK,1105,"Please initial this list of phone
calls."
1106,JACK,1106,Bill me!
1107,JACK,1107,Wait...when were these made?
1108,DESK CLERK,1108,"It says right there, sir... between
two and three-thirty this morning."
1109,JACK,1109,I need a copy of this.
1110,JACK (V.O.),1110,"Had I been going to bed earlier every
night?  Have I been sleeping later?
Has Tyler been in charge longer and
longer?"
1111,JACK,1111,Wait here.
1112,JACK (V.O.),1112,"Deja vu, all over again..."
1113,VOICE,1113,Eighteen-eighty-eight.
1114,JACK,1114,Who is this?
1115,VOICE,1115,Maintenance.
1116,JACK,1116,"Listen, something is going to happen,
something terrible..."
1117,VOICE,1117,"Very good, Sir."
1118,JACK,1118,Excuse me?
1119,VOICE,1119,"Don't worry about us, sir.  We're
solid."
1120,JACK,1120,"Now wait, there's been a mix-up.
Everything's changed..."
1121,VOICE,1121,You told me you'd say that.
1122,JACK,1122,Abort the plan.
1123,VOICE,1123,"You told me you'd say that, too."
1124,JACK,1124,"Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist
dickhead?!"
1125,VOICE,1125,"Well, sir, you said you might."
1126,DIFFERENT VOICE,1126,Twenty-one-sixty.  Maintenance.
1127,JACK,1127,Marla!
1128,JACK,1128,Marla...
1129,MARLA,1129,"Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me
with a fucking broom.  I thought they
were going to break my arm."
1130,JACK,1130,"I'm sorry, I..."
1131,MARLA,1131,"The were burning their fingertips
with lye.  The stink was unbelievable."
1132,JACK,1132,"Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's
going to take a tremendous act of
faith on your part for you to hear me
out."
1133,MARLA,1133,Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
1134,JACK,1134,-- A little more faith than that.
1135,MARLA,1135,"I don't want to hear anything you've
got to say."
1136,JACK,1136,"Give me a minute, Marla, alright...
just sixty seconds."
1137,MARLA,1137,"Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here."
1138,JACK,1138,"Absolutely, you have every right.  I
need you to do me a favor."
1139,MARLA,1139,I've done you enough favors.
1140,WAITER,1140,"Sir!  Anything you order is free of
charge, sir."
1141,MARLA,1141,Why is it free of charge?
1142,JACK,1142,Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
1143,MARLA,1143,"Then, I'll have the clam chowder...
fried chicken and a baked potato with
everything and a chocolate chiffon
pie."
1144,JACK,1144,"Clean food, please."
1145,WAITER,1145,"In that case, sir, may I advise
against the lady eating the clam
chowder?"
1146,JACK,1146,"Thanks, no clam chowder.  That's it."
1147,MARLA,1147,You got about thirty seconds.
1148,JACK,1148,"I know that I've been... unwell.  I
know it's been like there's two sides
to me."
1149,MARLA,1149,"Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr.
Jackass."
1150,JACK,1150,"I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've
only just realized"
1151,MARLA,1151,What?
1152,JACK,1152,"I mean, the depth and breadth of our
relationship has only recently been
illuminated for me.  I know this...
I know us hasn't been such a great
thing for you..."
1153,MARLA,1153,Whatever.
1154,MARLA,1154,I'll take my food to go...
1155,JACK,1155,"Sit down!  Sit down and give me my
last fifteen seconds without opening
your mouth!"
1156,JACK,1156,"I'm trying to tell you -- and this is
where you have to trust me -- but, I
think your life might be in real
danger."
1157,MARLA,1157,What?
1158,JACK,1158,"You have to get out of here.  Leave
as soon as possible.  Go to any rural
town, away from any major city..."
1159,MARLA,1159,You are an insane person.
1160,JACK,1160,Marla...
1161,MARLA,1161,"No, no, shut up!  I've had enough.
I tried, Tyler... I have tried..."
1162,MARLA,1162,"There's a part of you I really like,
but I can't do this anymore.  I just
can't.  This is killing me..."
1163,JACK,1163,"I'm sorry, but I..."
1164,MARLA,1164,"What?!  You're sorry?  I don't
believe that for a minute."
1165,JACK,1165,"I can't explain.  You wouldn't
believe me anyway.  I'm trying to
protect you..."
1166,MARLA,1166,Let go of me!
1167,JACK,1167,"Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for
me, if you never do anything else..."
1168,MARLA,1168,"Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to
see you again!"
1169,JACK,1169,"Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll
never have to see me again."
1170,JACK,1170,Here... here...
1171,JACK,1171,"Take this money, get on this bus..."
1172,JACK,1172,"Get on, and I promise you, I'll never
bother you again, if that's what you
want.  Please..."
1173,MARLA,1173,Tyler...
1174,JACK,1174,"I'm begging you.  Get on the bus.
Get on the bus."
1175,MARLA,1175,Why are you doing this?
1176,JACK,1176,"I can't let myself see where you're
going.  Go wherever it takes you,
remember... keep away from major
cities..."
1177,MARLA,1177,"I'm not paying this back.  I consider
it ""asshole tax."""
1178,JACK,1178,"Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away
a couple of weeks, at least."
1179,MARLA,1179,Tyler...
1180,MARLA,1180,"You are the worst thing that ever
happened to me."
1181,JACK,1181,Son of a bitch!
1182,JACK,1182,"I want you to arrest me.  I'm the
leader of a terrorist organization
responsible for acts of vandalism all
over the city.  Detective Stern in
arson knows who I am..."
1183,JACK,1183,"There are probably several hundred
members in the metropolitan area.
Chapters are sprouting in at least
five other major cities.  They're
tightly-regimented, with many cells
capable of operating without a
central leader.  Check this address:
1537 Paper Street.  You'll find the
body of Robert Paulson buried in the
garden.  You'll also find numerous
tubs used to make gallons of
nitroglycerin.  The plan, I believe,
is to blow up these credit card
headquarters and the TRW building."
1184,STERN,1184,Why these buildings?
1185,JACK,1185,"You are not your job.  You are not
how much money you have in the bank."
1186,STERN,1186,Keep him talking.
1187,FLAT-TOP DETECTIVE,1187,"I really admire what you're doing.
You're a brave man to order this."
1188,JACK,1188,What?
1189,REDHEAD DETECTIVE,1189,"You're a genius, sir."
1190,BALD DETECTIVE,1190,"You know the drill.  You said if
anyone ever tries to interfere with
Project Mayhem, even you, we got to
get his balls."
1191,FLAT-TOP,1191,It's useless to fight.
1192,REDHEAD,1192,"This is really a powerful gesture,
Mr. Durden.  It'll set quite an
example."
1193,JACK,1193,No... you're making a mistake!
1194,FLAT-TOP,1194,You told us you'd say that.
1195,JACK,1195,I'm not Tyler Durden!
1196,BALDY,1196,"You told us you'd say that, too."
1197,JACK,1197,"Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm
ordering you to abort the mission!"
1198,FLAT-TOP,1198,"You said you would definitely say
that."
1199,BALDY,1199,"What's our best time for a ""cut and
run?"""
1200,FLAT-TOP,1200,Four minutes.
1201,BALDY,1201,Is somebody timing this?
1202,REDHEAD,1202,"Wait till the second hand gets to the
twelve."
1203,STERN,1203,"Some of this info checks out.  Let's
go to the place on Paper Street."
1204,REDHEAD,1204,"Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up
the time!"
1205,TYLER,1205,Could be worse...
1206,TYLER,1206,"You could be standing under 37
stories of steel and concrete with a
150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped
to the support... oh, maybe it
couldn't be..."
1207,JACK,1207,"You... you can't be serious about
this."
1208,TYLER,1208,What a ridiculous thing to say.
1209,JACK,1209,I can't let you...
1210,TYLER,1210,What are you going to do?
1211,JACK,1211,I'm going to...
1212,TYLER,1212,...stop me?
1213,JACK,1213,I'm not going...
1214,TYLER,1214,...to let this happen!
1215,JACK,1215,Stop finishing...
1216,TYLER,1216,"...your sentences!  They're
our sentences.  Get your mind around
that."
1217,TYLER,1217,"What are you doing running through
the streets in your underpants?  We
both use that body."
1218,JACK,1218,"Since when is Project Mayhem about
murder?"
1219,TYLER,1219,"The buildings were evacuated thirty
minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding
exactly as planned."
1220,JACK,1220,"You don't know that.  There could
still be people inside."
1221,TYLER,1221,"Maybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with
shaved heads couldn't synchronize
their watches.  Good riddance."
1222,TYLER,1222,"I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you
know which wires, in what order..."
1223,JACK,1223,"If you know, I know."
1224,TYLER,1224,"Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I
spent the whole day thinking about
the wrong ones."
1225,JACK,1225,"If I'm wrong, we're both dead.."
1226,TYLER,1226,This is not about martyrdom.
1227,JACK,1227,I'm pulling the green wire.
1228,TYLER,1228,Green?  Did you say green?
1229,JACK,1229,Yes...
1230,TYLER,1230,"Don't pull the green wire.  Pull
anything but the green wire."
1231,JACK,1231,Fuck you.
1232,TYLER,1232,I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
1233,TYLER,1233,"Hear that?  Marla's here.  Just in
the nick of time, eh?"
1234,TYLER,1234,See for yourself.
1235,MARLA,1235,You motherfuckers...
1236,TYLER,1236,"I've got everything.  The bombs.  The
army.  I've got Marla."
1237,JACK,1237,"Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew
a hole in his head.  Was that part of
your plan?"
1238,TYLER,1238,"Bob was a grown man.  In any great
struggle, there will be casualties.
Wouldn't that be implicit in the
name?  Project ""Mayhem."""
1239,JACK,1239,Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
1240,TYLER,1240,You want out?
1241,JACK,1241,I quit.
1242,TYLER,1242,"Not an option, for the most obvious
of reasons.  You need to get with the
program."
1243,TYLER,1243,Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
1244,JACK,1244,Tyler...
1245,TYLER,1245,What?
1246,JACK,1246,Defuse the bomb.
1247,TYLER,1247,Ask me nicely.
1248,JACK,1248,"Defuse the bomb, please."
1249,TYLER,1249,Defuse the bomb?
1250,JACK,1250,Yes.
1251,JACK,1251,Please.
1252,TYLER,1252,"I did that for you.  As a gesture.
Now, how fast can you run?  There are
ten other bombs, in ten other
buildings in the immediate area.  If
you're going to get them all, you
better get cracking."
1253,TYLER,1253,"Six minutes.  Green wires, remember.
I'll be upstairs."
1254,TYLER,1254,Whoa!  What was that all about?
1255,TYLER,1255,Fire at will.
1256,TYLER,1256,What did you expect?
1257,TYLER,1257,One minute.
1258,JACK (V.O.),1258,"I think this is about where we came
in."
1259,TYLER,1259,"This is the beginning.  We're at
ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
few words, to mark the occasion."
1260,JACK,1260,i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
1261,JACK,1261,I still can't think of anything.
1262,TYLER,1262,It's getting exciting now.
1263,TYLER,1263,Look what we've accomplished.
1264,TYLER,1264,Thirty seconds.
1265,TYLER,1265,"Out these windows, we will view the
economic collapse.  One step closer
to global equilibrium.  I'm glad
you're here with me."
1266,JACK,1266,Can't you call it off... ?
1267,TYLER,1267,It's out of our hands.
1268,TYLER,1268,This is it.
1269,JACK,1269,Please...
1270,TYLER,1270,"Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see
alright?  10... 9... 8...."
1271,TYLER,1271,5... 4... 3... 2...
1272,TYLER,1272,What the fuck -- ?
1273,JACK,1273,Paraffin.
1274,TYLER,1274,What?
1275,JACK,1275,"Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the
nitro with paraffin.  I saw it
floating in the bomb."
1276,"(more)
JACK (cont)",1276,"They must've run out of cotton and
Epsom salt.  Paraffin is iffy at best."
1277,TYLER,1277,Damn it!  God-damn it...
1278,JACK,1278,Not exactly according to plan.
1279,TYLER,1279,"Do we have to do everything
ourselves?!"
1280,TYLER,1280,"... Codename Rooster.  Passcode First
Strike..."
1281,JACK,1281,NO...
1282,TYLER,1282,Proceed with remote detonation.
1283,TYLER,1283,Haven't we already done this?
1284,JACK,1284,"How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking
figment of my imagination... you're
psychogenic fugue state..."
1285,TYLER,1285,"Fuck that, maybe you're my
hallucination."
1286,JACK,1286,Oh... Christ...
1287,JACK,1287,Why... why... why... ?
1288,TYLER,1288,Why what?
1289,JACK,1289,"Why can't I get rid of you?  Why
can't I just wish you away?"
1290,TYLER,1290,You need me.
1291,JACK,1291,"No, no, I don't."
1292,JACK,1292,"I thank you, I really do.  Thank you,
but I don't need you anymore."
1293,TYLER,1293,"Look, I can be selfish, I know that."
1294,TYLER,1294,I'm not blind to my own failings...
1295,JACK,1295,"Noooo, please..."
1296,TYLER,1296,"From now on, we'll share Marla.
We've been spending too much time
apart..."
1297,JACK,1297,"... no, no, no..."
1298,TYLER,1298,"No more running off without you.
From here on out, we do it together."
1299,JACK,1299,Why are you doing this?!
1300,TYLER,1300,I'm doing this for us.
1301,JACK,1301,"Please understand... I've gotten all
I can from this, Tyler."
1302,TYLER,1302,"If I leave, you will be right back
where I found you..."
1303,JACK,1303,"I swear on my life, I won't..."
1304,TYLER,1304,You will.  You know you will.
1305,TYLER,1305,Can you live with that?
1306,TYLER,1306,What are you doing?
1307,JACK,1307,What have you left for me?
1308,TYLER,1308,"Why do you want to do that? Why do
you want to put that gun in your
mouth?"
1309,JACK,1309,Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
1310,TYLER,1310,This is interesting.
1311,TYLER,1311,"Why are you going with this, Ikea-
boy?"
1312,JACK,1312,It's the only way to get rid of you...
1313,TYLER,1313,"I can see you feel very strongly.  I
feel strongly too."
1314,TYLER,1314,"Hey, you and me."
1315,TYLER,1315,Friends again?
1316,JACK,1316,Do something for me.
1317,TYLER,1317,What?
1318,JACK,1318,Appreciate something.
1319,TYLER,1319,What?
1320,JACK,1320,Look at me...
1321,TYLER,1321,What?
1322,JACK,1322,My eyes are open.
1323,TYLER,1323,What's that smell... ?
1324,TALL SPACE MONKEY,1324,"Are you all right, sir... ?!"
1325,JACK,1325,I'm okay...
1326,SHORT SPACE MONKEY,1326,"Are you sure?  You look terrible,
sir!  What's happened?"
1327,JACK,1327,Everything's fine.
1328,ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY,1328,"Sir, you look really awful!  Do you
need medical assistance?"
1329,JACK,1329,"Bring the girl to me.  The rest of
you get out.  Now!"
1330,MARLA,1330,What happened... ?
1331,JACK,1331,Don't ask.
1332,JACK,1332,Get to the rendezvous point.  Move it!
1333,MARLA,1333,"My God, you're shot..."
1334,JACK,1334,Yes.
1335,MARLA,1335,Who did this to you?
1336,JACK,1336,"I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm
fine..."
1337,JACK,1337,"I'm sorry... you met me at a very
strange time in my life."
