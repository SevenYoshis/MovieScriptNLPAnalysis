0,ROB (V.O.),0,"What came first?  The music or the
misery?  People worry about kids
playing with guns and watching violent
videos, we're scared that some sort
of culture of violence is taking
them over..."
1,ROB (V.O.),1,"But nobody worries about kids
listening to thousands -- literally
thousands -- of songs about broken
hearts and rejection and pain and
misery and loss."
2,ROB,2,"Did I listen to pop music because I
was miserable, or was I miserable
because I listened to pop music?"
3,LAURA,3,I don't really know what I'm doing.
4,ROB,4,"You don't have to go this second.
You can stay until whenever."
5,LAURA,5,"We've done the hard part now.  I
might as well, you know..."
6,ROB,6,"Well stay for tonight, then."
7,ROB,7,"My desert-island, all-time, top five
most memorable break-ups, in
chronological order are as follows:
Alison Ashworth, Penny Hardwick,
Jackie Allen, Charlie Nicholson,
Sarah Kendrew."
8,ROB,8,"Those were the ones that really hurt.
Can you see your name in that list,
Laura?  Maybe you'd sneak into the
top ten, but there's no place for
you in the top five.  Sorry.  Those
places are reserved for the kind of
humiliations and heartbreaks that
you're just not capable of delivering."
9,ROB,9,"That probably sounds crueler than
it's meant to, but the fact is, we're
too old to take each other miserable.
Unhappiness used to mean something.
Now it's just a drag like a cold or
having no money."
10,ROB,10,"If you really wanted to mess me up,
you should have got to me earlier."
11,ROB (V.O.),11,"Which brings us to number one.  Alison
Ashworth."
12,ROB (V.O.),12,"My relationship with Alison Ashworth
lasted six hours."
13,ROB (V.O.),13,"The two hours after school and before
The Rockford Files, three days in a
row.  On the fourth afternoon."
14,ROB (V.O.),14,Kevin Bannister.
15,ROB (V.O.),15,"It would be nice to think that since
I was fourteen, times have changed,
relationships have become more
sophisticated, females less cruel,
skins thicker, but there still seems
to be an element of that afternoon
in everything that has happened to
me since.  All my other romantic
stories seem to be a scrambled version
of that first one."
16,ROB,16,"Number two.  Penny Hardwick.  Penny
was great-looking, and her top five
recording artists were Carly Simon,
Carole King, James Taylor, Cat
Stevens, and Elton John..."
17,ROB (V.O.),17,"Everybody liked her.  She was nice.
Nice manners.  Nice grades.  Nice-
looking."
18,ROB (V.O.),18,"She was so nice, in fact, that she
wouldn't let me put my hand
underneath, or even on top of, her
bra."
19,ROB (V.O.),19,"Penny was nice, but I wasn't
interested in nice, just breasts,
and therefore she was no good to me.
And so I was finished with her."
20,ROB,20,"What's the point?  It never goes
anywhere."
21,ROB,21,"She cried, and I hated her for it,
because she made me feel bad.  I
started dating a girl who everybody
said would put out, and Penny went
with this asshole Chris Thompson who
told me that he had sex with her
after something like three dates.
How had Penny gone from a girl who
wouldn't do anything to a girl who
would do everything?"
22,ROB,22,"My store's right up here.  It's called
The Record Exchange.  It's carefully
placed to attract the bare minimum
of window shoppers."
23,ROB,23,"I get by because of the people who
make a special effort to shop here
on Saturday young men, always young
men, who spend a disproportionate
amount of their time looking for
deleted Smiths singles and ""original
not rereleased"" underline Frank Zappa
albums."
24,ROB,24,"The fetish properties are not unlike
porn.  I would feel guilty taking
their money if I wasn't, kind of,
well, one of them."
25,ROB,25,"'Morning, Dick."
26,DICK,26,"Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob."
27,ROB,27,Good weekend?
28,DICK,28,"Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice
Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The
one on Testament of Youth.  Never
released here.  Japanese import only."
29,ROB,29,Great.
30,DICK,30,I'll tape it for you.
31,ROB,31,"No, that's okay.  Really."
32,DICK,32,"'Cause you like their second one,
you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one
with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You
didn't see the cover though."
33,ROB,33,"Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that
one."
34,DICK,34,"Well, I'll just make it for you."
35,ROB,35,Okay.
36,ROB,36,What's this?
37,DICK,37,"The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like
it?"
38,BARRY,38,BAA!  BA BA DANG!
39,BARRY,39,Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
40,DICK,40,It's the new --
41,ROB,41,"It's the record we've been listening
to and enjoying, Barry."
42,BARRY,42,"Well that's problematic because it
sucks ass."
43,BARRY,43,"Yours, I assume..."
44,ROB,44,"TURN IT OFF, BARRY."
45,BARRY,45,IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
46,BARRY,46,What are you doing?
47,ROB,47,"I don't want to hear Public Enemy
right now."
48,BARRY,48,"Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do
is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on
some old sad bastard music see if I
care."
49,ROB,49,"I don't want old sad bastard music
either.  I just want something I can
ignore."
50,BARRY,50,"But it's my new tape.  My Monday
morning tape.  I made it last night
just for today."
51,ROB,51,"Yeah, well it's fucking Monday
afternoon.  You should get out of
bed earlier."
52,BARRY,52,Don't you want to hear what's next?
53,ROB,53,What's next?
54,BARRY,54,Play it.
55,ROB,55,Say it.
56,BARRY,56,"""Little Latin Lupe Lu."""
57,DICK,57,Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
58,BARRY,58,No.  The Righteous Brothers.
59,DICK,59,Oh well.  Nevermind.
60,BARRY,60,What?
61,DICK,61,Nothing.
62,BARRY,62,"No, not nothing.  What's wrong with
the Righteous Brothers?"
63,DICK,63,"Nothing.  I just prefer the other
one."
64,BARRY,64,Bullshit.
65,ROB,65,"How can it be bullshit to state a
preference?"
66,BARRY,66,"Since when did this shop become a
fascist regime?"
67,ROB,67,"Since you brought that bullshit tape
in."
68,BARRY,68,"Great.  That's the fun of working in
a record store.  Playing crappy pap
you don't want to listen to.  I
thought this tape was going to be,
you know, a conversation stimulator.
I was going to ask you for your top
five records to play on a Monday
morning and all that, and you just
had to ruin it."
69,ROB,69,We'll do it next Monday.
70,BARRY,70,Well what's the point in that?
71,ROB,71,"Hey.  Didn't you steal that one
already?"
72,DICK,72,Can I help you?
73,JUSTIN,73,Just this.
74,DICK,74,That'll be fifteen-twenty-seven.
75,VINCE,75,Isn't your name Dick?
76,DICK,76,Yes.
77,VINCE,77,That sucks.  Get it?
78,ROB,78,"I'm sick of the sight of this place,
to be honest.  Some days I'm afraid --"
79,ROB,79,"I'm afraid I'll go berserk, rip the
Elvis Costello mobile from the
ceiling, throw the ""Country Artists
Male A-K"" rack out onto the streets,
go off to work in a Virgin Megastore
and never come back --"
80,CUSTOMER (O.S.),80,"I'm looking for a record for my
daughter.  For her birthday.  ""I
Just Called To Say I Love You."" Do
you have it?"
81,BARRY (O.S.),81,Oh yeah.  We got it.
82,CUSTOMER (O.S.),82,Great.  Can I have it then?
83,BARRY (O.S.),83,"No, you can't."
84,CUSTOMER,84,Why not?
85,BARRY,85,"Because it's sentimental tacky crap,
that's why not.  Do we look like the
kind of store that sells ""I Just
Called To Say I Loved You?"" Go to
the mall and stop wasting our time."
86,CUSTOMER,86,"What's your problem?  What did I...
Why are you --"
87,BARRY,87,"Do you even know your daughter?
There is no way she likes that song.
Or is she in a coma?"
88,CUSTOMER,88,"Okay, okay, buddy.  I didn't know it
was Pick On the Middle-Aged Square
Guy Day.  My apologies.  I'll be on
my way."
89,BARRY,89,B'Bye!
90,CUSTOMER,90,FUCK YOU!
91,ROB,91,"Nice, Barry."
92,BARRY,92,"Rob.  Top five musical crimes
perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the
'80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is
it in fact unfair to criticize a
formerly great artist for his latter-
day sins?  ""Is it better to burn out
than to fade away?"""
93,ROB,93,"You just drove a fucking customer
away, Barry."
94,BARRY,94,"We didn't even really have it.  I
happen to know for a fact that the
only Stevie Wonder single we have is
""Don't Drive Drunk."" I was just
goofing on the straight, and it never
cost you a penny."
95,ROB,95,Not the point.
96,BARRY,96,"Oh, so what's the point then?"
97,ROB,97,"I don't want you talking to our
customers like that again."
98,BARRY,98,"""Our customers?"" You think that Mr.
L.L. Bean out there is going to be a
regular?"
99,ROB,99,"Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we
used to fuck with anyone who asked
for anything we didn't like, but
it's gotta stop."
100,BARRY,100,"Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy
one record -- which we didn't even
have -- and leave and never come
back again anyway.  Why not have a
little fun?  Big fucking deal."
101,ROB,101,What did he ever do to you?
102,BARRY,102,"He offended me with his terrible
taste."
103,ROB,103,"It wasn't even his terrible taste.
It was his daughter's."
104,BARRY,104,"Oh, now you're defending that
motherfucker?  You're going soft in
your old age, Rob.  There was a time
when you would have chased him out
of the store and up the street.  Now
all of a sudden I'm offending your
golf buddy."
105,BARRY,105,"You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry.
How are we ever going to make enough
money to get you and Laura into the
country club?"
106,BARRY,106,"And by the way, I tell you this for
your own good: That's the worst
sweater I've ever seen.  I have never
seen a sweater that bad worn by anyone
I'm on speaking terms with.  It's a
disgrace to the human race."
107,DICK,107,"Hey, guys... Hey."
108,BARRY,108,"What are you, some kind of fucking
maniac?  If this jacket's torn you're
gonna pay big."
109,DICK,109,Are you all right?
110,ROB,110,"Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura
and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if
we ever see Barry again maybe you
can tell him that."
111,DICK,111,"'Course I will, Rob.  No problem.
No problem at all.  I'll tell him
next time I see him."
112,DICK,112,"I've ah... got some other stuff to
tell him anyway, so it's no problem.
I'll just tell him about, you know,
Laura, when I tell him the other
stuff."
113,ROB,113,Fine.
114,DICK,114,"I'll start with your news before I
tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't
much, really, just about Marie LaSalle"
115,DICK,115,"playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I
like her, you know, she's kind of
Sheryl Crowish... but, you know,
good.  So I'll tell him before that.
Good news and bad news kind of thing."
116,DICK,116,"Or rather, bad news and good news,
because he likes this person playing
tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura
too, I didn't mean that.  And he
likes you.  It's just that --"
117,ROB,117,"I understand, Dick."
118,DICK,118,"Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you
want to... talk about it, that kind
of thing?"
119,ROB,119,"No.  Thanks though, Dick."
120,ROB,120,"Number three in the top five break-
ups was Charlie Nicholson, sophomore
year of college.  Some people never
got over 'Nam, or the night their
band opened for Nirvana.  I guess I
never really got over Charlie."
121,ROB (V.O.),121,"She looked different.  Dramatic.
Exotic.  She talked a lot, about
remarkably interesting things like
music, books, film, and politics..."
122,ROB (V.O.),122,"...so we didn't have those terrible,
strained sentences, that seemed to
characterized most of my
relationships.  And she liked me.
She liked me.  She liked me."
123,ROB (V.O.),123,"We went out for two years, and for
every single minute I felt as though
I was standing on a dangerously narrow
ledge.  I couldn't get comfortable,
couldn't ever stretch out and relax.
Why would a girl -- no, a woman --
like Charlie go out with someone who
only a few years ago sewed a Foghat
patch on his jacket?  I felt like
all those people who suddenly shaved
their heads and said they'd always
been punks.  I felt like a fraud.
And I was depressed by the lack of
flamboyance in my wardrobe..."
124,ROB (V.O.),124,"...I worried about my abilities as a
lover.  I was intimidated by the
other men in her design department,
and became convinced that she was
going to leave me for one of them."
125,ROB (V.O.),125,"She left me for one of them.  The
dreaded Marco."
126,ROB (V.O.),126,"And I lost it.  I lost it all.
Dignity, faith, fifteen pounds..."
127,ROB (V.O.),127,"Any small idea of personal identity
that I had acquired up to that point."
128,ROB (V.O.),128,"I came to three months later, and to
my surprise had flunked out of school
and started working in a record store."
129,ROB,129,"What I really learned from the Charlie
Debacle is that you gotta punch your
weight.  Charlie was out of my Class:
too pretty, too smart, too witty,
too much.  What am I?  Average.  A
middleweight.  Not the smartest guy
in the world, but certainly not the
dumbest.  I've read books like The
Unbearable Lightness of Being,
Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time
of Cholera, and understood them, I
think -- they're about girls, right? --
just kidding -- but I don't like
them very much.  My all time top
five favorite books are Johnny Cash's
autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil
Stevenson, Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser
Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't
know, probably something by Kurt
Vonnegut.  I look through the New
Yorker when my neighbor's done with
it, and I'm not averse to going down
to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles
films, although on the whole I prefer
American films.  Top five being Blade
Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first
two Godfathers which we'll count as
one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining.
I'm okay looking, average height,
not skinny, not fat.  My genius, if
I can call it that, is to combine a
whole load of averageness into one
compact frame.  You might say there
were millions like me, but there
aren't, really: Alot of guys have
impeccable music taste but don't
read, alot of guys read but are really
fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to
women but have stupid beards, alot
of guys have a Woody Allen sense of
humor but look like Woody Allen.
Some drink too much, some drive like
assholes, some get into fights, or
show off money, or do drugs.  I don't
do any of these things, really.  If
I do okay with women it's not because
of the virtues I have, but because
of the ugly flaws I don't have...
So.  Charlie and I didn't match.
After her I was determined to never
get out of my league again."
130,JANET,130,"Hello, you two.  Laura, it's your
mother.  Your father's angina is a
little rough today and I thought
he'd like to talk to you.  No big
deal.  I love you two.  Bye."
131,LIZ,131,"Rob, it's Liz.  Just calling to see,
well, if you're okay.  Give me a
ring.  I'm not taking sides.  Yet.
Lot's of love.  Bye."
132,ROB (V.O.),132,"Charlie and I didn't match.  Marco
and Charlie matched.  Me and Sarah,
number four on the all time break-
ups list, matched.  She wore more or
less the same clothes as mine, had
an acceptable working knowledge of
music, and she had been dumped by
some asshole named Michael.  He was
her moment, Charlie was mine.  Sarah
had sworn off men.  I had sworn off
women.  It made sense to pool our
loathing of the opposite sex, swear
them off together, and get to share
a bed with someone at the same time."
133,ROB (V.O.),133,"We were frightened of being left
alone for the rest of our lives.
Only people of a certain disposition
are frightened of being alone for
the rest of their lives at twenty-
six.  We were of that disposition.
Everything seemed much later than it
was."
134,ROB (V.O.),134,"When she told me that she met someone
else it made no sense.  Her meeting
someone else was contrary to the
whole spirit of our arrangement.
All we really had in common was that
we were dumped by people, and that
we were against dumping.  We were
violently anti-dump.  So how come I
got dumped?"
135,ROB,135,"You run the risk of losing anyone
who is worth spending time with.
But I didn't know that at the time.
All I saw was that I'd moved down a
division and that it still hadn't
worked out, and this seemed cause
for a great deal of misery and self-
pity.  And that's when Laura came
along."
136,ROB,136,"I'm reorganizing my records tonight.
It's something I do in times of
emotional distress.  When Laura was
here I had them in alphabetical order,
before that, chronologically.
Tonight, though, I'm trying to put
them in the order in which I bought
them.  That way I can write my own
autobiography without picking up a
pen.  Pull them all off the shelves,
look for Revolver and go from there.
I'll be able to see how I got from
Deep Purple to The Soft Boys in twenty-
five moves.  What I really like about
my new system is that it makes me
more complicated than I am.  To find
anything you have to be me, or at
the very least a doctor in Rob-ology.
If you wanna find Landslide by
Fleetwood Mac you have to know that
I bought it for someone in the fall
of 1983 and then didn't give it to
them for personal reasons.  But you
don't know any of that, do you?  You
would have to ask me to--"
137,ROB,137,Yeah?
138,MOM,138,"Hi, Rob.  It's your mother."
139,ROB,139,"Hi, Mom."
140,MOM,140,Everything all right?
141,ROB,141,Great.  Super-fantastic.
142,MOM,142,How's the store?
143,ROB,143,So so.  Up and down.
144,MOM,144,"Your lucky Laura's doing so well.
If it wasn't for her, I don't think
either of us would ever sleep..."
145,ROB,145,She left.  She's gone.
146,MOM,146,What do you mean?  Where did she go?
147,ROB,147,"How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend.
Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura
move out."
148,MOM,148,Well call her mother.
149,ROB,149,"She just called.  She doesn't even
know.  It's probably the last time
I'll ever hear her voice.  That's
weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas
at somebody's house, you know, and
you worry about their operations and
you see them in their bathrobe, and...
I dunno..."
150,ROB,150,"There'll be another mom and another
Christmas.  Right?"
151,ROB,151,Hello?  Anybody there?
152,ROB,152,"I'm all right, if that's what's
upsetting you."
153,MOM,153,"You know that's not what's upsetting
me."
154,ROB,154,"Well it fucking should be, shouldn't
it?"
155,MOM,155,"I knew this would happen.  What are
you going to do Rob?"
156,ROB,156,"I'm going to drink this bottle of
wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then
tomorrow I'll get up and go to work."
157,MOM,157,And after that?
158,ROB,158,"Meet a nice girl and have children.
I promise the next time we talk I'll
have it all sorted out."
159,MOM,159,I knew this was going to happen.
160,ROB,160,"Then what are you getting so upset
about?"
161,MOM,161,"What did Laura say?  Do you know why
she left?"
162,ROB,162,"It's got nothing to do with marriage,
if that's what you're getting at."
163,MOM,163,"So you say.  I'd like to hear her
side of it."
164,ROB,164,"Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm
telling you Laura didn't want to get
married!  She is not that kind of
girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not
what happens now."
165,MOM,165,"Well I don't know what happens now,
apart from you meet someone, you
move in, she goes.  You meet someone,
you move in, she goes."
166,ROB,166,"Shut up, Mom."
167,ROB,167,"Peter.  Frampton.  That perm! ""Show
Me the Way""!  A phenomenon based on
a live album that was actually
recorded in a studio!  What is
happening?  I am getting misty, choked
up at a song that I had the good
sense at twelve to realize was so
saccharine and stupid as to be
inarticulatable, until Michael Bolton,
that is."
168,ROB,168,"Sentimental music makes you nostalgic
and hopeful at the same time.  Marie's
the hopeful part.  Laura's the
nostalgia part.  These things happen.
They happen to men, at any rate.
This is why I shouldn't be listening
to pop music."
169,DICK,169,ROB!
170,ROB,170,I always hated this song.
171,DICK,171,Yeah.
172,BARRY,172,Yeah.
173,ROB,173,But now I kind of like it.
174,DICK,174,"She shouldn't done it on ""The Number
Four With a Smile."""
175,BARRY,175,"Isn't her album called ""Number Four
With A Smile?"""
176,DICK,176,That's what I said.
177,BARRY,177,"No, no, no, you said ""The Number
Four With a Smile,"" and there's no
""The"" at the front of the title of
the album."
178,DICK,178,"It's a reference to a Chinese meal
in Toronto and I think that there is
a ""The.""  But I could be wrong."
179,BARRY,179,You can be and are wrong.
180,BARRY,180,I wanna date a musician...
181,ROB,181,"I wanna live with a musician.  She'd
write songs at home, ask me what she
thought of them, maybe even include
one of our private jokes in the liner
notes."
182,BARRY,182,"...Maybe a picture of me in the liner
notes..."
183,DICK,183,Just in the background somewhere.
184,MARIE,184,"Thanks, you guys, I know I'm not
supposed to like that song, but I
do.  I'm gonna take a break for a
second.  Anybody wants to buy one of
my tapes, they're five bucks up here.
One of my other personalities will
be selling them."
185,BARRY,185,Let's go get one.
186,ROB,186,Let's not.
187,DICK,187,I want a tape.
188,ROB,188,"I don't need to go up there right
now."
189,MARIE,189,Enjoying yourselves?
190,MARIE,190,Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
191,ROB,191,Good.
192,ROB,192,So you live in Chicago now?
193,MARIE,193,"Yup.  Not far from here, actually."
194,BARRY,194,You like it?
195,MARIE,195,"It's okay.  Hey.  You guys might be
the sort to know.  Are there any
good record stores around here or do
I have to go downtown?"
196,DICK,196,He's got one!
197,BARRY,197,On Clark Street!
198,DICK,198,A couple blocks!  About six!
199,BARRY,199,We work there!
200,DICK,200,You'd love it!
201,MARIE,201,What do you sell?
202,BARRY,202,"A little of anything that matters.
Rock, soul, R&B, punk rock, hip-
hop, ska, new wave..."
203,MARIE,203,Sounds great.
204,ROB,204,"What did you tell her about the shop
for?"
205,BARRY,205,"I didn't know it was classified
information.  I mean, I know we don't
have any customers, but I thought
that was a bad thing, not, like, a
business strategy."
206,BARRY (O.S.),206,ROB!  PHONE!
207,ROB,207,Rob here.
208,LIZ (O.S.),208,Hey.  It's Liz.
209,ROB,209,What's happenin'.
210,LIZ,210,You called this morning?
211,ROB,211,"Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you
for that message last night.  It
made me feel like... like less of an
asshole."
212,LIZ,212,How're you holding up?
213,ROB,213,"Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great.
Last night I got to thinking, ""you
know what?  Maybe it is time to move
on.  Maybe we're just not right for
each other.  Or maybe we are.  But
time will tell and at this point I'm
going to be fine with whatever's
meant to be."" You know?"
214,LIZ,214,"Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to
take sides.  And I like Laura with
you.  She's more fun, more open.
You guys are good together.  I just
wish you two could, I don't know.  I
don't think much of this Ian guy --"
215,DICK,215,Rob.
216,ROB,216,"Liz, hold on a second --"
217,ROB,217,What?
218,DICK,218,"Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here,
she's here, and now!"
219,ROB,219,"Liz, can you hold for a second?"
220,ROB,220,I'll be out there!  Go!
221,ROB,221,"Hey, Liz, I gotta go... Tomorrow
night?  Great.  Green Mill.  Fine.
Seven?  Done.  Thanks.  Right.  Bye."
222,ROB,222,Oh.  Hi.
223,MARIE,223,Don't you like that?
224,ROB,224,"No, no, I love, it's just, thinking
you're, you must be so sick of it...
Well."
225,ROB,225,WHAT FUCKING IAN GUY?!!
226,DICK,226,Rob --!
227,ROB,227,-- FUCK OFF!
228,BARRY,228,"We're only on the fucking list for
Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's
all!  All three of us."
229,ROB,229,"That's fucking great, Barry.  We can
spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save
five each.  Fantastic, Barry!"
230,BARRY,230,We can take your car.
231,ROB,231,"It's not my car, now is it?  It's
Laura's car, and thus Laura has it.
So it's an ass-bumping double-
transferring bus ride through
bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab.
Wow.  Fucking great."
232,BARRY,232,Jaggoff...
233,ROB,233,Who the fuck is Ian?!
234,ROB,234,"Laura doesn't know anybody called
Ian.  There's no Ian at her office.
She has no friends named Ian.  She
has never met anyone called Ian in
her whole life.  Although there may
have been one in college -- but I am
almost certain that since 1989 she
has lived in an Ian-less universe."
235,ROB,235,"""I. Raymond."" Ray. ""I."" IAN."
236,ROB,236,"Mr. I Raymond. ""Ray"" to his friends,
and, more importantly, to his
neighbors.  The guy who up until
about six weeks ago lived upstairs.
I knew it was him the moment I saw
the letter.  I start to remember
things now: His stupid clothing, his
music -- Latin, Bulgarian, whatever
fucking world music was trendy that
week--stupid laugh, awful cooking
smells.  I can't remember anything
good about him at all.  I never liked
him much then, and I fucking hate
him now... I manage to block out the
worst, most painful, most disturbing
memory of him until I go to bed."
237,ROB,237,Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
238,LAURA,238,I should be so lucky.
239,ROB,239,"You are as abandoned and as noisy as
any character in a porn film, Laura.
You are Ian's plaything, responding
to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic
delight.  No woman in the history of
the world is having better sex than
the sex you are having with Ian in
my head."
240,ROB,240,"Number five -- Jackie Allen.  My
break up with Jackie Allen had no
effect on my life whatsoever.  I
just slotted her in to bump you out
of position, Laura.  Yes, you do in
fact make it into the top five.
Welcome.  And just to remind you,
the list is in chronological order,
not in the order of pain and
suffering."
241,FEMALE VOICE,241,Hey.
242,GIRL,242,Do you have soul?
243,ROB,243,That all depends.
244,ROB,244,"Record Exchange... How many records...
Right, well if you could bring them --
okay, well, where do you live?
Right... how about now?  I can come
right over..."
245,ROB,245,Okay.
246,ROB,246,"Some lady's got some singles to sell.
I'll be back in a half-hour."
247,ROB,247,Hi.  You called about the records?
248,WOMAN,248,Those.
249,WOMAN,249,What do you think?
250,ROB,250,"It's the best collection I've ever
seen."
251,WOMAN,251,"Give me fifty bucks and they're all
yours."
252,ROB,252,"These are worth at least, I don't
know --"
253,WOMAN,253,"I know what they're worth.  Give me
fifty and get them out."
254,ROB,254,But you must have --
255,WOMAN,255,"I must have nothing.  Their my
husband's."
256,ROB,256,"And you must not be getting along
too well right now, huh?"
257,WOMAN,257,"He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three-
year-old.  A friend of my daughter's.
He had the fucking nerve to call me
and ask me to borrow some money and
I told him to fuck off, so he asked
me to sell his singles collection
and send him a check for whatever I
go, minus a ten percent commission.
Which reminds me.  Can you make sure
you give me a five?  I want to frame
it and put it on the wall."
258,ROB,258,"It must have taken him a long time
to get them together."
259,WOMAN,259,"Years.  This collection is as close
as he's ever come to an achievement."
260,ROB,260,"Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You
don't have to tell him what you got.
Send him forty-five bucks and blow
the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or
something."
261,WOMAN,261,"That wasn't part of the deal.  I
want to be poisonous but fair."
262,ROB,262,"Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't
want to be any part of this."
263,WOMAN,263,"Suit yourself.  There are plenty of
others who will."
264,ROB,264,"That's why I'm trying to compromise.
What about fifteen-hundred?  They're
worth five times that."
265,WOMAN,265,Sixty.
266,ROB,266,Thirteen hundred.
267,WOMAN,267,Seventy-five.
268,ROB,268,"Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest
offer."
269,WOMAN,269,And I won't take a penny over ninety.
270,WOMAN,270,"With eleven hundred he could come
home, and that's the last thing I
want."
271,ROB,271,"I'm sorry but I think you better
talk to someone else."
272,WOMAN,272,Fine.
273,ROB,273,"Can I buy this Otis Redding single
off you?"
274,WOMAN,274,Sure.  Ten cents.
275,ROB,275,"Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten
dollars for this, and you can give
the rest away for all I care."
276,WOMAN,276,"Okay.  Because you took the trouble
to come up here.  And because you've
got principles.  But that's it.  I'm
not selling them to you one by one."
277,ROB,277,"How come I end up siding with the
bad guy, the man who ran off to
Jamaica with some nymphette?  I just
got left for someone else, so why
can't I bring myself to feel whatever
it is his wife is feeling?  All I
can see is that guy's face when he
gets that pathetic check in the mail
for those records, and I can't help
but feel desperately, painfully sorry
for him."
278,LIZ,278,MOTHERFUCKER.
279,ROB,279,"What's the -- hey, Liz --"
280,LIZ,280,"-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked
to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and
she gave me a little background.
And you're a fucking ASSHOLE."
281,LIZ,281,"To think I sympathized with you for
two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left
him out of nowhere for the schmuck
upstairs.  You let me believe that!"
282,ROB,282,It's true!
283,LIZ,283,"Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura
pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat
on her!  You borrowed money from her
and never paid a dime back!  And
then, just a few weeks ago, you told
her you were unhappy with her and
were ""kind of looking around for
somebody else!"""
284,ROB,284,Well she --
285,ROB,285,"She's right, of course.  I am a
fucking asshole.  I did and said
those things.  But before you judge,
although you've probably already
done so, go off for a minute and
write down the top five worst things
that you have done to your partner,
even if -- especially if -- your
partner doesn't know about them.
Don't dress things up or try to
explain them.  Just write them down
in the plainest language possible..."
286,ROB,286,"Pencils down.  Okay, so who's the
asshole now?"
287,BARRY,287,"It's almost impossible to find,
especially on CD.  Yet another cruel
trick on all of the dumbasses who
got rid of their turntables.  But
every other Echo and the Bunnymen
album --"
288,CUSTOMER,288,I have all of the others.
289,BARRY,289,"Oh really.  Well what about the first
Jesus and Mary Chain?"
290,CUSTOMER,290,They always seemed...
291,BARRY,291,"They always seemed what?  They always
seemed really great, is what they
always seemed.  They picked up where
your precious Echo left off, and
you're sitting here complaining about
no more Echo albums.  I can't believe
that you don't own that record.
That's insane."
292,CUSTOMER,292,Well what about the new Echo --
293,BARRY,293,Do not get ahead of yourself.
294,DICK,294,"The interesting thing about Green
Day is that so much of their music
is in truth directly influenced by,
in my opinion, two bands."
295,FEMALE CUSTOMER,295,The Clash.
296,DICK,296,"Correct.  The Clash.  But also the
Stranglers."
297,FEMALE CUSTOMER,297,Who?
298,DICK,298,"I think you would love the
Stranglers..."
299,FEMALE CUSTOMER,299,This sounds great.
300,CUSTOMER,300,Is this the new Green Day?
301,BARRY,301,"That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone
you don't own fucking Blonde on
Blonde.  What about Television?"
302,CUSTOMER,302,I have a television.
303,BARRY,303,NO--!
304,ROB,304,"I will now sell four copies of Cats
and Dogs by the Royal Trux."
305,DICK,305,Do it.  Do it.
306,CUSTOMER,306,What is this?
307,ROB,307,It's the Royal Trux.
308,CUSTOMER,308,It's great.
309,ROB,309,I know.
310,ROB,310,"Dick, ring the man up..."
311,ROB,311,DICK!  THE DOOR!
312,ROB,312,"Okay, fuckos.  How much is this deck
worth to you, and how many CD's did
you rip off?  Can you do the math?"
313,ROB,313,"And what about you, dork?"
314,ROB,314,"Dick, call the police, please."
315,ROB,315,"Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik.
Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg.
Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett...
What's going on here?  Are you guys
stealing for other people now?"
316,VINCE,316,Naw.  Those are for us.
317,ROB,317,"Oh really.  You two are slamming to
Nico now?"
318,JUSTIN,318,"You're, like, so bigoted to look at
us and, like, think you know what we
listen to."
319,VINCE,319,"You got the CD's so can I have my
board back?"
320,ROB,320,I think you have more.
321,VINCE,321,Well we don't.
322,ROB,322,I can't frisk you but the cops can.
323,ROB,323,"Jesus.  That thing's been in the
bargain bin for six months!  Was it
just your criminal nature or what?
Hell, I would've given it to you for
free."
324,VINCE,324,"No, we..."
325,JUSTIN,325,"We don't know how it works.  Nobody
even knows, so we wanted to check it
out in that mag."
326,JUSTIN,326,"Like, do you know how to actually
make a CD?"
327,ROB,327,"Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple.
You make the tracks -- recording
studio -- deliver them to the pressing
plant where a master is cut, the
master is then dubbed to submasters,
which are the ""mothers,"" as their
called, for each press in the plant.
You press the CD's or records, put
in your cover art, and that's it."
328,VINCE,328,"Records are those big round black
things, right?"
329,ROB,329,Fuck off.
330,VINCE,330,"Hey, can I have my board?"
331,BARRY,331,What?
332,ROB,332,"What do you mean, ""what?"""
333,BARRY,333,What are you snickering about?
334,ROB,334,"I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling.
Because I'm happy."
335,BARRY,335,"What am I missing?  What do you have
to be happy about?"
336,DICK,336,Well we rang $900 today.
337,ROB,337,"Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy
because I'm proud of us.  Because
although our talents are small and
peculiar, we use them to their best
advantage."
338,ROB,338,Shit!
339,LAURA,339,Hi.
340,ROB,340,Hi.
341,LAURA,341,"I thought I could give you a lift
back."
342,ROB,342,Are you coming home?
343,LAURA,343,"Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your
house to get some things."
344,ROB,344,My house?
345,ROB,345,"First of all: The money.  The money
is easy to explain: She had it and I
didn't, and she wanted to give it to
me.  If she hadn't, I would have
gone under.  I've never paid her
back because I've never been able
to, and just because she's took off
and moved in with some Supertramp
fan doesn't make me five grand richer.
So that's the money --"
346,LAURA,346,"You can make all the faces you want.
My car.  My car stereo.  My
compilation tape."
347,ROB,347,"How can you like Art Garfunkel and
Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you
support the Israelis and the
Palestinians."
348,LAURA,348,"It's not like saying that at all,
actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and
Marvin Gaye make pop records --"
349,ROB,349,"-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead,
his father shot him in --"
350,LAURA,350,"-- whatever, and the Israelis and
the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel
and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a
bitter territorial dispute, and the
Israelis and the Palestinians are.
Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --"
351,ROB,351,"-- Alright, alright but --"
352,LAURA,352,"-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye,
anyway?"
353,ROB,353,"Hey!  Marvin Gaye! ""Got to Give It
Up!"" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye
is responsible for our entire
relationship!"
354,LAURA,354,"Is that right?  I'd like a word with
him."
355,ROB,355,But don't you remember?
356,LAURA,356,"I remember the song.  I just couldn't
remember who sang it."
357,LAURA,357,"I can see why you prefer Gaye to
Garfunkel.  I get it, really.  But
there are so many other things to
worry about.  They're only records,
and if one is better than the other,
well, who cares, besides you and
Barry and Dick?  I mean really, who
gives a flying fuck?"
358,ROB,358,"You used to care more about things
like Marvin Gaye than you do now.
When I first met you, and I made you
that tape, you loved it.  You said --
and I quote -- ""It was so good it
made you ashamed of your record
collection."""
359,LAURA,359,"Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay,
and I thought you were hot, and I
didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted
one."
360,ROB,360,"So you weren't interested in music
at all?"
361,LAURA,361,"Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am
now.  That's life though, isn't it?"
362,ROB,362,"But Laura... that's me.  That's all
there is to me.  There isn't anything
else.  If you've lost interest in
that, you've lost interest in
everything."
363,LAURA,363,You really believe that?
364,ROB,364,"Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our --
the apartment.  What else do I have,
other than records and CDs?"
365,LAURA,365,And do you like it that way?
366,ROB,366,Not really.
367,LAURA,367,Let's go in.
368,ROB,368,"Okay, Number two: The stuff I told
her about being unhappy in the
relationship, about half looking
around for someone else: She tricked
me into saying it.  We were having
this state of the union type
conversation and she said, quite
matter-of-factly, that we were pretty
unhappy at the moment, and did I
agree, and I said yes, and she asked
whether I ever thought about meeting
someone else.  So I asked her if she
ever thought about it, and she said
of course, so I admitted that I
daydream about it from time to time.
Now I see that what we were really
talking about was her and Ian, and
she suckered me into absolving her.
It was a sneaky lawyer's trick, and
I fell for it, because she's much
smarter than me."
369,ROB,369,You can take it with you if you want.
370,LAURA,370,"Have you tackled the Great
Reorganization yet?"
371,ROB,371,"Don't you think there are more
important things to talk about than
my record collection?"
372,LAURA,372,"You bet.  I've been saying that for
years."
373,ROB,373,"So.  Where have you been staying for
the last week?"
374,LAURA,374,I think you know that.
375,ROB,375,"Had to work it out for myself, though,
didn't I?"
376,LAURA,376,"I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair
to you.  That's why I came here to
the store this evening.  I feel
terrible, Rob.  This is really hard,
you know."
377,ROB,377,Good.
378,ROB,378,So.  Is it my job?
379,LAURA,379,"What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is
that what you think?  That your not
big enough a deal for me?  Jesus,
gimme a little credit, Rob."
380,ROB,380,"I don't know.  It's one of the things
I thought of."
381,LAURA,381,What were the others?
382,ROB,382,Just the obvious stuff.
383,LAURA,383,What's the obvious stuff?
384,ROB,384,I don't know.
385,LAURA,385,"I guess it's not that obvious, then."
386,ROB,386,No.
387,ROB,387,"And number three: The Pregnancy.  I
didn't know she was pregnant.  Of
course I didn't.  She hadn't told me
because I had told her I was... sort
of... seeing somebody else.  We
thought we were being very grown-up,
but we were being preposterously
naive, childish even, to think that
one of us could fuck around and then
own up to it while we were living
together.  So -- I didn't find out
about it 'til way later.  We were
going through a good period and I
made a crack about having kids and
she burst into tears.  I made her
tell me what it was all about, and
she did.  I felt guilty and so I got
angry.  She told me that at the time
I didn't look like a very good long-
term bet.  That it was a hard decision
and she didn't see any point in
consulting me about it...  When the
whole sorry tale comes out in a great
big --"
388,LAURA (O.S.),388,What?
389,ROB,389,"What, what?"
390,LAURA,390,Did you say something?
391,ROB,391,"No.  So.  Is it working out with
Ian?"
392,LAURA,392,Rob.  Don't be childish.
393,ROB,393,"Why is that childish?  Your living
with the guy!  I'm just asking how
it's going."
394,LAURA,394,"I am not living with him.  I've just
been staying with him for a few days
until I work out what I'm doing.
Look, this has nothing to do with
anyone else.  You know that, don't
you?  I left because we weren't
exactly getting along, and we weren't
talking about it.  And I suddenly
realized that I like my job, and I
like what my life is could be turning
into, and that I'm getting to a point
where I want to get my shit together
and I can't really see that ever
happening with you, and yeah, yeah,
I sort of get interested in someone
else, and that went further than it
should have, so it seemed like a
good time to go.  But I have no idea
what will happen with Ian in the
long run.  Probably nothing."
395,ROB,395,"Well then why don't you quit it while
you seem to not be ahead?"
396,ROB,396,"-- When the whole sorry tale comes
out in a great big lump like that,
even the most shortsighted jerk,
even the most self-deluding and self
pitying of jilted, wounded lovers
can see that there is some cause and
effect going on here, that abortions
and Ian and money and affairs all
belong to, all deserve each other."
397,LAURA,397,"Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll
get it together, you and me.  Maybe
I'll never see either of you again.
I don't know.  All I know is that
it's not a good time to be living
here."
398,ROB,398,"So, what, you haven't definitely
decide to dump me?  There's still a
chance we'll get back together?"
399,LAURA,399,I don't know.
400,ROB,400,"Well, if you don't know, there's a
chance, right?  It's like, if someone
was in the hospital and he was
seriously ill and the doctor said, I
don't know if he's got a chance of
survival or not, then that doesn't
mean the patient's definitely going
to die, now does it?  It means he
might live.  Even if it's only a
remote possibility."
401,LAURA,401,I suppose so.
402,ROB,402,"So we have a chance of getting back
together again."
403,LAURA,403,"Oh, Rob, shut up."
404,ROB,404,"Hey, I just want to know where I
stand.  What chance --"
405,LAURA,405,"-- I don't fucking know what chance
you fucking have!"
406,ROB,406,"Well if you could tell me roughly it
would help."
407,LAURA,407,"Okay, okay, we have a nine percent
chance of getting back together.
Does that clarify the situation?"
408,ROB,408,Yeah.  Great.
409,LAURA,409,"I'm too tired for this now.  I know
I'm asking a lot, but will you take
off for a while so I can get my stuff
packed up?  I need to be able to
think while I do it and I can't think
while you're here."
410,ROB,410,"No problem.  If I can ask one
question."
411,LAURA,411,Fine.  One.
412,ROB,412,It sounds stupid.
413,LAURA,413,Nevermind.
414,ROB,414,You won't like it.
415,LAURA,415,Just ask it!
416,ROB,416,Is it better?
417,LAURA,417,Is what better?  Better than what?
418,ROB,418,"Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with
him better?"
419,LAURA,419,"Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really
what's bothering you?"
420,ROB,420,Of course it is.
421,LAURA,421,"You really think it would make a
difference either way?"
422,ROB,422,I don't know.
423,LAURA,423,"Well the answer is that I don't know
either.  We haven't done it yet."
424,ROB,424,Never?
425,LAURA,425,I haven't felt like it.
426,ROB,426,"But not even before, when he was
living upstairs?"
427,LAURA,427,"No.  I was living with you, remember?
We've slept together but we haven't
made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell
you one thing.  The sleeping together
is better."
428,ROB,428,"The sleeping together is better but
not the sex because you haven't done
it was him yet."
429,LAURA,429,Will you please just go?
430,ROB,430,"I feel good!  I feel great!  I feel
like a new man.  I feel so much
better, in fact --"
431,ROB,431,"Hi, Marie."
432,MARIE,432,Everything go alright?
433,ROB,433,"She just wanted to pick up some stuff.
No big thing.  A relief, actually."
434,MARIE,434,"God, I hate that time.  That pick up
stuff time.  I just went through
that before I came here.  You know
that song ""Patsy Cline Times Two"" I
play?  That's about me and my ex
dividing up our record collections."
435,ROB,435,It's a great song.
436,MARIE,436,Thank you.
437,ROB,437,"Is that why you came to Chicago in
the first place?  Because of, you
know, dividing up your record
collection and stuff?"
438,MARIE,438,Yup.
439,ROB,439,You share a place with T-Bone?
440,MARIE,440,"No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I
wouldn't want to listen to all that
stuff happening on the other side of
the bedroom wall.  I'm way to
unattached for that."
441,ROB,441,I understand completely.
442,ROB (V.O.),442,"Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I
agreed that what really matters is
what you like, not what you are
like..."
443,MARIE,443,"Yeah, but if you heard this band
called the Crumblers, you'd --"
444,ROB,444,"What do you mean, the Crumblers?
You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's
heard the Crumblers.  Except me."
445,MARIE,445,"Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought
a used Blasters album in New York
about ten years ago and somebody
left a Crumblers single in it.  My
everything changed for a couple of
weeks."
446,ROB (V.O.),446,"Books, records, films -- these things
matter.  Call me shallow but it's
the damn truth, and by this measure
I was having one of the best dates
of my life."
447,ROB,447,"Yeah, but you know what's his best
film and nobody's even seen it?"
448,MARIE,448,The Conformist.
449,ROB,449,Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
450,MARIE,450,You haven't even seen it!
451,ROB,451,Nor have you!
452,ROB (V.O.),452,"References, titles, lyrics, flew and
met each other in mid-air embraces.
The evening goes with breathtaking
precision."
453,MARIE,453,Are you okay?
454,ROB,454,Yes.  You?
455,MARIE,455,"For now.  But I wouldn't be if I
thought this was the end of the
evening."
456,ROB,456,I'm sure it isn't.
457,MARIE,457,"Good.  In that case, I'll fix us
something else to drink.  You sticking
to the whiskey or you want coffee?"
458,ROB,458,Whiskey.
459,MARIE,459,"Tops off two whiskeys and starts
into the other room where she sees
Rob, standing and holding his jacket."
460,ROB,460,"I'd better go.  I gotta get up early.
Go over to my parents'."
461,MARIE,461,"When I said before that I hoped it
wasn't the end of the evening, I
was, you know... talking about
breakfast and stuff."
462,MARIE,462,"I'd like it if you could stay the
night."
463,ROB,463,"Oh, right.  Alright."
464,MARIE,464,"Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged
you for a master of understatement,
beating around the bush and all that
buzz."
465,ROB,465,"I use it but I don't understand it
when other people use it."
466,MARIE,466,So you'll stay?
467,ROB,467,Yeah.
468,MARIE,468,Good.
469,ROB,469,"Over nine million men in this country
have slept with ten or more women.
And do they all look like Richard
Gere?  Are they all as rich as Bill
Gates?  Charming as Oscar Wilde?
Hell no.  Nothing to do with any of
that.  Maybe fifty or so have one or
more of these attributes, but that
still leaves... well, about nine
million, give or take fifty.  And
they're just men.  Regular guys.
We're just guys, because I, even I,
am a member of this exclusive, nine
million member club.  In fact, Marie
is my seventeenth lover. ""How does
he do it?"" you ask. ""He wears bad
sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke,
he hangs out with the Musical Moron
Twins, and he gets to go to bed with
a recording artist who looks like
Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan.  What's
going on?  Listen up, because I think
I can explain, with all modesty aside:
I ask questions.  That's it.  That's
my secret.  It works precisely because
that isn't how you're supposed to do
it, if you listen to the collective
male wisdom.  There are still enough
old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs
running around to make someone like
me appear to be refreshingly
different.  If you can't hack this
simple strategy, there are some women
out there, of course, who want to
get pushed around, ignored and mowed
over, but do you really want to be
with them anyway?"
470,ROB,470,"Would you like me to turn the lights
out?  Or would you like them on?"
471,MARIE,471,"God, you ask a lot of questions."
472,ROB (V.O.),472,"But in the morning we were just two
people, slightly hung-over, who were
not in love, sharing the same space.
And I feel..."
473,ROB,473,"Sex is about the only grown-up thing
that I know how to do; It's weird,
then, that it's the only thing that
can make me feel like a ten-year-
old."
474,ROB,474,Which way are you going?
475,MARIE,475,That way.  You?
476,ROB,476,That way.
477,MARIE,477,And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
478,ROB,478,I'll call you.
479,MARIE,479,Right.
480,ROB,480,"Okay.  Top five side one track ones.
Number one... ""Janie Jones,"" the
Clash, from The Clash."
481,BARRY,481,Ehh.
482,ROB,482,"""Thunder Road,"" Bruce Springsteen,
from Born to Run. ""Smells Like Teen
Spirit,"" Nirvana, Nevermind."
483,BARRY,483,"Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough.
Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?"
484,ROB,484,"Shut up. ""Let's Get It On,"" Marvin
Gaye, from Let's Get It On. ""Airbag,""
Radiohead, from OK Computer."
485,BARRY,485,"Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's
sly declaration of new classic-status
slipped into a list of old classics!
Nice! ""Let's Get It On?"" Couldn't
you make it more obvious than that?"
486,DICK,486,Rob.  Phone.
487,DICK,487,It's Laura.
488,ROB,488,Hi.
489,LAURA,489,"Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope
of my receipts from last month and
I'm thinking I didn't take them with
me.  Have you seen them around?"
490,ROB,490,I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
491,LAURA,491,"I'm sorry to call, but I need that
stuff..."
492,ROB,492,"Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at
home.  I'll call you when I find it,
and then we'll talk."
493,LAURA,493,We'll talk some other time.
494,ROB,494,Great... That's great.
495,BARRY,495,"Rob!  What about the Beatles?  What
about the fucking Rolling Stones?
What about fucking... fucking...
Beethoven?  Track one side one of
the Fifth Symphony?  You shouldn't
be allowed to run a record shop.
You shouldn't be allowed to --"
496,ROB (V.O.),496,"There's something different about
the sound of her voice... And what
did she mean last night, she hasn't
slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does
""yet"" mean, anyway?  ""I haven't
seen... Evil Dead II yet."" What does
that mean?  It means you're going to
go, doesn't it?"
497,BARRY,497,"-- You're like a little squirrel of
music, storing away dead little nuts
of old garbage music, musical lint,
old shit, shit, shit --"
498,ROB,498,"-- Barry, if I were to say to you I
haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what
would that mean?"
499,ROB,499,"Just... come on, what would it mean
to you?  That sentence? ""I haven't
seen Evil Dead II yet?"""
500,BARRY,500,"To me, it would mean that you're a
liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with
Laura -- oops -- once with me and
Dick.  We had that conversation about
the possibilities of the guy making
ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth
Century."
501,ROB,501,"Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't
seen it and I said to you, ""I haven't
seen Evil Dead II yet,"" what would
you think?"
502,BARRY,502,"I'd think you were a cinematic idiot.
And I'd feel sorry for you."
503,ROB,503,"No, but would you think, from that
one sentence.  That I was going to
see it?"
504,BARRY,504,"I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling
here.  I don't understand any part
of this conversation.  You're asking
me what I would think if you told me
that you hadn't seen a film that
you've seen.  What am I supposed to
say?"
505,ROB,505,Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
506,BARRY,506,"""-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,""
yeah, yeah, I hear you --"
507,ROB,507,"Would you... would you get the
impression that I wanted to see it?"
508,BARRY,508,"Well... you couldn't have been
desperate to see it, otherwise you'd
have already gone..."
509,BARRY,509,"...But the word ""yet..."" Yeah, you
know what, I'd get the impression
that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise
you'd say you didn't really want to."
510,ROB,510,"But in your opinion, would I
definitely go?"
511,BARRY,511,"How the fuck am I supposed to know
that?  You might get sick of people
telling you you've really gotta go
see the movie."
512,ROB,512,Why would they care?
513,BARRY,513,"Because it's a brilliant film.  It's
funny, violent, and the soundtrack
kicks fucking ass."
514,BARRY,514,"I never thought I would say this,
but can I go work now?"
515,ROB,515,"Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a
customer in four hours."
516,BARRY,516,"Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7
o'clock."
517,ROB,517,Ha.
518,DICK,518,"I can't go to the club tonight, guys."
519,BARRY,519,Why?
520,BARRY,520,Who are you going to see?
521,DICK,521,Nobody.
522,BARRY,522,"Rob, looky looky.  Dick!  Are you
getting some?!"
523,BARRY,523,"Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out
on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie
LaSalle, and the best-looking and
most intelligent of all of us isn't
getting anything at all."
524,ROB,524,How do you know about that?
525,BARRY,525,"Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot?
I'm more bothered by Dick's thing.
How did this happen, Dick?  What
rational explanation can there
possibly be?  What's her name?"
526,DICK,526,Anna.
527,BARRY,527,"Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna
Conda?"
528,DICK,528,Anna Moss.
529,BARRY,529,"Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing.
The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green
and furry?"
530,ROB,530,"Shut the fuck up, Barry."
531,BARRY,531,"Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't
you?  You two have to stick together
now.  Boners United.  United in
getting some."
532,ROB,532,"Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find
true love someday."
533,BARRY,533,Suck my ass.
534,ROB,534,Terrific.
535,ROB,535,"Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's
an asshole."
536,DICK,536,"Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow,
Rob."
537,ROB,537,"Why does it bother Barry that much
that Dick is seeing someone?  He's
worried about how his life is turning
out, and he's lonely, and lonely
people are the bitterest of them
all."
538,ROB,538,"Hi.  It's me... I'm right outside...
I know... I know... I figured I could
just walk you to the train and you
could go... home.  Or whatever it
is... No!  Of course not -- okay.
I'll be right here."
539,ROB (V.O.),539,"Laura looks different.  Less stress-
out, more in control.  Something has
happened, maybe something real, or
maybe something in her head.  Whatever
it is, you can see that she thinks
she's started out on some new stage
in her life.  She hasn't.  I'm not
going to let her."
540,LAURA,540,"So, how are you?"
541,ROB,541,Have you slept with him yet?
542,LAURA,542,I told you I slept with him.
543,ROB,543,"No, not -- I mean have you, you know --"
544,LAURA,544,Is that why you wanted to see me?
545,ROB,545,I guess.
546,LAURA,546,"Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to
say?"
547,ROB,547,"I want you to say that you haven't,
and I want it to be the truth."
548,LAURA,548,I can't do that.
549,ROB,549,"Tonight we're gonna figure out the
five best angry songs about women.
Let's go..."
550,ROB,550,"You kind of have to start with Elvis
Costello, but where? ""Motel Matches?""
""I Want You?"" ""I Hope You're Happy
Now?"" ""Green Shirt?"" His records
should be sealed in cases that say
""in case of vicious betrayal, smash
glass."" ""Where Did You Sleep Last
Night,"" sure, but by Robert Johnson
or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair
track.  There are a couple to get
angry at instead of being angry with.
Some devil's advocate stuff.  The
Silver Jews could be good when you're
ready to start putting it all behind
you...  But I think we're getting
ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan.
Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan
would --The phone rings.  He pulls
off his headphones and picks it up
but says nothing."
551,LAURA (O.S.),551,"You must have known it would happen.
You couldn't have been entirely
unprepared.  Like you said, I've
been living with the guy.  We were
bound to get around to it sometime."
552,LAURA (O.S.),552,"And anyway, I keep trying to tell
you, that's not really the point, is
it?  The point is we got ourselves
into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you
there?  What are you thinking?"
553,ROB,553,Nothing.
554,LAURA (O.S.),554,"We can meet for another drink if you
want.  So I can explain it better.
I owe you that much."
555,ROB,555,"Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you
know."
556,LAURA (O.S.),556,Will you call me?
557,ROB,557,I don't have your number.
558,LAURA (O.S.),558,"Call me at work.  We can arrange to
meet properly.  I don't want this to
be the last conversation we have.  I
know what you're like."
559,ROB,559,"You do, huh."
560,ROB,560,"Yes, a residence, a Mr. Ian Raymond,
North Side... thank you."
561,ROB,561,"You know the worst thing about being
rejected?  The complete lack of
control due to loss of control."
562,ROB,562,"If I could only control the when and
how of being dumped by somebody then
it wouldn't seem as bad.  But then,
of course --"
563,ROB,563,"-- it wouldn't be rejection, would
it?  It would be mutual consent.  It
would be musical differences.  I
would be pursuing a solo career."
564,LAURA,564,Hello.
565,ROB,565,It's me.
566,LAURA,566,I figured it was.
567,LAURA,567,Where are you?
568,ROB,568,"I think the big question here is
where are you, if you don't mind my
saying so, and I think I know where
you are.  You're running.  On the
run.  You're running from a point
that everyone hits in any
relationship, and you're just going
to hit it again with Ian but it's
going to be with a World Music bunny-
rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing
""Doctor Who""-watching twit who doesn't
really understand you, not the way
that I do and will more in the future,
and you'll have just wasted more
time and arrive in the exact same
place that you're in now, only later.
And with... him."
569,LAURA,569,I'm not -- hold on...
570,LAURA,570,"I'm not in love with Ian, okay?"
571,ROB,571,Are you still in love with me?
572,LAURA,572,"Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to
you later."
573,ROB,573,"Think about what I said.  I mean, if
you want to experiment, or whatever --"
574,LAURA,574,"I'm not experimenting.  Why don't
you go experiment."
575,ROB,575,"I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I
love you."
576,LAURA,576,"You don't ever think about other
people?"
577,ROB,577,"No... not really... I mean, I think
about it... but no, I don't really
think about it."
578,IAN (O.S.),578,Laura?  Are you okay?
579,LAURA,579,I am fine...
580,LAURA,580,I gotta go.  Goodbye.
581,IAN,581,Are you sure you're okay?
582,LAURA,582,"Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone."
583,IAN,583,You look upset.
584,LAURA,584,"I'm upset, but I'm fine."
585,IAN,585,Maybe I should talk to him.
586,LAURA,586,"Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea."
587,IAN,587,"Conflict resolution is my job, Laura."
588,LAURA,588,"Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get
a drink."
589,LAURA,589,"C'mon, c'mon."
590,ROB,590,"I wish I could be one of those guys
who doesn't call, the kind of guy
that gets broken up with and appears
not to give a shit.  He doesn't make
an ass out of himself, or frighten
anybody, and this week I've done
both of those things.  One day Laura's
sorry and guilty, and the next she's
scared and angry, and I'm entirely
responsible for the transformation,
and it doesn't do my case any good
at all.  I'd stop if I could but I --"
591,ROB,591,Do I know you?
592,ALISON'S MOM,592,I don't know.
593,ROB,593,"You're Mrs. Ashworth.  I'm Rob.  An
old boyfriend of you're daughter's."
594,ROB,594,Alison's.
595,ALISON'S MOM,595,Really.
596,ROB,596,"Long time ago.  I was just thinking
about her.  I was her first boyfriend."
597,ROB,597,"Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior
high..."
598,ALISON'S MOM,598,"I hate to quibble with you Rob, but
she married her first boyfriend.
Kevin Bannister."
599,ROB,599,You gotta be kidding me.
600,ALISON'S MOM,600,"That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs.
Kevin Bannister.  She lives in
Australia."
601,ROB,601,"Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior
high sweetheart... What chance would
I have had against that?  None, no
chance.  That's just fate."
602,ALISON'S MOM,602,I beg your pardon?
603,ROB,603,"Technically, I'm number one.  I went
out with her a week before Kevin
did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me."
604,ALISON'S MOM,604,"Well Rob, I'll tell her you said
hello.  If she remembers you."
605,ROB,605,"I think she will.  But it's okay if
she doesn't.  I'm fine now."
606,ROB,606,"And suddenly I am fine.  For the
moment there is not one extra pound
on my chest.  This is fate.  Alison
married Kevin.  You get it?  That's
fate.  That's got nothing to do with
me, that is beyond my control, beyond
my fault..."
607,ROB,607,"I want to see the others on the Big
Top Five.  Penny, who wouldn't let
me touch her and then went and had
sex with that bastard Chris Thompson.
Sarah, my partner in rejection who
rejected me, and Charlie, who I have
to thank for everything: my great
job, my sexual self-confidence, the
works.  There's this Springsteen
song, ""Bobby Jean,"" off Born in the
USA.  About a girl who's left town
years before and he's pissed off
because he didn't know about it, and
he wanted to say goodbye, tell her
that he missed her, and wish her
good luck.  Well, I'd like my life
to be like a Springsteen song.  Just
once.  I know I'm not born to run,
and it's clear that Halsted Street
is nothing like Thunder Road, but
feelings can't be that different,
can they?  I'd like to call up all
those people and ask them how they
are and whether they've forgiven me,
and tell them that I have forgiven
them.  And say good luck, goodbye.
No hard feelings.  And then they'd
feel good and I'd feel good.  We'd
all feel good.  I'd feel clean, and
calm, and ready to start again.
That'd be good.  Great even."
608,ROB,608,"Penny Hardwick?  This is Rob Gordon...
From High school... Yeah."
609,ROB (V.O.),609,"Penny is as beautiful as she was in
high school when I broke it off with
her because she wouldn't sleep with
me.  In fact she's even more
beautiful, and really grown into
herself."
610,ROB (V.O.),610,"She tells me about her life, and I
get it.  And I tell about mine, and
she's interested."
611,ROB (V.O.),611,"And then, with no real explanation,
I just launch into it: I tell her
about Laura and Ian, and Charlie and
Marco, and about Alison Ashworth and
Kevin Bannister..."
612,ROB,612,"...and you wanted to sleep with Chris
Thompson instead of me, and... and I
thought you could help me understand
why it keeps happening, why I'm doomed
to be left, doomed to be rejected
and..."
613,PENNY,613,"Rob.  I was crazy about you.  I wanted
to sleep with you, one day, but not
when I was sixteen.  When you broke
up with me -- when you broke up with
me -- because I was, to use your
charming expression, tight, I cried
and cried and I hated you.  And then
that little shitbag asked me out,
and I was too tired to fight him
off, and it wasn't rape because I
said okay, but it wasn't far off.
And I didn't have sex with anyone
else until after college because I
hated it so much.  And now you want
to have a chat about rejection?
Well, fuck you, Rob."
614,ROB,614,"So that's another one I don't have
to worry about.  I should have done
this years ago."
615,ROB,615,Check...
616,ROB,616,"Sarah's easy to find.  She still
sends me Christmas cards with her
address and phone number on them.
They never say anything else, except
for ""Merry Christmas, Love Sarah."" I
send her equally blank ones back."
617,SARAH,617,"I can't believe I left you for him...
Crazy."
618,ROB,618,"Well... probably seemed like a good
idea at the time."
619,SARAH,619,"Probably.  I can't remember why,
though."
620,ROB (V.O.),620,"I haven't got the heart for the
rejection conversation.  There are
no hard feelings here, and I am glad
that she ditched me, and not the
other way around."
621,ROB,621,"I could've ended up having sex back
there.  And what better way to
exorcize rejection demons than to
screw the person who rejected you,
right?  But you wouldn't be sleeping
with a person.  You'd be sleeping
with a whole sad single-person
culture.  It'd be like sleeping with
Talia Shire in ""Rocky"" if you weren't
Rocky."
622,ROB,622,"Charlie's in the fucking phone book.
She has come to assume such an
importance, I feel she should be
living on Mars.  She's an
extraterrestrial, a ghost, a myth,
not a person with an answering
machine, in the phone book... I call
and hang up on her voice mail a couple
of times, then I leave my name and
number and throw in a ""long time-no-
see..."" I don't hear anything back
from her for a few days.  Now that's
more like it, if you're talking about
rejection: someone who won't even
return your phone messages a decade
after she rejected you."
623,ROB,623,Can I help you?
624,IAN,624,"Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray.
Ian."
625,IAN,625,"I thought maybe we should talk.
Sort a few things out?"
626,ROB,626,What needs sorting out?
627,IAN,627,"Come on, Rob.  My relationship with
Laura has obviously disturbed you a
great deal."
628,ROB,628,"Funnily enough I haven't been too
thrilled about it."
629,IAN,629,"We are not talking jokey
understatement here, Rob.  We're
talking actionable harassment.  Ten
phone calls a night, hanging around
outside my house..."
630,ROB,630,"Yeah, well, I've stopped all that
now."
631,IAN,631,"We've noticed and we're glad.  But,
you know... how are we going to make
peace here?  We want to make things
easier for you.  What can we do?
Obviously I know how special Laura
is, and I know things can't be good
for you at the moment.  I'd hate it
if I lost her.  But I'd like to think
that if she decided she didn't want
to see me anymore, I'd respect that
decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?"
632,ROB,632,Yeah.
633,IAN,633,"Good.  So shall we leave it at that
then?"
634,ROB,634,I dunno.
635,IAN,635,"Think about it, Rob."
636,IAN,636,"Good.  So shall we leave it at that
then?"
637,ROB,637,"I've already left it, you pathetic
rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli
stink out of my store."
638,IAN,638,"Good.  So shall we leave it at that
then?"
639,ROB,639,"We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever."
640,DICK,640,"Don't do it, Rob!"
641,BARRY,641,He's not worth it!
642,ROB,642,"Leave town.  Leave the country, you
little bitch, because you're gonna
look back on walks by the house and
ten phone calls a night as a golden
age.  Get ready, mutherfucker."
643,IAN,643,So shall we leave it at that then?
644,ROB,644,I dunno.
645,IAN,645,"Think about it, Rob."
646,DICK,646,"Phone, Rob.  Somebody named Charlie."
647,BATHROOM,647,Rob curls up with the phone.
648,ROB,648,Hello?
649,CHARLIE,649,"Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call.
In LA on business.  You know how it
gets."
650,ROB,650,"Yeah, sure..."
651,CHARLIE,651,"Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob
Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million
years ago now."
652,ROB,652,"Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are
you?"
653,CHARLIE,653,"Fantastic but I'm a little busy right
now.  Listen.  Do you want to come
to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some
friends over and I need a spare man.
Are you a spare man?"
654,ROB,654,"Uh...yes, at the moment."
655,CHARLIE,655,Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
656,ROB,656,Hey Charlie.
657,CHARLIE,657,Hey Rob.
658,ROB,658,"Why did you break up with me for
Marco?"
659,CHARLIE,659,"Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going
through one of those what-does-it-
all-mean things."
660,ROB,660,Huh?
661,CHARLIE,661,"There's been a rash of them, recently.
I find it a little unnerving.  In
fact Marco called a few months back,
and he wanted to see me, and rehash
the past as they say, and I wasn't
really up for it.  Do all men go
through this?"
662,ROB,662,"C'mon, just answer the question.
You can say what you like.  What the
hell?"
663,CHARLIE,663,"It's all kind of lost in the... in
the dense mists of time now... It
wasn't that I really liked Marco
more.  In fact I thought you were
more, shall we say, attractive than
him.  It was just that he knew he
was good-looking and you didn't, and
that made a difference somehow.  You
used to act as if I was weird for
wanting to spend time with you, and
that got kind of beat, if you know
what I mean.  Your self-image started
to rub off on me and I ended up
thinking that I was strange.  And I
knew that you were kind and
thoughtful... you made me laugh, and
I dug the way you got consumed by
things you loved... and Marco seemed
a bit more, I don't know, glamorous?
More sure of himself?"
664,CHARLIE,664,"Less hard work, because I felt like
I was dragging you around, sort of."
665,CHARLIE,665,A little sunnier.  Sparkier.
666,CHARLIE,666,"I don't know.  You know what people
are like at that age.  They make
very superficial judgements.  Do you
think that's superficial?  He was a
clown, if it's any consolation."
667,ROB,667,"Did you tell that to Marco when he
did his what-does-it-all-mean thing
with you?"
668,CHARLIE,668,"Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt
his feelings."
669,ROB,669,"I wanted the works and I got it.
None of Alison Ashworth's fate, none
of Sarah's rewriting of history, and
no reminder that I'd got all the
rejection stuff a little backward,
like I did about Penny.  Just a
perfectly clear explanation of why
some people have it and some don't.
All I've learned from Charlie is
that maybe my one talent, my genius
for being normal, is a little
overrated."
670,BARRY,670,Hey.
671,ROB,671,What the fuck is that?
672,BARRY,672,My band.
673,ROB,673,What band?
674,BARRY,674,"The band that found me and asked me
to join."
675,ROB,675,"You are not in a band, Barry.  You
are not a musician.  And no posters."
676,BARRY,676,"Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really
appreciate it."
677,ROB,677,"Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no
end to your arrogance?"
678,BARRY,678,"I didn't make up the name.  It's the
Steely Dan song.  And it was in The
Commitments."
679,ROB,679,"You can't be called Barry and sing
in a group called Barrytown."
680,BARRY,680,"They were fucking called that before
I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my
idea."
681,ROB,681,"That's why you got the gig, isn't
it?"
682,ROB,682,Isn't it?
683,BARRY,683,"That was one of the reasons they
asked me to join originally, yes.
But --"
684,ROB,684,"Great!  That's fucking great!  They
only asked you to sing because of
your name!  You can stick it above
the browser racks over there."
685,BARRY,685,"How many tickets can I put you down
for?"
686,ROB,686,None.  Christ!
687,BARRY,687,You're not even coming?
688,ROB,688,"Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look
like I'd want to listen to some
terrible experimental racket played
in some hideous cave?  Where is it?"
689,ROB,689,The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
690,BARRY,690,"So much for friends, then.  You're a
bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?"
691,ROB,691,"Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown?
You should be shot like a lame horse,
you jerk."
692,ROB,692,Just keep that out of my window.
693,LAURA,693,"I called and called but you were
out.  I thought I'd be gone before
you got back."
694,ROB,694,Is that the last of it?
695,LAURA,695,"Yep.  I might have missed some stuff.
I'm so used to some things being
here that I don't even notice them."
696,ROB,696,Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
697,LAURA,697,"He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe
he went to the store.  I'm mortified,
actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had
no right to do that, and I told him
so."
698,ROB,698,It was kind of funny.
699,LAURA,699,I'm sure.
700,ROB,700,You still together?  Going all right?
701,LAURA,701,"I don't really want to talk about
it, to be honest."
702,ROB,702,"That bad, eh?"
703,LAURA,703,You know what I mean.
704,ROB,704,"It's a dump, isn't it?"
705,LAURA,705,"Fix it up.  It'll make you feel
better."
706,ROB,706,"I'll bet you can't remember what you
were doing here, can you?  I mean,
how much are you making now?  Sixty?
Seventy?  And you were living in
this shitty place."
707,LAURA,707,"You know I didn't mind.  And it's
not as if Ray's place is any better."
708,ROB,708,"I'm sorry, but can we get this
straight?  What is his fucking name,
Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?"
709,LAURA,709,Ray.  I hate Ian.
710,ROB,710,"I hate him too.  So I just call him
""Mavis."" Or ""Sissyboy."" Or ""Mavis
the Sissyboy."""
711,ROB,711,"This is where you're supposed to say
that you haven't laughed this much
in ages, and then you see the error
of your ways."
712,LAURA,712,"You make me laugh much more than Ray
does, if that's what you're getting
at.  But I already knew you could
make me laugh.  It's everything else
I don't know about."
713,ROB,713,You know I'm a good person.
714,LAURA,714,Mmm hmm.
715,ROB,715,"You know that I can cook my ass off
when I feel like it."
716,LAURA,716,"Oh ho, so very infrequently."
717,ROB,717,"You know my favorite beverage is
your bath water."
718,LAURA,718,Time to go.
719,ROB,719,Don't forget your CDs.
720,LAURA,720,Those aren't mine.
721,ROB,721,Sure they are.
722,LAURA,722,"They're not really, though, are they?
I know you bought them for me, and
that was really sweet of you, but
that was when you were trying to
turn me into you.  I can't take them,
I know they'd just sit around staring
at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by
them and... they don't fit in with
the rest of what's mine, do you
understand?  That Sting record you
bought for me... that was a present
for me.  I like Sting and you hate
him.  But the rest of this stuff..."
723,LAURA,723,"Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram
Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't
know these people.  I..."
724,ROB,724,"Okay, okay.  I get the picture."
725,LAURA,725,"I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I
don't know, there's a lesson here
somewhere, and I want to make sure
you get it."
726,ROB,726,"I got it.  You like Sting but you
don't like Gram Parsons, because
you've never heard of him."
727,LAURA,727,You're being deliberately obtuse.
728,ROB,728,I guess I am.
729,LAURA,729,"Well, think about it."
730,ROB,730,Fuck.
731,ROB,731,"What's the point in thinking about
it?  If I ever have another
relationship, I'll buy her, whoever
she is, stuff that she oughta like
but doesn't know about -- that's
what new boyfriends are for.  And
hopefully I won't borrow money from
her, or have an affair, and she won't
need to have an abortion or run away
with the neighborhood, and then there
won't be anything to think about.
Laura didn't run off with Ian because
I bought her CDs she wasn't that
keen on, and to pretend otherwise is
just... just... psychowank.  If she
thinks that, then she's missing the
Brazilian rainforest for the twigs.
If I can't buy the Plastic People of
the Universe's first album for new
girlfriends, then I might as well
give up, because I'm not sure I know
how to do anything else."
732,LAURA (O.S.),732,Hello.
733,ROB,733,"Hey, how ya doin'?"
734,ROB,734,"Guess who I just saw, right by my
store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat,
huh?"
735,LAURA (O.S.),735,I can't talk right now.
736,ROB,736,"God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe
you should bet back in bed."
737,ROB,737,Are you alright?
738,LAURA (O.S.),738,Pigsty.
739,ROB,739,"Don't worry about it.  Just get into
bed.  Worry about that when you're
better."
740,LAURA (O.S.),740,Pig died.
741,ROB,741,Who the fuck's Pig?
742,LAURA (O.S.),742,"My dad died.  My dad, my dad."
743,BARRY,743,What's up?
744,ROB,744,Laura.  Her dad died.
745,BARRY,745,Ooh.  Drag.
746,DICK,746,"I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --"
747,ROB,747,"You're a horrible person, Barry.  I
mean it."
748,BARRY,748,"Hey.  Top five songs about death.  A
Laura's Dad Tribute list."
749,BARRY,749,"Okay, okay -- ""Leader of the Pack.""
The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle
and dies right? ""Dead Man's Curve,""
Jan and Dean..."
750,DICK,750,"Did you know that after that song
was recorded, Jan himself crashed
his --"
751,BARRY,751,"-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot."
752,ROB,752,"It was Jan, and it was a long time
after--"
753,BARRY,753,"Whatever.  Okay. ""Tell Laura I Love
Her."" That'd bring the house down.
Laura's mom could sing it."
754,ROB,754,"Fuck off, Barry."
755,BARRY,755,"I'd want ""One Step Beyond"" by Madness.
And ""You Can't Always Get What You
Want."""
756,ROB,756,Because it's in The Big Chill.
757,BARRY,757,Haven't seen it.
758,ROB,758,"Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence
Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat."
759,BARRY,759,"Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about
that.  I wasn't biting the idea."
760,ROB,760,Not really.
761,ROB,761,Record Exchange.
762,LAURA,762,I'm sorry.
763,ROB,763,"No, no.  When are you going home?"
764,LAURA,764,In a minute.  When I get it together.
765,BARRY,765,"What about Sabbath?  Or Nirvana?
They're into death."
766,ROB,766,Can I do anything?
767,DICK,767,"""Abraham, Martin, and John."" That's
a nice one."
768,BARRY,768,"""Somebody's Gonna Die"" by Blitz.
""Bella Lugosi's Dead,"" Bauhaus.
It's got that creepy Halloween
feeling."
769,LAURA,769,"No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to
the funeral.  It's on Friday."
770,ROB,770,Me?
771,LAURA,771,"My dad liked you.  And Mom never
told him we'd split, because he wasn't
up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I
don't really understand it.  I think
she thinks he'll be able to see what's
going on.  It's like..."
772,LAURA,772,"He's been through so much, what with
dying and everything, that she doesn't
want to upset him any more than she
has to."
773,ROB,773,Do you want me to be there?
774,LAURA,774,"I don't care.  As long as you don't
expect me to hold your hand."
775,LAURA,775,"Look, are you coming or not?"
776,ROB,776,"Yes, of course."
777,LAURA,777,"Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows
where to go and everything... I don't
have time to talk, Rob.  I've got
too much to do."
778,ROB,778,Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
779,BARRY,779,"""Goodbye Laura's dad/blah blah la di
da di da/"
780,BARRY,780,"Seems to me/you lived your life/like
a dentist in the wind..."
781,ROB,781,"So the minister says nice things,
and then, what, we all troop outside
and they bury him?"
782,LIZ,782,It's a crematorium.
783,ROB,783,"You're kidding.  A crematorium?
Jesus."
784,LIZ,784,What difference does it make?
785,ROB,785,Is Ray going?
786,LIZ,786,"No.  They don't know him.  And Ken
liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for
your benefit, you know.  It's like
everybody's a supporting actor in
the film of your life story."
787,ROB,787,Isn't that how it is for everybody?
788,MINISTER,788,"...Now and forever, Amen."
789,ROB (V.O.),789,"I hear something in Laura's voice,
but I know what it is, and at that
moment I want to go to her and offer
to become a different person, to
remove all trace of what is me, as
long as she will let me look after
her and try to make her feel better..."
790,ROB (V.O.),790,"...And when she let's go of me, I
feel I don't need to become a
different person.  It's happened
already."
791,LIZ,791,How are you?
792,JO,792,"I'm all right, I suppose.  And Mom's
not too bad.  But Laura... I dunno."
793,LIZ,793,"She's had a pretty rough few weeks
already, without this.  It's hard
when you're putting all of your
efforts into one part of your life
and it doesn't work out."
794,ROB,794,"Don't mind me.  No problem.  Just
pretend you're talking about somebody
else."
795,LIZ,795,"We are talking about somebody else.
Laura.  Laura and Ray, actually."
796,ROB,796,"Enough, Liz."
797,LIZ,797,Enough of what?
798,ROB,798,"I know I can't speak now because
Laura's father died, and I just have
to take it because otherwise I'm a
bad guy, with the emphasis on guy,
self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking
not, not all the time, anyway, I'm
really sorry Jo."
799,ROB,799,"But you know, Liz... I can either
stick up for myself or believe
everything you say about me and end
up hating myself.  And maybe you
think I should, but it's not much of
a life, you know?"
800,LIZ,800,"Maybe I've been a little unfair.
But is this really the time?"
801,ROB,801,"Only because it's never the time.  I
can't go on apologizing my whole
life, you know?"
802,LIZ,802,"If by ""we"" you are referring to men,
then I have to say that just the
once would do."
803,ROB,803,I'm sorry.
804,LAURA,804,"Are you going to lie in that flower
bed all night?"
805,ROB,805,Uh... No.
806,LAURA,806,You're soaking.
807,ROB,807,Mmnn.
808,LAURA,808,You're also an idiot.
809,ROB,809,"I can see why you say that.  Look,
I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last
thing I wanted was... that's why I
left, because... I lost it, and I
didn't want to blow my top in there,
and... look, the reason I fucked
everything up was because I was
scared.  I just wanted you to know,
that's all."
810,LAURA,810,"Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't
reciprocate."
811,ROB,811,What do you mean?
812,LAURA,812,"I didn't mess things up because I
was scared.  I slept with Ray because
I was sick of you.  And I needed
something to snap me out of it."
813,ROB,813,"Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't
want to take up any more of your
time.  You get back, and I'll wait
here for a bus."
814,LAURA,814,I don't want to go back.
815,ROB,815,What do you want to do?
816,LAURA,816,C'mon.
817,ROB,817,When are you going back?
818,LAURA,818,"I don't know.  Sometime.  Later.
Listen, Rob, would you have sex with
me?"
819,ROB,819,What?
820,LAURA,820,"I want to feel something else than
this.  It's either that or I go home
and put my hand in the fire.  Unless
you want to stub cigarettes out on
my arm."
821,ROB,821,"I've only got a couple left.  I'm
saving them for later."
822,LAURA,822,"It'll have to be sex, then."
823,LAURA,823,"Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago
that I looked at you from here."
824,ROB,824,Hi.
825,LAURA,825,"I knew there was a reason I wore a
skirt today."
826,ROB,826,"You know, with Ray..."
827,LAURA,827,"Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through
that again."
828,ROB,828,"No, no.  It's not... are you still
on the pill?"
829,LAURA,829,"Yes, of course.  There's nothing to
worry about."
830,ROB,830,"I didn't mean that.  I mean... was
that all you used?"
831,ROB,831,"Look, we can do other things."
832,LAURA,832,"I lived with you.  You were my partner
just a few weeks ago and now you're
worried I might kill you, and you're
entitled to worry.  Isn't that a
terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?"
833,ROB,833,"Later, I wonder if I was really
worried about where Ian has been.  I
have no idea where he's been, and
that gives me every right to insist
on protection.  But in truth, it was
the power that interested me more
than the fear.  I wanted to hurt
her, on this day of all days, just
because it's the first time since
she's left that I've been able to."
834,ROB,834,Laura...
835,LAURA,835,"I'm too tired not to go out with
you."
836,ROB,836,"So if you had a bit more energy we'd
stay split.  But things being how
they are, what with you wiped out,
you'd like us to get back together."
837,LAURA,837,"Everything's too hard.  Maybe another
time I would have the guts to be on
my own, but not now I don't."
838,ROB,838,What about Ian?
839,LAURA,839,"Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what
that was all about, except that
sometimes you need someone to lob
into the middle of a bad relationship
like a hand grenade, I guess, and
blow it all apart."
840,ROB,840,Mission accomplished.
841,LAURA,841,"I know it's not very romantic, but
there will be romance again at some
stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need
you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know
each other and we care for each other,
and you've made it clear that you
want me back, so..."
842,LAURA,842,Let's go home.  Okay?
843,ROB,843,Okay.
844,ROB,844,"But wouldn't you know it?  Suddenly
I feel panicky, and sick, and I want
to run around and sleep with female
recording artists..."
845,ROB,845,C'mon.  I want to know.
846,LAURA,846,"Want to know what, exactly?"
847,ROB,847,What it was like.
848,LAURA,848,"It was like sex.  What else could it
be like?"
849,ROB,849,"Was it like good sex or was it like
bad sex?"
850,LAURA,850,What's the difference?
851,ROB,851,You know the difference.
852,LAURA,852,"Look, we're okay now.  We just had a
nice time.  Let's leave it at that."
853,ROB,853,"Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the
nice time we just had... was it nicer,
as nice, or less nice than the nice
times you were having a couple of
weeks ago?"
854,ROB,854,"Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something.
Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking
you questions and it'd make me feel
better."
855,LAURA,855,"Well I was gonna lie and now I can't,
because you'd know I was lying."
856,ROB,856,"Well why the fuck would you want to
lie, anyway?"
857,LAURA,857,To make you feel better.
858,ROB,858,"Oh, great..."
859,LAURA,859,"Look, Rob.  If great sex was as
important as you think it is, and if
I was having great sex with him,
then we wouldn't be lying here now.
And that is my last word on the
subject, okay?"
860,ROB,860,Okay.
861,LAURA,861,"I wish your penis was as big as his,
though."
862,LAURA,862,"... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or
New York, even."
863,ROB,863,"Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is,
tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box
full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on
the Sub label, and I'll pay for it
that way."
864,LAURA,864,"I'll pay for you.  Even though you
owe me money.  We have to do something
with the money I earn.  I need to.
I deserve it.  You can just think of
it as winning the lottery."
865,ROB,865,Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
866,LAURA,866,"Money does not matter.  I do not
care how much you earn.  I'd just
like you to be a little happier in
your work, but beyond that you can
do what you like."
867,ROB,867,"But it wasn't supposed to be like
this.  When I met you we were the
same people and now we're not, and..."
868,LAURA,868,How?  How were we the same people?
869,ROB,869,"Well, you were the kind of person
who came to the Artful Dodger and I
was the kind of person who deejayed
at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans
and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I
still do, and you don't."
870,LAURA,870,"Because I'm not allowed to.  I still
do, after work.  So, what?  Should
we just break up?  Is that what you're
saying?  Because if you are, I'm
going to run out of patience."
871,ROB,871,"No, but..."
872,LAURA,872,But what?
873,ROB,873,"But why doesn't it matter that we're
not the same people we used to be?"
874,LAURA,874,"You haven't changed so much as a
pair of socks in the years I've known
you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm
the one who's done the growing, and
all I've done is change jobs."
875,ROB,875,"And hairstyles and clothes and
attitude and friends and..."
876,LAURA,876,"I can't go to work with my hair dyed
pink.  And I can afford to go shopping
more now, and I've met a couple people
I like over the last year or so."
877,ROB,877,You're tougher.
878,LAURA,878,"More confident, maybe."
879,ROB,879,Harder.
880,LAURA,880,"Less neurotic.  Are you intending to
stay the same for the rest of your
life?"
881,ROB,881,I'm alright.
882,LAURA,882,"Yeah, you're alright.  But you're
certainly not happy.  So what happens
if you get happy?  And yes I know
that's the title of an Elvis Costello
album, I use the reference
deliberately to catch your attention.
Should we split up because I'm used
to you being miserable?  What happens
if you, I don't know, start you're
own record label, and it's a success?
Time for a new girlfriend?"
883,ROB,883,You're being stupid.
884,LAURA,884,"How?  What would be the difference
between you having a record label
and me going from legal aid to private
practice?"
885,LAURA,885,"All I'm saying is, you have to allow
for things to happen to people, most
of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's
the use?"
886,ROB,886,No use.
887,ROB,887,What is this.
888,DICK,888,It's Vince and Justin.
889,ROB,889,Who's that?
890,BARRY,890,The little skate-fuckers.
891,ROB,891,No way.
892,BARRY,892,Yes way.  It's really...
893,BARRY,893,It's really fucking good.
894,ROB,894,Your tape.  It's good.
895,ROB,895,"It's rough.  But it shows promise.
We record a couple of songs right,
in a studio.  I'll take care of the
rest.  I'll put out your record.
Any profits after recouping expenses
get split down the middle, between
us and you guys."
896,VINCE,896,"Wait a minute.  Island Records charged
U2 a million five against their
overhead for one plane ride."
897,ROB,897,"We're not there yet, Justin."
898,VINCE,898,I'm Vince.
899,ROB,899,Whatever.
900,ROB,900,Hey.  What's the name of your band?
901,JUSTIN,901,The Kinky Wizards.
902,ROB,902,What?
903,VINCE,903,"We saw this ad in the personals for
two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance
fair."
904,ROB,904,Nice.
905,VINCE,905,What's the name of your label?
906,ROB,906,Broken Records.  Welcome aboard.
907,BARRY,907,What the fuck is that?
908,ROB,908,What?
909,BARRY,909,"I heard you, man.  Don't give me
that ""what"" shit.  You just told
them that you're gonna put out a
record with them."
910,ROB,910,So?  You even said they're good.
911,BARRY,911,"HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around
here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr.
Phil Spector?"
912,LAURA,912,"Hey, Barry."
913,BARRY,913,"Oh, hi."
914,LAURA,914,Where's Rob?
915,BARRY,915,"The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street
is in his executive suite.  Do you
have an appointment?"
916,LAURA,916,What are you talking about?
917,BARRY,917,"Just that Rob seems to think it would
be wiser to start a record label by
putting out a record with business-
crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters
than with someone he knows in his
bitter jealous heart is a musical
visionary.  That's all."
918,ROB,918,Hi.
919,LAURA,919,Hi.  What are you doing?
920,ROB,920,Nothing.
921,LAURA,921,Wanna go to dinner?
922,ROB,922,Where?
923,LAURA,923,"At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from
work."
924,ROB,924,"Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along.
Paul and I."
925,LAURA,925,"I know.  But you've never met.  It
just seems like a stone unturned in
your relationship with him."
926,ROB,926,Ha.
927,ROB,927,"We're at a point where I can't really
walk away from gauntlets she might
throw down, and so I go.  And wouldn't
you know it, I sort of fall in love
with Paul and Miranda -- with what
they have, and the way they treat
each other, and the way they make me
feel as if I'm the new center of
their world.  I think they're great,
and I want to see them twice a week,
every week, for the rest of my life.
Only right at the end of the evening
do I realize I've been set up."
928,PAUL,928,"Lame, right?"
929,ROB,929,"Oh, I don't know.  The Beatles are
okay."
930,PAUL,930,We're kinda out of date.
931,ROB,931,"Hey, to each his own, I say."
932,PAUL,932,"Maybe we can come by your store and
you can hook us up."
933,ROB,933,"Sure, sure.  Any time."
934,LAURA,934,"Better hurry, though, Paul.  Rob
started a record label, so he's gonna
be in the shop less and less."
935,LAURA,935,"...""To each his own!"" Unbelievable!
You!  Rob Gordon said that.  You
even sounded like you meant it."
936,ROB,936,"You did that deliberately.  You knew
all along I'd like them.  It was a
trick."
937,LAURA,937,"I tricked you into meeting some people
you'd think were great.  I thought
it would be fun to introduce you to
someone with a Tina Turner album and
then see whether you still felt the
same way."
938,LAURA,938,I called Dan Koretzky because he --
939,ROB,939,"Has Drag City Records, I know, I
know.  You told Dan Koretzky about
this?"
940,LAURA,940,"Yeah, and he said it's a good way to
break out a record.  Especially for
what he said, and I quote, ""would be
a highly anticipated event, locally.""
He helped me put out a press release."
941,ROB,941,WHAT?
942,LAURA,942,"Just local, of course."
943,ROB,943,"And the ""triumphant return of DJ Rob
Gordon?"" ""Triumphant?"" ""Return?"""
944,LAURA,944,"I had that idea when I was living
with Ian and it was such a good idea
that I was annoyed we weren't together
anymore.  It might even be why I
came back."
945,ROB,945,"You had no right.  Supposing I was
doing something that couldn't be
cancelled?"
946,LAURA,946,"What do you ever do that can't be
cancelled?"
947,ROB,947,"That's not the point.  I mean, what
if the single isn't done in time?"
948,LAURA,948,Barry said its done.
949,ROB,949,Barry?  Barry knows about this?
950,LAURA,950,Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
951,ROB,951,Like fuck you are.
952,BARRY,952,"Laura said we could.  If we helped
out with the posters and stuff.  And
we did.  And we are."
953,ROB,953,"I'll give you 10% of the door if you
don't play."
954,BARRY,954,We're getting that anyway.
955,ROB,955,"What is she doing?  Okay, 20%."
956,BARRY,956,No.  We need the gig.
957,ROB,957,"110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm
not kidding.  That's how much it
means to me not to hear you play."
958,BARRY,958,"We're not as bad as you think, Rob."
959,ROB,959,"You couldn't be.  Look, Barry.
There's going to be people from
Laura's work there, people who own
dogs and babies and Tina Turner
albums.  How are you going to cope
with them?"
960,BARRY,960,"We're not called Barrytown anymore,
by the by.  They got sick of the
Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called
SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey."
961,ROB,961,Sonic Death Monkey.
962,BARRY,962,What do you think?  Dick likes it.
963,ROB,963,"Barry, you're over thirty years old.
You owe it to yourself and your
friends and to your parents not to
sing in a group called Sonic Death
Monkey."
964,BARRY,964,"I owe it to myself to go right to
the edge, Rob, and this group does
exactly that.  Over the edge, in
fact."
965,ROB,965,"You'll be going over the fucking
edge if you come anywhere near me
next Friday night."
966,BARRY,966,"That's what we want.  Reaction.  And
if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends
can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let
'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll
be ready."
967,LAURA,967,"They'll go on early.  Nobody will
even be there yet and I told them
they can't play for more than a half
hour."
968,ROB,968,"It's no joke.  I'm responsible for
what happens, you know.  Embarrassment
aside, there's a lot of money and
effort in this, at least by my
standards.  I have to put down a
deposit for the room.  I have to pay
the pressing plant for the records,
sleeve them, sticker them --"
969,LAURA,969,We took care of that.
970,LAURA,970,"Barry and Dick and me.  Look in the
bedroom."
971,ROB,971,"I suddenly feel choked up.  It's not
the money, it's the way she's thought
of everything: one morning I woke up
to find her going through my records,
pulling out things that she remembered
me playing when I deejayed and putting
them into the little carrying cases
that I used to use and put away in a
closet somewhere years ago.  She
knew I needed a kick in the ass.
She also knew how happy I was when I
used to deejay.  From which every
angle I examine it, it still looks
as though she's done all of this
because she loves me."
972,ROB,972,"I'm sorry I've been acting like a
jerk.  I do appreciate what you've
done for me, and I know you've done
it for the best possible reasons,
and I do love you, even though I act
like I don't."
973,LAURA,973,"That's okay.  You seem pissed off
all the time, though."
974,ROB,974,I know.  I don't get it.
975,ROB,975,"But if I had to take a wild guess,
I'd say that I'm pissed because I
know I'm stuck with Laura, bound to
her, and I don't like it.  That dreamy
anticipation you have when you're
fifteen or twenty or thirty even,
that the most perfect person in the
world might walk into your store or
office or friend's party at any
moment... That's all gone, I think,
and that's enough to piss anybody
off.  Laura is who I am now, and
it's no good pretending otherwise..."
976,CAROLINE,976,Excuse me?
977,ROB,977,May I help you?
978,CAROLINE,978,I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
979,ROB,979,Uh.  That's me.
980,CAROLINE,980,"I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader.
I want to do a story on you."
981,ROB,981,Right.  Why?
982,CAROLINE,982,"Well, I used to go to the Dodger on
your nights, and I saw you're doing
it again and that your putting out a
record, and it's sort of a then-and-
now story against the backdrop of
the Chicago music scene with the
emphasis on now."
983,ROB,983,Oh.  Okay.
984,CAROLINE,984,"I thought I would ask you a few
questions if that's okay."
985,ROB,985,"Huh.  You used to come to the club?
I shouldn't have let you in.  You
must have only been about sixteen."
986,ROB,986,"What I mean is, I didn't mean you
look young.  You don't.  You don't
look old either.  You look just as
old as you are.  A bit younger maybe,
but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right."
987,CAROLINE,987,So.  Is now a good time?
988,CAROLINE,988,"Right.  So.  You must have an enormous
record collection."
989,ROB,989,"Yeah.  I could show it to you if you
want to come over and see it."
990,CAROLINE,990,"Yeah, well... Let's see... What are
you're all-time top five records?"
991,ROB,991,Pardon me?
992,CAROLINE,992,Your desert island top-five.
993,ROB,993,"Oh boy... In the club, or at home?"
994,CAROLINE,994,Is there a difference?
995,ROB,995,"OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. ""Sin
City"" by the Flying Burrito Brothers
is an all-time top five, but I
wouldn't play it at the club.  It's
a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd
go home."
996,CAROLINE,996,Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
997,ROB,997,"What do you mean, four more?"
998,CAROLINE,998,"Well if one of them is this ""Sin
City"" thing --"
999,ROB,999,"Can I go home and work this out and
let you know?  In a week or so?"
1000,CAROLINE,1000,"Look if you can't think of anything,
it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My
five favorite from the old days at
the Dodger."
1001,ROB,1001,"Oh, I'm sure I can manage something...
""Sin City."" ""New Rose,"" by The Damned.
""Hit It and Quit It"" by Funkadelic.
""Shipbuilding,"" Elvis Costello,
Japanese import, no horns, or
different horns, anyway... um...
""Mystery Train"" by Elvis Presley...
And... ""Spaced Cowboy"" by Sly and
the Family Stone.  A bit
controversial, I know, but..."
1002,CAROLINE,1002,Fine.  That's great.
1003,ROB,1003,Is that it?
1004,CAROLINE,1004,"Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat,
if you got the time."
1005,ROB,1005,"Sure, but is that it for the list?"
1006,CAROLINE,1006,"That's five.  So.  Why did you decide
to deejay again?"
1007,ROB,1007,"Well it was a friend's idea, really,
and the record release party seemed
like a good place to do it.  So..."
1008,ROB,1008,"I should really put a James Brown in
there --"
1009,CAROLINE,1009,Nice friend.
1010,ROB,1010,Yeah.
1011,CAROLINE,1011,What's his name?
1012,ROB,1012,"Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is
Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a
girl."
1013,CAROLINE,1013,"""Music for Old People."" What does
that mean?"
1014,ROB,1014,"Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd
like ""the Upsetter"" by Lee ""Scratch""
Perry, in there.  Instead of ""Sin
City."""
1015,CAROLINE,1015,"Okay. ""Dance Music For Old People?"""
1016,ROB,1016,"Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't
too old for clubs but they're too
old for acid jazz and garage and
ambient and all that.  They want to
hear old funk and Stax and New Wave
and Old School Hip Hop and some new
stuff all together and there's nowhere
for them."
1017,CAROLINE,1017,"And the new label?  And the Kinky
Wizards?"
1018,ROB,1018,"Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are --
you know what?  Why don't I just
make you a tape?"
1019,CAROLINE,1019,"Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could
have deejay Rob Gordon play in my
own home."
1020,ROB,1020,"Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I
love making tapes."
1021,ROB,1021,"A good compilation tape, like breaking
up, is hard to do and takes ages
longer than it might seem.  You gotta
kick off with a killer, to hold the
attention.  Then you have to take it
up a notch, but not blow your wad,
so maybe cool it off a notch, and
you can't put the same artist twice
on the tape, except if some subtle
point or lesson or theme involved,
and even then not the two of them in
a row, and you can't woo somebody
with Joni Mitchell's ""Big Yellow
Taxi"" and then bash their head off
with something like GBH's ""City Baby
Attacked by Rats,"" and... oh, there
are a lot of rules.  Anyway, I worked
hard at this one."
1022,LAURA,1022,Who's that for?
1023,ROB,1023,"This?  Oh, just that woman who
interviewed me for The Reader.  Carol?
Caroline?  Something like that."
1024,ROB,1024,"Hi, Caroline... Oh, it's Rob.  Yeah,
listen, I have a new list for you
and -- Oh.  Yes.  Of course...  Well
maybe next week they could print a,
uh, retraction.  Or a correction.
Because the list I have now it really
much more -- right.  Okay.  Anyway,
I have your tape.  That's right.
Shall I mail it to you?  Or... would
you like to have a drink?"
1025,ROB,1025,"How are you not going to fall for
someone who wants to interview you?
Now Caroline is all I can think about.
And in the daydreams I imagine every
detail, the entire story of our future
relationship, until suddenly I realize
that there's nothing left to actually,
like, happen.  I've done it all,
lived through it all in my head.  I
know the whole plot, the ending, and
the good parts.  Now I'd have to
watch it all over again in real time,
and where's the fun in that?  And
fucking--when is it all going to
stop?  Am I going to jump from rock
to rock for the rest of my life until
there aren't any rocks left?  Am I
going to bolt every time I get itchy
feet?  Because I get them about once
a quarter, along with the store's
tax bill.  I've been thinking with
my guts since I was fourteen years
old and, frankly speaking, I've come
to the conclusion that my guts have
shit for brains.  You know what's
wrong with Laura, what my problem
is?  What's wrong with Laura is that
I'll never see her for the first or
second or third time.  That's all.
Fuck it.  I'll probably mail the
tape.  Probably."
1026,LAURA,1026,"A drinking lunch on a school day.
What a nice surprise."
1027,LAURA,1027,Are you worried about tomorrow night?
1028,ROB,1028,Not really.
1029,LAURA,1029,"Are you going to talk to me, or shall
I get my paper out?"
1030,ROB,1030,I'm going to talk to you.
1031,LAURA,1031,Right.
1032,LAURA,1032,"What are you going to talk to me
about?"
1033,ROB,1033,"I'm going to talk to you about whether
you want to get married or not.  To
me."
1034,LAURA,1034,Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
1035,ROB,1035,I mean it.
1036,LAURA,1036,I know.
1037,ROB,1037,"Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch."
1038,LAURA,1038,"I'm sorry.  But two days ago you
were in love with that girl who
interviewed you for The Reader,
weren't you?"
1039,ROB,1039,"Not in love, exactly, but..."
1040,LAURA,1040,"Well forgive me if I don't think of
you as the world's safest bet."
1041,ROB,1041,Would you marry me if I was?
1042,LAURA,1042,No.  Probably not.
1043,ROB,1043,"Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?"
1044,LAURA,1044,"Don't sulk.  What brought all this
on?"
1045,ROB,1045,I don't know.
1046,LAURA,1046,Very persuasive.
1047,ROB,1047,Are you persuadable?
1048,LAURA,1048,"No.  I don't think so.  I'm just
curious about how one goes from making
tapes for one person to marriage
proposals to another in two days.
Fair enough?"
1049,ROB,1049,Fair enough.
1050,LAURA,1050,So?
1051,ROB,1051,"I'm just sick of thinking about it
all the time."
1052,LAURA,1052,About what?
1053,ROB,1053,"This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I
want to think about something else."
1054,LAURA,1054,"I've changed my mind.  That's the
most romantic thing I've ever heard.
I do.  I will."
1055,ROB,1055,Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
1056,LAURA,1056,"I mean, maybe you're right.  But
were you really expecting me to say
yes?"
1057,ROB,1057,"I dunno.  Didn't think about it,
really.  It was the asking that was
the important thing."
1058,LAURA,1058,"Well, you've asked."
1059,LAURA,1059,Thank you.
1060,ROB,1060,"Uh, thanks for uh, coming out tonight.
I hope you have a good time.  And I
hope you like the record.  The one
by the Kinky Wizards.  The record
that we're having this record release
party for."
1061,ROB,1061,"Thanks.  Listen to it first, though."
1062,ROB,1062,"Okay.  We'll get to that later.
Right now, I'd like to introduce..."
1063,ROB,1063,Sonic Death Monkey.
1064,ROB,1064,"I'm an idiot.  I should have played
the record first.  This place is
about to get burned down."
1065,LAURA,1065,"It's gonna be fine.  These people
are ready for anything."
1066,BARRY,1066,"Yeah, well..."
1067,BARRY,1067,"Thanks for the enthusiastic intro,
Rob.  We're not called Sonic Death
Monkey anymore, though, ladies and
gentlemen.  We might be on the verge
of becoming the Atavistics, but we
haven't decided yet.  But tonight,
we are... BARRY JIVE AND THE UPTOWN
FIVE!  ONE TWO THREE --And they launch
into Marvin Gaye's ""Got To Give It
Up,"" almost flawlessly faithful to
the original.  Barry is transformed --
shuffling footwork, a wide smile,
and when the intro winds up, an almost
perfect falsetto.  The crowd goes
nuts, filling the floor.  Rob is
stunned, begins to smile.  Laura
takes his hand and leads him out
into the crowd..."
