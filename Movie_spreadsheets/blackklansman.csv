Vietnam War?
RON STALLWORTH
I went to College."

11,1088,MR. TURRENTINE,11,"MR. TURRENTINE (CONT'D)
There's never been a Black Cop in
this City. If we make you an Officer,
you would, in effect, be the Jackie
Robinson of the Colorado Springs
Police force."
12,1089,MR. TURRENTINE,12,"MR. TURRENTINE (CONT'D)
And if you know anything about Jackie
Robinson you know he had to take a
lot of... guff... from his fellow
Teammates, from Fans, other Teams,
and The Press.
RON STALLWORTH
I know Jackie's Story, Sir."
13,1090,MR. TURRENTINE,13,"Good. So, knowing that, when someone
calls you Nigger will you be able to
turn the other Cheek?"
14,1091,MR. TURRENTINE,14,"RON STALLWORTH
If I need to, yes, Sir."
15,1092,MR. TURRENTINE,15,"Son, The Mayor and I think you might

Truth be told when I see one of your

Stomach.
RON STALLWORTH
Yeah. Why's that?

RON STALLWORTH
What would that be?
OFFICER MULANEY

Security of these United States. This
Carmichael Joker, former Panther or
not, they say he's a Damn Good

Have you heard Brother Kwame speak
before?"
66,1143,RON STALLWORTH,66,Who?
67,1144,PATRICE,67,Kwame Ture.
68,1145,RON STALLWORTH,68,"Actually, I haven't, I didn't know he
changed his name."
69,1146,PATRICE,69,"Yes, after he moved to Africa. He
took the names of Kwame Nkrumah of
Ghana and his Mentor Sekou Toure of
Guinea to honor The Great Leaders."
70,1147,RON STALLWORTH,70,"That's Heavy. Do you know how he got
to Colorado Springs?"
71,1148,PATRICE,71,"The Colorado College Black Student
Union invited Brother Ture."
72,1149,RON STALLWORTH,72,"I can dig it. I can dig it. You with
The Black Student Union?"

Thank you..."

...I'm here to tell you this evening
it is time for you to stop running
away from being Black. You are
College Students, you should think.
KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
It is time for you to understand that
you as The growing Intellectuals of
this Country, you must define Beauty
for Black People, Now that's Black
Power.
BLACK MASS
BLACK POWER!!! BLACK POWER!!!"
79,1156,KWAME TURE,79,"Is Beauty defined by someone with a
Narrow Nose? Thin Lips? White Skin?
You ain't got none of that. If your
Lips are Thick, Bite them in. Hold
your Nose! Don't drink Coffee because
it makes you Black!"
80,1157,KWAME TURE,80,"KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
Your Nose is Boss, your Lips are
Thick, your skin is Black, you are
Black and you are Beautiful!"
81,1158,KWAME TURE,81,"KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
We want to be like The White people
that oppress us in this Country and
since they hate us, we hate
ourselves. You dig Tarzan? I remember
that when I was a Boy I used to go
see Tarzan Movies on Saturdays. I
loved me some Jane too. Jane was A
Fine White Woman. White Tarzan used
to Beat up The Black Natives. I would
sit there yelling ""Kill The Beasts,
Kill The Savages, Kill 'Em!"" Actually
I was saying: ""Kill Me."" It was as if
a Jewish Boy watched Nazis taking
Jews off to Concentration Camps and
cheered them on. Today, I want The
Chief to beat The Hell out of Tarzan
and send him back to The Caves of
Europe. But it takes time to become
Free of The Lies and their shaming
effect on Black Minds. It takes time
to reject the most Important Lie:
that Black People inherently can't do
the same things White People can do
unless White People help them."
82,1159,RON STALLWORTH,82,Right on!!! Right On!!!
83,1160,RON STALLWORTH,83,"KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
If a White Man wants to Lynch Me,
that's his Problem. If he's got The
Power to Lynch Me, that's My Problem.
Racism is not a question of Attitude;
it's a question of Power."
84,1161,RON STALLWORTH,84,"KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
The vast majority of Negroes in this
Country live in Captive Communities
and must endure their conditions of
Oppression because and only because
they are Black and Powerless. Now We
are being shot down like Dogs in the
streets by White Racist Police. We
can no longer accept this Oppression
without retribution. The War in
Vietnam is Illegal and Immoral. I'd
rather see a Brother Kill a Cop than
Kill a Vietnamese. At least he's got
a reason for Killing The Cop. When
you Kill a Vietnamese you're a Hero
and you don't even know why you
Killed him. At least if you Kill a
Cop you're doing it for a reason."
85,1162,KWAME TURE (CONT'D),85,The BLACK MASS STANDS AS ONE WITH KWAME TURE.
86,1163,KWAME TURE AND BLACK MASS,86,"Caught up in the moment, Ron gathers himself, as if
remembering why he is here. Kwame takes Patrice's Hand and
raises it in Celebration and Unity!"
87,1164,KWAME TURE AND BLACK MASS,87,"Ron moves down the Greeting Line for Kwame. He watches as
Patrice stands near him. Kwame pulls her in close, whispers
something in her ear. She smiles, a bit smitten.
Ron watches as he finally reaches Kwame, shaking his hand."
88,1165,RON STALLWORTH,88,"Flip and Jimmy wearing Headphones listening react to ear-
splitting Audio feedback."
89,1166,RON STALLWORTH,89,"Ron stands mid-grip with Kwame. Nerves pinballing. Kwame
lowers his voice, looking around conspiratorially."
90,1167,KWAME TURE,90,Kwame pulls back. Returns to his normal speaking voice.
91,1168,KWAME TURE (CONT'D),91,"Ron is waiting outside as Patrice steps out, followed by
Odetta and Hakeem. Ron nears her."

93,1170,RON STALLWORTH,93,"Black folks are dancing, getting down. At the bar, Ron looks
at his watch having been there a while. He finishes his Rum

Patrice. He decides to call it a Night, stepping off his
stool, paying his Tab to BRO POPE, The Bartender when..."
94,1171,PATRICE,94,"Patrice is right there near him. She flops down on the Bar
stool, exhausted, and lights up a Kool Cigarette."

thing was so frightening... I didn't."
112,1189,RON STALLWORTH,112,I'm sorry.
113,1190,CHIEF BRIDGES,113,What was the Room like?
114,1191,RON STALLWORTH,114,Folks were hanging on every word.
115,1192,CHIEF BRIDGES,115,"Sounds like he had them pretty riled
up?"
116,1193,RON STALLWORTH,116,"But I'm not sure that means Black
Folks were ready to start a
Revolution."
117,1194,CHIEF BRIDGES,117,What makes you think that?
118,1195,RON STALLWORTH,118,"Nobody was talking about that. That
wasn't the Mood. Everybody was Cool."
119,1196,CHIEF BRIDGES,119,"So let me get this straight. He told
a Crowd of ""Black Folks"" to get ready
for a Race War. That they were going
to have to arm themselves and kill
Cops. What about that?"
120,1197,RON STALLWORTH,120,"Yeah, he said that but I think that
was just talk. You know, Rhetoric."
121,1198,FLIP,121,That's what I thought too.

Colorado Springs."

124,1201,CHIEF BRIDGES,124,What?
125,1202,RON STALLWORTH,125,"He changed his name from Stokely
Carmichael to Kwame Ture."
126,1203,CHIEF BRIDGES,126,"I don't care if he changed his name
to Muhammad Ali, he's still
dangerous."

me about how the CSPD pulled over her
and Ture?"

166,1243,RON STALLWORTH,166,"SGT. TRAPP
We'd have to go to Narcotics. Meaning
we'd have to deal with Bridges."

seems you can spare them."
170,1247,CHIEF BRIDGES,170,"Sgt. Trapp, Ron spoke to the Man on

difference."

talk for myself, Thank You. How
exactly does a Black Man talk?"

Investigation?"
179,1256,RON STALLWORTH,179,"I have established contact and
created some familiarity with The

continue that role but another
Officer, a White Officer, will play
Me when they meet Face to Face."
180,1257,CHIEF BRIDGES,180,...My Point Exactly!!!...
181,1258,RON STALLWORTH,181,"Black Ron Stallworth on The phone and
White Ron Stallworth Face to Face, so
there becomes a combined Ron

White Man."
184,1261,CHIEF BRIDGES,184,"If anything happens to my Man there
won't be Two Ron Stallworths.
There'll be none."
185,1262,FLIP,185,You're late.
186,1263,RON STALLWORTH,186,I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
187,1264,JIMMY,187,I heard that somewhere before.
188,1265,FLIP,188,"Hey, Jimmy when's the last time they
let a Rookie head up an
Investigation. Oh that's right,
NEVER."
189,1266,FLIP,189,"... Ron Stallworth. I do Wholesale
Manufacturing."
190,1267,RON STALLWORTH,190,Whereabout?
191,1268,FLIP,191,Pueblo.
192,1269,JIMMY,192,What's that commute like?
193,1270,FLIP,193,"Jimmy, I'm glad you asked, straight-
shot down I-25. Hour tops."
194,1271,JIMMY,194,Long ride.
195,1272,FLIP,195,What do we listen to?
196,1273,RON STALLWORTH,196,"KWYD. Christian Talk in The Morning,
although the Signal starts to cut out
near Pueblo. On the way back I go for
102.7 to get my Allman Brothers Fix.
Only I have to change every time that
British Fag David Bowie pipes on."
197,1274,JIMMY,197,I love Bowie.
198,1275,RON STALLWORTH,198,"Remember you've got to retain the
details of what you share with them
so I can be White Ron Stallworth."
199,1276,FLIP,199,"Jimmy, I always wanted to grow up to
be Black, all my Heroes were Black
Guys. Willie Mays..."
200,1277,JIMMY,200,Basket catch.
201,1278,FLIP,201,Wilt The Stilt...
202,1279,JIMMY,202,A record hundred points in the game.
203,1280,RON STALLWORTH,203,"Jimmy, join us."
204,1281,"RON STALLWORTH, FLIP AND JIMMY",204,"Say it loud. I'm Black and I'm proud.
Say it loud. I'm Black and I'm proud."
205,1282,JIMMY,205,"Don't forget to lose that Star of
David around your neck."
206,1283,RON STALLWORTH,206,You're Jewish?
207,1284,RON STALLWORTH,207,It's Walter.
208,1285,FELIX,208,Ron Stallworth?
209,1286,FLIP,209,That's me. And you must be Walter.
210,1287,FELIX,210,Name's Felix.
211,1288,FLIP,211,"I was told I'd be meeting with Walter
Breachway."
212,1289,FELIX,212,"Change of plans, Mack. I'm gonna need
you to hop in The Pickup."
213,1290,FLIP,213,"Okay, well how about I just follow
you..."
214,1291,FELIX,214,"...No Can Do. You come with me.
Security."
215,1292,FELIX,215,"You for The White Race, Ron?"
216,1293,FLIP,216,"Hell Yeah!!! Been having some trouble
lately with these Local Niggers."
217,1294,FELIX,217,"Since The Civil War it's always
trouble with Niggers.
Walter said something about your
Sister?"
218,1295,FLIP,218,Makes me Sick.
219,1296,FLIP,219,"But it's also the, like, camaraderie
I'm looking for...with The Klan."
220,1297,FELIX,220,Da Fuck did you say?
221,1298,FLIP,221,Camaraderie...?
222,1299,FELIX,222,No. The other word.
223,1300,FLIP,223,The Klan...?
224,1301,FELIX,224,"...Not ""The Klan."" It's The
Organization. The Invisible Empire
has managed to stay Invisible for a
reason. Do Not Ever Use That Word.
You understand?"
225,1302,FLIP,225,"I overstand... Right. The
Organization."
226,1303,FELIX,226,"Check this Shit out... you're never
gonna believe it."
227,1304,FLIP,227,What?
228,1305,FELIX,228,There's a Jig on our Bumper.
229,1306,JIMMY,229,He sees us. Back Off.
230,1307,FELIX,230,"Let's be ready, case we gotta go and
shoot us A Alabama Porch Monkey."
231,1308,FELIX (CONT'D),231,Look under your seat. Pull it out.
232,1309,FLIP,232,Pull out what?
233,1310,FELIX,233,Under the seat!!!
234,1311,FELIX (CONT'D),234,Load 'er up. One in The Chamber.
235,1312,FELIX (CONT'D),235,Load it!!!
236,1313,FLIP,236,Ready to go.
237,1314,FELIX,237,"That's right, Porch Monkey. Don't be
Messin' with us..."
238,1315,FLIP,238,...The Organization.
239,1316,FELIX,239,"Not so fast, Buddy Boy."
240,1317,RON STALLWORTH,240,Just a Bar.
241,1318,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),241,Think he got a good look at My Face?
242,1319,JIMMY,242,Probably.
243,1320,WALTER,243,"Ron. Glad you could make it. Walter
Breachway, Chapter President."
244,1321,FLIP,244,I appreciate you inviting me out.
245,1322,WALTER,245,"I've been impressed with our phone
conversations. I feel you have some
fine ideas that could help The Cause."
246,1323,FLIP,246,I meant every word I said.
247,1324,WALTER,247,How 'bout some pool?
248,1325,WALTER (CONT'D),248,"I've had my own share of Run-Ins with
Niggers. Matter of fact, it's part of
what led me to The Organization."
249,1326,FLIP,249,That right?
250,1327,WALTER,250,"It became my salvation. After I was
shot and wounded by some Niggers. My
Wife... Savagely Raped by a whole
Pack of 'EM, and not a one went to
Jail."
251,1328,JIMMY,251,Never happened.
252,1329,WALTER,252,"They're taking over. That's all you
see on the TV Anymore. Niggers.
Niggers selling Soap, Niggers selling
Automobiles, Niggers selling
Toothpaste, Niggers, Niggers,
Niggers."
253,1330,IVANHOE,253,"Wasn't long ago them Sumbitches
wasn't on no TV."
254,1331,WALTER,254,"You forgetting Uncle Ben and Aunt
Jemima."
255,1332,IVANHOE,255,"Dang!!! You know, I gotta say I kinda
like dem' Niggers...Rice and
Pancakes."
256,1333,IVANHOE (CONT'D),256,"Name's Ivanhoe, by the way."
257,1334,RON STALLWORTH,257,"Mad at Sanford and Son and Flip
Wilson."
258,1335,WALTER,258,"All you get now is how we gotta'
cater to them. We gotta' get us some
""Minorities"". Watch ya' mouth, don't
say this, don't say that, be nice,
they're not Colored..."
259,1336,FELIX,259,Negros...
260,1337,IVANHOE,260,...Blacks...
261,1338,WALTER,261,...Afro-Americans...
262,1339,FLIP,262,"...FUCK. How 'bout just Fuckin'?
Niggers. Make it Fuckin' simple.
ALL
NIGGERS!!!"
263,1340,FLIP,263,I been saying this stuff for years.
264,1341,FELIX,264,You ain't the only one.
265,1342,FLIP,265,"You don't know how good it is to hear
someone that gets it."
266,1343,FLIP (CONT'D),266,What kinda stuff you Guys do?
267,1344,IVANHOE,267,"You know, Cross burnings. Marches and
stuff so people don't Fuck wit' us."
268,1345,FLIP,268,I'm tired of people Fuckin' with me.
269,1346,WALTER,269,"You come to the right place cuz'
Nobody Fucks with us. How much you
know about The History?"
270,1347,FLIP,270,Some...I could know more.
271,1348,WALTER,271,We'll teach you.
272,1349,IVANHOE,272,This year's gonna be big for us.
273,1350,FLIP,273,How so?
274,1351,IVANHOE,274,"BOOM!!! We're gonna make Fireworks,
yes we are..."
275,1352,WALTER,275,"...Ivanhoe talking nonsense again.
Kid can't hold his Beer fer Shit. The
Organization is strictly Non-
Violent..."
276,1353,IVANHOE,276,"...Like dat Dead Nigger Martin Luther
Coon."
277,1354,FLIP,277,Gotcha.
278,1355,WALTER,278,"Say, Ron? Mind coming with me?"
279,1356,FLIP,279,Where to?
280,1357,FELIX,280,"You Undercover or something? You ask
too many questions. Let's GO!!!"
281,1358,JIMMY,281,Where they going?
282,1359,RON STALLWORTH,282,Lost the damn signal.
283,1360,WALTER,283,Congrats you passed The Mustard.
284,1361,WALTER (CONT'D),284,"Thought we'd get the Membership
process started."
285,1362,FLIP,285,Now we're talkin'.
286,1363,WALTER,286,"Fill these out and Mail 'em to The
National Headquarters. Once they send
your Membership Card, you'll be able
to participate in our Programs."
287,1364,FLIP,287,Alcoa Can't wait.
288,1365,IVANHOE,288,I like those Commercials.
289,1366,WALTER,289,"Imperial Tax to become a Member: Ten
Dollars for The Year. Fifteen Dollar
Chapter Fee. Robes and Hoods not
included, that's Extra."
290,1367,FELIX,290,Fuckin' Inflation.
291,1368,FLIP,291,I can't thank you Brothers enough.
292,1369,WALTER,292,"Pleasure, is all ours."
293,1370,WALTER (CONT'D),293,I'll take you back to your Car.
294,1371,FELIX,294,"You're not a Jew, right?"
295,1372,FLIP,295,You trying to offend me?
296,1373,FELIX,296,It's Protocol.
297,1374,FLIP,297,'Course I'm no Stinkin' Kike.
298,1375,WALTER,298,"We gotta ask it, is all. I'm
satisfied. How about you Guys?"
299,1376,FELIX,299,Smells Kosher to me.
300,1377,FLIP,300,Stop fuckin' 'round.
301,1378,WALTER,301,"Felix, cut it out."
302,1379,FLIP,302,"You have me dressed like one of
the Beverly Hillbillies for
Chrissakes. I felt too Redneck for
those Guys."
303,1380,RON STALLWORTH,303,They liked you.
304,1381,FLIP,304,"Except for that Felix Guy. Do not
ride his Bumper like that! Two car
lengths!"
305,1382,RON STALLWORTH,305,"You got The Papers? They want you to
join."
306,1383,FLIP,306,Technically they want you to join.
307,1384,RON STALLWORTH,307,"They want a Black Man to join The Ku
Klux Klan. I'd call that Mission
Impossible. Double Success."
308,1385,SGT. TRAPP,308,"And exactly how much should we be
worrying about them?"
309,1386,RON STALLWORTH,309,"Enough that we'd like to dig deeper.
One of the Men discussed plans for a
possible Attack..."
310,1387,FLIP,310,"...I wouldn't give him that much
credit. These Yahoos like to Boast."
311,1388,SGT. TRAPP,311,What kind of Attack?
312,1389,FLIP,312,"Ivanhoe said ""BOOM"", mentioned
something about Fireworks.
Personally, I didn't buy it. Doubt
they're even capable."
313,1390,RON STALLWORTH,313,"Either way, we're looking for full
support from The Department."
314,1391,SGT. TRAPP,314,"We're moving on with the
Investigation."
315,1392,PATRICE,315,"The next day when we dropped Brother
Kwame off at the Airport he told me
The Black Power Movement needed
Strong Sistah's like me to lead the
fight against Capitalist oppression
and The Politicians and Pigs who
perpetuate it. His words almost made
that whole Pig Nightmare worth
while..."
316,1393,PATRICE (CONT'D),316,...What's wrong?
317,1394,RON STALLWORTH,317,I don't really use that word.
318,1395,PATRICE,318,What word?
319,1396,RON STALLWORTH,319,Pigs.
320,1397,PATRICE,320,What else would you call them?
321,1398,RON STALLWORTH,321,Cops... Police...
322,1399,PATRICE,322,Bunch of Racist Cops on a Power Trip.
323,1400,RON STALLWORTH,323,So you think all Cops are Racist?
324,1401,PATRICE,324,"It only takes One to pull a Trigger
on a Innocent Sister or Brother."
325,1402,PATRICE (CONT'D),325,"Why were you at Brother Kwame's
Speech?"
326,1403,RON STALLWORTH,326,"He's got some good ideas. I don't
agree with all of them but he's a
smart Brother who's worth hearing."
327,1404,PATRICE,327,"Are you Down for The Liberation of
Black People?"
328,1405,RON STALLWORTH,328,"Do we always have to talk about
Politics?"
329,1406,PATRICE,329,What's more important?
330,1407,RON STALLWORTH,330,"Do you ever take any time off from
The Liberation of Black People?"
331,1408,PATRICE,331,NO!!! It's a Lifetime JOB!!!
332,1409,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),332,"Sista Angela Davis, can we spend some
quality time together."
333,1410,PATRICE,333,And what did you say your J-O-B is?
334,1411,RON STALLWORTH,334,"Kathleen Cleaver, I didn't?"
335,1412,PATRICE,335,Are You A Pig?
336,1413,RON STALLWORTH,336,You mean A Cop?
337,1414,PATRICE,337,You A Cop?
338,1415,RON STALLWORTH,338,"NO I'm a Black Man who wants to get
to know A Strong, Intelligent,
Beautiful Sister."
339,1416,RON STALLWORTH,339,"This is Ron.
WALTER (O.S.)
This is Walter. Is this Ron? Your
Voice sounds different over The
Phone."
340,1417,RON STALLWORTH,340,Allergies acting up again.
341,1418,RON STALLWORTH,341,"WALTER (O.S.)
...Yeah, I get that all the time."
342,1419,RON STALLWORTH,342,"WALTER (O.S.)(CONT'D)
Well, just thought I'd say it was
great having you swing by. The
Brothers really took a liking to you."
343,1420,RON STALLWORTH,343,I'm honored.
344,1421,WALTER (O.S.),344,"Why don't you come by Felix's this
Saturday? Meet the rest of The
Brotherhood."
345,1422,CONNIE,345,"Ron! So nice to meet you. I'm Connie,
Felix's Wife."
346,1423,FLIP,346,Great to meet you.
347,1424,CONNIE,347,"The Boys are in the Backyard.

348,1425,CONNIE,348,"Sorry to interrupt. I have some
Cheese Dip and Crackers."
349,1426,FELIX,349,"Make 'em remember who We Are and What
We Stand For. We are The
Organization."
350,1427,CONNIE,350,"I read in The Gazette some Nigger
named Carmichael held a Rally and
there's some College Nigger Girl with
the ""Baboon Student Union"" attacking
Our Police. This Girl is Dangerous.
Reminds me of that Commie Angela
Davis. We need to shut her damn
mouth."
351,1428,CONNIE,351,"CONNIE (CONT'D)
Here, I clipped the Article."
352,1429,FELIX,352,That'll be all. Love you Sweetie.
353,1430,CONNIE,353,"One of these days you're going to
need me to do something for you. Wait
and See."
354,1431,WALTER,354,"How 'bout We focus on our Bread and
Butter. The Next Cross Burning.
Which, Flip, you'll be lucky enough
to participate in if your Membership
Card comes soon enough..."
355,1432,FLIP,355,"...That'd be a tremendous Honor.
Where?"
356,1433,WALTER,356,The Highest Hills get the most Eyes.
357,1434,FELIX,357,"Hey Ron, I gotta show you something."
358,1435,FELIX (CONT'D),358,Looka here.
359,1436,FLIP,359,Wow. This is really... something.
360,1437,FELIX,360,Here's my favorite. Twelve Gauge.
361,1438,FELIX (CONT'D),361,I call this...The Jew Killer.
362,1439,FLIP,362,That's a Remington Model 1900.
363,1440,FELIX,363,Indeed it is.
364,1441,WALTER (O.S.),364,"Almost done in here? We still have
some items on The Agenda..."
365,1442,FELIX,365,"No, you're going to take this Lie
Detector test."
366,1443,RON STALLWORTH,366,Shit.
367,1444,WALTER (O.S.),367,"Open up, Felix! Enough is Enough!!!"
368,1445,FELIX,368,Lower your Arm right here.
369,1446,FLIP,369,"Felix, this is lame bullshit."
370,1447,FELIX,370,"Lame or not you're taking this Jew
Lie Detector Test."
371,1448,FLIP,371,"Out of respect, I'm gonna play along
with your Get Smart Bullshit, but I'm
No Fuckin' Jew!!!"
372,1449,FELIX,372,Siddown.
373,1450,FELIX,373,"Ask anybody, they'll say I'm a real
Friendly Guy. Thing is, I'm only
Friendly to my Friends, not JEW
Friendly, Damn Sure not Nigger
Friendly."
374,1451,WALTER   (O.S.),374,Let me in!
375,1452,FELIX,375,"Let's warm up. What is the surname of
your Biological Father?"
376,1453,FLIP,376,Stallworth.
377,1454,FELIX,377,Let me see your Dick.
378,1455,FLIP,378,You like pretty Dicks Felix?
379,1456,FELIX,379,"I hear you Jews do something Funny
with ya Dicks. Some weird Jew Shit.
Is your Dick circumstanced?"
380,1457,FLIP,380,"You tryin' to suck my Jew Dick?
Faggot."
381,1458,FELIX,381,"Who you callin' a Faggot, Jew?"
382,1459,FELIX,382,Y'know what I think?
383,1460,FLIP,383,You think?
384,1461,FELIX,384,I think a lot.
385,1462,FLIP,385,What do you think about?
386,1463,CONNIE,386,"There's a Fuckin' Black Lawn Jockey

391,1468,SGT. TRAPP,391,"Lie Detector? Shots Fired? A Goddamn
ClusterFuck!!! You Dickheads are
putting me in a Tough Spot here. If
Bridges heard about this..."
392,1469,RON STALLWORTH,392,"Is he gonna hear about it, Sarge?"
393,1470,FLIP,393,"I didn't say it in there with Trapp
but that Peckerwood had a Gun in my
Face and he was an Ass Hair away from
pulling The Trigger."
394,1471,RON STALLWORTH,394,And he didn't.
395,1472,FLIP,395,"But he could have and then I woulda
been Dead... for what? Stoppin' some
Jerkoffs from playing Dress up?"
396,1473,RON STALLWORTH,396,"Flip, it's Intel."
397,1474,FLIP,397,"I'm not risking my Life to prevent
some Rednecks from lighting a couple
Sticks on Fire."
398,1475,RON STALLWORTH,398,This is the Job. What's your problem?
399,1476,FLIP,399,"Ron, you're my problem."
400,1477,RON STALLWORTH,400,How's that?
401,1478,FLIP,401,"For you it's not a job, it's a
Crusade. It's not personal nor should
it be."
402,1479,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),402,"You're passing, Man."
403,1480,FLIP,403,What?
404,1481,RON STALLWORTH,404,"You're passing for a WASP!!! White
Anglo Saxon Protestant, All-American
Hot Dog, Cherry Pie White Boy. It's
what some Light-Skinned Black Folks
do, they pass for White."
405,1482,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),405,"Doesn't that Hatred The Klan say Piss
you off."
406,1483,FLIP,406,Of course it does.
407,1484,RON STALLWORTH,407,"Then why you acting like you ain't
got skin in the Game!"
408,1485,FLIP,408,That's my Damn Business!
409,1486,RON STALLWORTH,409,It's our Business.
410,1487,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),410,"I'm gonna get your Membership Card so
you can go on this Cross Burning and

Are there any other kind?"
420,1497,RON STALLWORTH,420,"DEVIN DAVIS
And I'm just happy to be talking to a
True White American."
421,1498,RON STALLWORTH,421,"Amen, Mr. Davis. Seems like there's
less and less of us these days.
Now about that Membership Card..."
422,1499,RON STALLWORTH,422,"DEVIN DAVIS
...I understand the situation. We've
been having some Administrative
problems that have caused a backlog.
...Tell you what, Ron. I'll see to it
personally that your Membership Card
is processed and sent out today.
RON
Thank you, Mr. Davis. I can't express
to you how much I appreciate this.
DEVIN DAVIS
The pleasure is all mine. I look
forward to meeting you in person One
Day and God Bless White America."
423,1500,LANDERS,423,"Watch where you're going. You could
get hurt like that Hot Shot."
424,1501,RON STALLWORTH,424,"That Cop that pulled Kwame Ture over
that night... was it Landers?"
425,1502,FLIP,425,How'd you know?
426,1503,RON STALLWORTH,426,I can smell em' a Mile away now.
427,1504,FLIP,427,He's been a Bad Cop for a long time.
428,1505,RON STALLWORTH,428,Yeah?
429,1506,FLIP,429,"Does that kinda' Shit all the time.
Few years ago, he allegedly Shot and
Killed a Black Kid... he said he had
a Gun. The Kid wasn't the type."
430,1507,RON STALLWORTH,430,"Flip, why do you tolerate this?"
431,1508,FLIP,431,"We're a family. Good or Bad. We stick
together. You wanna be the Guy that
Rats him out?"
432,1509,FLIP (CONT'D),432,"You're New. You're a Rookie. You ever
get your Ass in a Jam, you'll
appreciate The Blue Wall of Silence."
433,1510,RON STALLWORTH,433,"Yeah, reminds me of another Group."
434,1511,FLIP,434,Gezzus H. Christ!
435,1512,FELIX,435,"Helps with practicin' for Nigger
Looters. Dem' Sum-bitches Run like
Roaches when you Flip the switch in
the Kitchen late at Night."
436,1513,FELIX (CONT'D),436,"I don't know how that Black Bastard
got away the other day."
437,1514,IVANHOE,437,"Hey, Ron! Take my Forty-Five Auto
wanna see what you can do."
438,1515,FELIX,438,"Maybe you'll get dat Nigger next
time."
439,1516,FELIX,439,"KLANSMEN
Good Shot!!! Shit! Got that Coon Dead
in The Ass! Nice One!!!"
440,1517,IVANHOE,440,That's one deaaaaaad Jungle Bunny!!!
441,1518,FELIX,441,Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
442,1519,FLIP,442,"My Ole Man gave me a Toy Cap Gun when
I was a Kid, been shooting ever
since."
443,1520,RON STALLWORTH,443,Bernie Casey's a Badd Brother.
444,1521,PATRICE,444,"Cleopatra Jones was the one. It's
about time We see a strong Sister
like that..."
445,1522,RON STALLWORTH,445,...And Tamara Dobson played a Cop.
446,1523,PATRICE,446,"That was a Black Exploitation Movie.
A fantasy. Real life's not like that.
In real life there's no Cleopatra
Jones or Coffy."
447,1524,RON STALLWORTH,447,"You don't dig Pam Grier? She's Fine
as Wine and twice as Mellow."
448,1525,PATRICE,448,"Pam Grier is doing her Thing but in
real life it's just Pigs killing
Black Folks."
449,1526,RON STALLWORTH,449,"What if a Cop was trying to make
things better."
450,1527,PATRICE,450,From the inside?
451,1528,RON STALLWORTH,451,"Yeah, from the inside."
452,1529,PATRICE,452,"You can't make things better from the
inside. It's a Racist System."
453,1530,RON STALLWORTH,453,So just give up?
454,1531,PATRICE,454,"No!!! We fight for what Black People
really need! BLACK LIBERATION!!!"
455,1532,RON STALLWORTH,455,Can't you do that from the inside!
456,1533,PATRICE,456,"No! You can't. White Man won't let
us."
457,1534,PATRICE (CONT'D),457,"What did Dubois say about ""Double
Consciousness""? ""Twoness"". Being an
American and a Negro? Two Souls? Two
Thoughts? Two warring ideals in one
Dark Body?"
458,1535,RON STALLWORTH,458,"I know how that feels. I'm Two damn
people all the time!"
459,1536,PATRICE,459,"But you shouldn't be! We shouldn't
have a War going on inside ourselves.
Why can't we just be Black People?"
460,1537,RON STALLWORTH,460,Because we're not there yet!
461,1538,PATRICE,461,"Well, I'm tired of waiting!"
462,1539,RON STALLWORTH,462,Shaft or Superfly?
463,1540,PATRICE,463,What?
464,1541,RON STALLWORTH,464,"Pick one, Shaft or Superfly?"
465,1542,PATRICE,465,"A Private Detective over a Pimp any
day and twice on Sundays."
466,1543,RON STALLWORTH,466,Richard Roundtree or Ron O'Neal?
467,1544,PATRICE,467,"Richard Roundtree. Pimps Ain't No
Heroes."
468,1545,RON STALLWORTH,468,"Ron O'Neal isn't a Pimp. He's just
playing one."
469,1546,PATRICE,469,That image does damage to Our People.
470,1547,RON STALLWORTH,470,JESUS CHRIST!!! Give it a rest.
471,1548,PATRICE,471,I can't you JIVE TURKEY.
472,1549,FELIX,472,Wrong address.
473,1550,PATRICE,473,Who was that?
474,1551,RON STALLWORTH,474,Nobody.
475,1552,FLIP,475,"Hey, sorry had to work late. How you
guys doing?"
476,1553,FELIX,476,You got a Twin.
477,1554,FLIP,477,What?
478,1555,FELIX,478,You got a Twin.
479,1556,FLIP,479,Twin what?
480,1557,FELIX,480,A Twin-Twin and ya Twin is a NIGGER.
481,1558,FELIX (CONT'D),481,"Looked in the Phone Book and went
over what I thought was your place
and found a Nig there."
482,1559,FLIP,482,My number's unlisted.
483,1560,FLIP (CONT'D),483,What address did you go to?
484,1561,FELIX,484,Over on... Bluestem Lane.
485,1562,FLIP,485,"I don't live on Bluestem. I live off
21st Street..."
486,1563,FELIX,486,So you don't know that Nigger?
487,1564,FLIP,487,"Oh, that's that Nigger I keep in the
woodpile."
488,1565,FLIP (CONT'D),488,"1813 South 21st Street. Come by
sometime we'll have a Coors."
489,1566,FELIX,489,"And y'know what? That loud mouth
Black Student Union Bitch that's been
in the paper complaining about the
Police. She was there."
490,1567,FLIP,490,That Fuckin' Cunt.
491,1568,FELIX,491,"Like to close those Monkey Lips
permanently."
492,1569,FLIP,492,"Yeah, after I get em' 'round da Head
of my Dick."
493,1570,FLIP,493,Are you Fucking kidding me?
494,1571,RON STALLWORTH,494,What?
495,1572,FLIP,495,"You don't cross those lines. This is
about an Investigation. Not a...
Relationship."
496,1573,RON STALLWORTH,496,"You're right, I'm messin' up. Hate to
violate that Blue Wall of Silence."
497,1574,FLIP,497,Nice one.
498,1575,RON STALLWORTH,498,Is Patrice a Target?
499,1576,FLIP,499,Maybe.
500,1577,RON STALLWORTH,500,"We got Active Duty Soldiers from Fort
Carson. Going to the CID with this."
501,1578,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),501,"Our Mystery Boys Steve and Jerry.
Still don't know who they are."
502,1579,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),502,We got Felix's Old Klan Crew.
503,1580,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),503,And we got new Klan Walter.
504,1581,FLIP,504,"Walter's a General without an Army.
Felix's Crew is stronger than him."
505,1582,FLIP (CONT'D),505,"You've really been talking to Devin
Davis?"
506,1583,RON STALLWORTH,506,Oh Hell yeah!!!
507,1584,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),507,"That's my Ace Boon Coon Running
Partner! And now that you got that
Ronny Boy. We are on a Roll, Baby!!!"
508,1585,"FLIP
RON STALLWORTH",508,"Member in Good Standing
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan"
509,1586,RON STALLWORTH,509,That's us The Stallworth Boys.
510,1587,FLIP,510,"Yeah, funny, but you didn't have
psychopath staring at you asking
where you lived."
511,1588,RON STALLWORTH,511,"I called to warn you, but you must
have already taken off."
512,1589,FLIP,512,"Ron, I wasn't raised Jewish. It
wasn't a part of my Life. So I never
thought much about being Jewish, was
just another White Kid, didn't even
have my Bar Mitzvah. No Chanukah for
me. Christmas. In this job, you try
to keep things at a distance. You put
up a Shield so you don't feel
anything... This shit is deep. When
that Fuck Felix had me in that room
and I kept having to deny my
heritage...I have been passing.
OMITTED.
OMITTED."
513,1590,PATRICE,513,"I found this one on my Car. But
they're all over The Neighborhood,
too."
514,1591,PATRICE (CONT'D),514,Do you think this is Real?
515,1592,RON STALLWORTH,515,It's Real.
516,1593,PATRICE,516,This is intimidation.
517,1594,RON STALLWORTH,517,"Clearly, this is about the Black
Student Union and you."
518,1595,PATRICE,518,Me?
519,1596,RON STALLWORTH,519,"You've been outspoken about the
incident with the Police when Brother
Kwame was here."
520,1597,PATRICE,520,"So the next time they'll have a
Burning Cross out Front."
521,1598,RON STALLWORTH,521,"They're trying to get to you, like
you said they want to intimidate make
themselves feared. If you don't let
'em scare you. They got nothing. But
keep your eyes open. Be Cool.
ODETTA
That's the problem we've been too
Cool!
HAKEEM
Way too Cool!"
522,1599,RON STALLWORTH,522,"Maybe the both of you should call The
Cops."
523,1600,HAKEEM,523,"How we know this ain't some of the
KKK's Honky-Pig-Partners passing out
this Shit!"
524,1601,IVANHOE,524,"Soak the Wood in Kerosene, we light a
Cig on a pack of matches. Gives us
time to Beat It before The Cross
catches Fire. Safeguard against CSPD."
525,1602,FLIP,525,Must be quite a sight.
526,1603,IVANHOE,526,"The Best. You can see it for Miles.
Freaks out The Jew Media and puts
Niggers on their Nigger Toes."
527,1604,FLIP,527,A lot of these Guys in The Army?
528,1605,IVANHOE,528,"Yeah, even got a few in Active Duty."
529,1606,FLIP,529,Just finished my Second Tour in Nam.
530,1607,IVANHOE,530,Oh yeah? Know anything about C-4?
531,1608,FLIP,531,Enough to make shit BLOW UP.
532,1609,RON STALLWORTH,532,Send another one.
533,1610,IVANHOE,533,"Damn, that's The Second One. Pigs are
out tonight."
534,1611,FELIX,534,That makes Three Piggy Wiggys.
535,1612,RON STALLWORTH,535,"Good job, Men."
536,1613,RON STALLWORTH,536,OFFICE:
537,1614,DEVIN DAVIS,537,"...I don't share this with many
people, but My family had a Colored
Housekeeper growing up. Her name was
Pinky. She was probably the closest
Woman to me other than Mother."
538,1615,RON STALLWORTH,538,That surprises me.
539,1616,DEVIN DAVIS,539,"I know. People think I hate Negroes.
I don't and The Organization doesn't
either."
540,1617,DEVIN DAVIS,540,"They just need to be with their own.
That's what Pinky would say, she had
no problem with Segregation because
she wanted to be with her own kind."
541,1618,RON STALLWORTH,541,Sounds like she was a Mammy to you.
542,1619,DEVIN DAVIS,542,"She was. You ever see ""Gone with the
Wind""? Pinky was my Hattie McDaniel.
She won an Oscar for Best Supporting
Actress."
543,1620,RON STALLWORTH,543,You were Scarlett and she was Mammy.
544,1621,DEVIN DAVIS,544,"That's right. When she passed away it
was like we lost one of the Family."
545,1622,RON STALLWORTH,545,"A good Nigger's funny that way. In
that sense they're like a Dog. They
can get real close to you and when
you lose em'. Just breaks your heart."
546,1623,DEVIN DAVIS,546,Well said Ron.
547,1624,RON STALLWORTH,547,I knew a Nigger once.
548,1625,DEVIN DAVIS,548,Didja?
549,1626,RON STALLWORTH,549,"Yeah. Nigger lived across the street
from us. I must of been Six or Seven.
His nickname was Butter Biscuit."
550,1627,DEVIN DAVIS,550,How'd he get that nickname?
551,1628,RON STALLWORTH,551,He loved his Mama's Butter Biscuits.
552,1629,DEVIN DAVIS,552,Yum Yum!!!
553,1630,RON STALLWORTH,553,"Me and Butter Biscuit played together
everyday. One day My Father came home
early from work and told me I
couldn't play with him anymore
because I was White and Butter
Biscuit was a Nigger."
554,1631,DEVIN DAVIS,554,That's rich.
555,1632,RON STALLWORTH,555,Ain't it.
556,1633,DEVIN DAVIS,556,"Your Father sounds like a Terrific
Man."
557,1634,RON STALLWORTH,557,"Thanks, Buddy."
558,1635,DEVIN DAVIS,558,"Well, you're an upstanding White
Christian Man. I tell you this is why
we need more people like us in Public
Office. To get this Country back on
Track."
559,1636,RON STALLWORTH,559,Amen.
560,1637,DEVIN DAVIS,560,"For America to Achieve our
Greatness... again."
561,1638,RON STALLWORTH,561,"Absolutely. Sure wish we had the
chance to chat Face to Face."
562,1639,DEVIN DAVIS,562,"In due time, my friend, in due time.
I'll be in Colorado Springs for your
initiation..."
563,1640,RON STALLWORTH,563,You'll be in Colorado Springs?
564,1641,DEVIN DAVIS,564,"You bet your Mayflower Society Ass I
will."
565,1642,WALTER (O.S.),565,"We need a new Leader. Someone
everyone can unite behind. Felix
would Love to be The One but we can't
let that happen. He's a Crazy
Sonofvabitch. A Loose Cannon. We need
someone Articulate, who displays
Great Leadership qualities..."
566,1643,WALTER (O.S.) (CONT'D),566,"It should be you, Ron. You should be
Chapter President. You!!!"
567,1644,WALTER (O.S.) (CONT'D),567,COMPOSES HIMSELF:
568,1645,RON STALLWORTH,568,That would be quite an Honor.
569,1646,WALTER (O.S.),569,You will be Great...
570,1647,RON STALLWORTH,570,"I'll have to think about this. My
father is very ill and he lives in El
Paso. I won't have the time."
571,1648,WALTER (O.S.),571,"You're a Smart and Diligent Man. I've
got no doubt you could handle it."
572,1649,WALTER,572,"I think it's time for some new Blood
to get in here. I'm planning to step
down as your President."
573,1650,WALTER (CONT'D),573,"I'd like to make a nomination...
Mr. Ron Stallworth for Chapter
President."
574,1651,FELIX,574,We just met this Guy.
575,1652,FELIX,575,"Let me ask a question. Is there
anybody here that is willing to put
their Neck on the Line for Ron?"
576,1653,WALTER,576,I will vouch for Ron.
577,1654,FLIP,577,"It's a Big Honor but I can't accept.
Problem is, what you Good Men need is
a President who will be constant, on
CALL Day In, Day Out. I'll be back
and forth between here and Dallas."
578,1655,RON STALLWORTH,578,"El Paso, Flip, El Paso..."
579,1656,WALTER,579,Dallas? I thought it was El Paso.
580,1657,FLIP,580,Did I say Dallas?
581,1658,WALTER,581,You sure did.
582,1659,FELIX,582,Ron which One is it?
583,1660,IVANHOE,583,Make up your mind.
584,1661,FLIP,584,"Dallas is where my Plane layover is.
El Paso is where my sick Father is."
585,1662,IVANHOE,585,"Dallas, where they killed that Nigger
Lover Kennedy."
586,1663,FELIX,586,Where you learned that?
587,1664,IVANHOE,587,I can read.
588,1665,FLIP,588,"I just hope my Father isn't cared for
by some Texicano Spic Nurse."
589,1666,WALTER,589,We'll pray for ya Pop's health.
590,1667,IVANHOE,590,And Big Spic Teets!!!
591,1668,RON STALLWORTH,591,"I'm anxious to meet you and it will
be something I share with my Family
for Generations to come."
592,1669,DEVIN DAVIS,592,"I'm eager to meet you too, Ron."
593,1670,RON STALLWORTH,593,"Say, Mr. Davis... I just have to ask.
Aren't you ever concerned about some
Smart-Aleck Negro calling you and
pretending to be White?"
594,1671,DEVIN DAVIS,594,"No, I can always tell when I'm
talking to a Negro."
595,1672,RON STALLWORTH,595,How so?
596,1673,DEVIN DAVIS,596,"Take you, for example. I can tell you
are a pure Aryan White Man by the way
you pronounce certain words."
597,1674,RON STALLWORTH,597,Any examples?
598,1675,DEVIN DAVIS,598,"Take the word ""are"". A pure Aryan
like you or I would say it
correctly... like ""are"". Negroes
pronounce it ""are-uh""."
599,1676,RON STALLWORTH,599,"You are so White... Right. I want to
thank you for this Lesson because if
you had not brought it to my
attention, I would never have noticed
the difference between how We talk
and how Negroes talk."
600,1677,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),600,"From now on I'm going to pay close
attention to my Telephone
conversations so I can make sure I'm
not talking to one of dem' Sneaky
Coloreds."
601,1678,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),601,You okay?
602,1679,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),602,"I would love to continue this
conversation when you are in Colorado
Springs. Beautiful here, Sir. God's
Country."
603,1680,DEVIN DAVIS,603,"That's what I've heard, Ron. You have
a nice day."
604,1681,RON STALLWORTH,604,"You too, Sir. God Bless White
America."
605,1682,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),605,It's over!!! You can come back!!!
606,1683,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),606,Hello?
607,1684,FELIX (O.S.),607,It's Felix.
608,1685,FELIX (O.S.),608,Catch you at a bad time?
609,1686,RON STALLWORTH,609,Not at all. Just... finishing a Meal.
610,1687,FELIX (O.S.),610,"Meeting. My House. Now. Git ya Ass in
gear and don't tell Mealy Mouth
Walter."
611,1688,FELIX (O.S.),611,Welcome to The Promised Land.
612,1689,FELIX (CONT'D),612,"In about a week's time, we will be
welcoming Mr. Davis to our City."
613,1690,FELIX (CONT'D),613,Who's packing tonight?
614,1691,CONNIE,614,Won't be able to take it back.
615,1692,FELIX,615,"They're da' first of many Niggers
that must die, Honey Bun."
616,1693,CONNIE,616,"I know. It's just... becoming so
real. It's always seemed like a
dream."
617,1694,FELIX,617,"I know. It's just so beautiful. We're
cleansing this Country of a
backwards Race of Monkey's. First the
Spooks then the Kikes."
618,1695,FELIX (CONT'D),618,"Free at last! Free at Last! Thank God
a'mighty - Free a' dem Niggers At
Last!!!"
619,1696,CONNIE,619,"I love when you do that, Honey."
620,1697,CONNIE (CONT'D),620,"You know, we've talked about killing
Niggers for so many years and now
it's really happening."
621,1698,FELIX,621,"My Old Man always told me good things
come to those who wait."
622,1699,CONNIE,622,"Thank you for bringing me into you
Life. For loving me like you do and
giving me a purpose, direction."
623,1700,FELIX,623,"Y'know, this will be the Shot heard
around The World."
624,1701,FELIX,624,"Honey Bun, one day, The Great
Historians will write about us like
that. They'll say we were the
Patriots that saved America. You and
me. We turned the Tide. Saved our
True White Race... it fact, saved an
entire Nation and brought it back to
its Glorious Destiny."
625,1702,CONNIE,625,"In a way, we're The New Founding
Fathers."
626,1703,FELIX,626,Yes we are... Martha.
627,1704,CONNIE,627,Indeed we are... George.

their Armory. No suspects."
637,1714,RON STALLWORTH,637,Klan...?
638,1715,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),638,"We thought they might pull something.
But not like this?
AGENT Y
You won't see this on the News. For
obvious reasons but I thought it
might be of interest to you."
639,1716,RON STALLWORTH,639,"If you know about an attack, I need
to know when.
AGENT Y
You're the one with the Impressive
Investigation."
640,1717,RON STALLWORTH,640,"But... can't you, The FBI pitch in?"
641,1718,RON STALLWORTH,641,"AGENT Y
Federal Bureau of Investigation?"
642,1719,RON STALLWORTH,642,"AGENT Y (CONT'D)
Because we never had this
conversation."
643,1720,FELIX,643,"Flip, I'm starting to trust you. I'm
gonna tell you something none of our
Brothers know. My lil' sister married
a Nigger. Now I got a lil' Nigger
Niece and a lil' Nigger Nephew. Jesus
Christ, The World's going to Hell in
a Handbasket! Do me a favor, don't
tell nobody. Cuz' if you do, I'm
gonna have to shoot you dead. I'm
serious."
644,1721,FLIP,644,Thanks for sharing.
645,1722,RON STALLWORTH,645,"You can hate me all you want to, just
promise me you won't go to The
Protest."
646,1723,PATRICE,646,"I'm going. We're going. What are you
talking about?"
647,1724,RON STALLWORTH,647,"I can't say specifics but today, The
Klan is planning an Attack."
648,1725,PATRICE,648,Then we have to tell The People.
649,1726,RON STALLWORTH,649,Not an option.
650,1727,PATRICE,650,What's wrong with you?
651,1728,RON STALLWORTH,651,"No one can know while it's an Active
Investigation..."
652,1729,PATRICE,652,"Active Investigation? And pray tell
how do you know all this? You a Cop?"
653,1730,RON STALLWORTH,653,I'm not a Cop.
654,1731,PATRICE,654,"What are you, then?..."
655,1732,RON STALLWORTH,655,"...I'm a Undercover Detective. I've
been investigating The Klan."
656,1733,PATRICE,656,"Fuckin' KKK? Ron Stallworth, you lied
to me. Is that even your real name?"
657,1734,RON STALLWORTH,657,"Ron Stallworth is my first and last
name. Today's not the day..."
658,1735,PATRICE,658,"I take my Duties as President Of The
Black Student Union seriously. What
is this all about?"
659,1736,RON STALLWORTH,659,"All the good it does. You could sit
in the middle of Nevada Avenue and
set yourself on Fire and The Klan
will still be here."
660,1737,PATRICE,660,I'd be doing something. Unlike you.
661,1738,RON STALLWORTH,661,"Unlike Me? Don't think because I'm
not wearing a Black Beret, Black
Leather Jacket and Black Ray Bans
screaming ""KILL WHITEY"" doesn't mean
I don't care about my People."
662,1739,PATRICE,662,"That night we saw Brother Kwame...
were you Undercover then too?"
663,1740,RON STALLWORTH,663,Patrice...
664,1741,PATRICE,664,"...Answer the question. Were you
Undercover The Night we met?"
665,1742,PATRICE (CONT'D),665,"Ron Stallworth are you for Revolution
and The Liberation of Black People?"
666,1743,RON STALLWORTH,666,"I'm a Undercover Detective for The
Colorado Springs Police Department.
It's my J-O-B."
667,1744,PATRICE,667,"House Niggers said they had J-O-B-S
too. You disgust me."
668,1745,BUTCH,668,It's off.
669,1746,RON STALLWORTH,669,The March?
670,1747,BUTCH,670,Yeah.
671,1748,RON STALLWORTH,671,What's going on?
672,1749,BUTCH,672,You'll know soon enough.
673,1750,LANDERS,673,"...Davis needs protection. There's no
one else available."
674,1751,CHIEF BRIDGES,674,"Ron, it's Nut Cracking Time. Put your
Personal Politics aside."
675,1752,FLIP,675,"Chief, it's not about that and you
know it. Devin Davis and Ron have
been speaking over the phone, several
times. If he recognizes his voice...
or if any of The Klansmen do, it
could compromise Our Entire
Investigation."
676,1753,RON STALLWORTH,676,A Clusterfuck.
677,1754,CHIEF BRIDGES,677,"Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't
you boast that you were fluent in
both English and Jive?"
678,1755,CHIEF BRIDGES (CONT'D),678,Do you remember that?
679,1756,LANDERS,679,Answer The Chief!
680,1757,RON STALLWORTH,680,"Man, who you think you're talking to.
You've been trying to sabotage me
since Day One."
681,1758,CHIEF BRIDGES,681,Gentlemen.
682,1759,LANDERS,682,"Why you getting so worked up, Boy?"
683,1760,RON STALLWORTH,683,Who you callin' Boy?
684,1761,CHIEF BRIDGES,684,"If you let him get to you that easy,
you ain't got a Shot with Devin
Davis."
685,1762,CHIEF BRIDGES,685,"WALKER
Listen up. First, The Primary Target."
686,1763,CHIEF BRIDGES,686,"WALKER (CONT'D)
Felix says you're doing it. So all
you have to do is set the pocketbook
on the front porch, back porch, side
wall, doesn't matter. It just has to
be against the building. You can
plant it anywhere. There's enough C4
here to take the whole thing out."
687,1764,CHIEF BRIDGES,687,"WALKER
Be careful with that."
688,1765,FELIX,688,Understand?
689,1766,CONNIE,689,"I understand.
WALKER
All you have to do when you've placed
it..."
690,1767,CONNIE,690,"WALKER (CONT'D)
...is flip this switch. That's it.
Got it?"
691,1768,FELIX,691,"Miss Black Student Union Bitch is
bringing in some Old Coon to speak.
The place should be packed. So
Walker, nothing but rubble...
WALKER
...And Barbecue Niggers."
692,1769,FELIX,692,And what happens if that don't work?
693,1770,WALKER,693,Plan B.
694,1771,FELIX,694,"Can you handle it, Honey?"
695,1772,CONNIE,695,"You can count on me. I've been
waiting to do my part."
696,1773,WALKER,696,Lovebirds. Get a Hotel Room.
697,1774,IVANHOE,697,Can I feel it?
698,1775,WALKER,698,No!!! No feel!!!
699,1776,RON STALLWORTH,699,I'm Mr. Davis' Security Detail.
700,1777,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),700,"Hello, Mr. Davis. I'm a Detective
from The Colorado Springs Police
Department and I will be acting as
your Bodyguard today."
701,1778,DEVIN DAVIS,701,"Detective, pleased to meet you."
702,1779,RON STALLWORTH,702,"As you may know, there have been
several credible Threats against your
Well-Being."
703,1780,WALTER,703,Da Heck's going on here?
704,1781,DEVIN DAVIS,704,"There are Threats on my Life. This
Detective has been assigned as my
Bodyguard."
705,1782,RON STALLWORTH,705,"Let me be clear, Mr. Davis: I do not
agree with your Philosophies. However
I am a Professional and I will do
everything within my means and beyond
to keep you safe."
706,1783,DEVIN DAVIS,706,I appreciate your Professionalism.
707,1784,WALTER,707,"Sorry for the Extra Security today.
Can't be too careful. Ready to meet
Mr. Davis?"
708,1785,WALTER,708,"Mr. Davis, our newest recruit, Ron
Stallworth."
709,1786,DEVIN DAVIS,709,"Ron, it's my pleasure to finally meet
you in person."
710,1787,FLIP,710,You as well.
711,1788,FELIX,711,What's that doing here?
712,1789,IVANHOE,712,"Fuckin' Cop assigned to guard Mister
Davis. Isn't that the livin' Shits?"
713,1790,DEVIN DAVIS,713,"Everybody, it is time."
714,1791,FELIX,714,You stay here. Ya hear?
715,1792,FELIX,715,"JESSE
I'm Jesse Nayyar, Colorado's Grand
Dragon. I welcome you all to this
Sacred Ceremony."
716,1793,FELIX,716,"JESSE (CONT'D)
In a moment you will take a Life Oath
to join the most Sacred Brotherhood
this Nation has ever seen."
717,1794,DEVIN DAVIS,717,"My Brothers in Christ, Nobel Prize
recipient and Co-Creator of the
Transistor and my dear friend,
William Shockley, whose Scientific
work ushered in the Computer Age, has
proven through his Research with
Eugenics that each of us have flowing
through our veins the Genes of a
Superior Race. Today, we celebrate
that Truth."
718,1795,DEVIN DAVIS,718,"JESSE (CONT'D)
Hoods on, Gentlemen."
719,1796,PATRICE,719,"I am extremely honored today to
introduce our speaker for today
Mister Jerome Turner. Mr. Turner was
born in 1898 in Waco, Texas."
720,1797,PATRICE,720,"DEVIN DAVIS(O.S.)
God... give us True White Men. The
Invisible Empire demands strong
Minds, Great Heart, True Faith, and
ready hands..."
721,1798,PATRICE,721,"DEVIN DAVIS(O.S.) (CONT'D)
Men who have Honor. Men who will not
Lie. Men who can stand before a
Demagogue and damn his treacherous
flatteries without blinking."
722,1799,PATRICE,722,"JEROME TURNER
It was a nice spring day, Waco, Texas
May 15th, Nineteen Hundred and
Sixteen.
CUT BACK TO:"
723,1800,PATRICE,723,"JEROME TURNER (V.O.)(CONT'D)
Jesse Washington was a friend of
mine. He was Seventeen, I was
Eighteen. He was what they called
back then, Slow. Today it's called
Mentally Retarded.
CUT BACK TO:"
724,1801,PATRICE,724,"JEROME TURNER (CONT'D)
They claim Jesse Raped and Murdered a
White Woman named Lucy Fryer. They
put Jesse on Trial and he was
convicted by an All White Jury after
deliberating for Four Minutes."
725,1802,DEVIN DAVIS,725,"God give us real Men, Courageous, who
flinch not at Duty. Men of Dependable
Character, Men of Sterling Worth.
Then Wrongs will be Redressed and
Right will Rule The Earth. God give
us True White Men!"
726,1803,DEVIN DAVIS,726,"DEVIN DAVIS (CONT'D)
Ron Stallworth, come forward."
727,1804,JEROME TURNER,727,"I was working at the Shoe Shine
Parlor. After the verdict, a Mob
grabbed Jesse, wrapped a Chain around
his Neck and dragged him out the
Court House."
728,1805,JEROME TURNER,728,"JEROME TURNER (CONT'D)
I knew I had to hide."
729,1806,DEVIN DAVIS,729,"Ron Stallworth. Are you a White, Non-
Jewish American Citizen?"
730,1807,FLIP,730,Yes.
731,1808,DEVIN DAVIS,731,"Yes, what?"
732,1809,FLIP,732,"I am a White, Non-Jewish American
Citizen."
733,1810,FLIP,733,"JEROME TURNER (V.O.)
The Attic of the Parlor had a Small
Window and I watched below as The Mob
marched Jesse along Stabbing and
Beating him. Finally, they held Jesse
down and cut his Testicles off in
Front of City Hall."
734,1811,FLIP,734,"JEROME TURNER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The Police and City Officials were
out there just watching like it was a
4th of July Parade."
735,1812,DEVIN DAVIS,735,"Are you in favor of a White Man's
Government in this Country?"
736,1813,DEVIN DAVIS,736,"JEROME TURNER (V.O.)
They cut off Jesse's Fingers and
poured Coal Oil over his Bloody Body,
lit a Bonfire and for two hours they
raised and lowered Jesse into the
Flames over and over and over again."
737,1814,DEVIN DAVIS,737,"JEROME TURNER (CONT'D)
The Mayor had a Photographer by the
name of Gildersleeve come and take
Pictures of the whole Lynching.
DEVIN DAVIS (O.S.)
Ron Stallworth. Are you willing to
dedicate your Life to the Protection,
Preservation and Advancement of the
White Race?"
738,1815,DEVIN DAVIS,738,"DEVIN DAVIS (CONT'D)
In Mind, in Body, in Spirit."
739,1816,DEVIN DAVIS,739,"JEROME TURNER (V.O.)
The Pictures were sold as Post Cards.
They put Jesse's charred Body in a
Bag and dragged it through Town then
sold what was left of his remains as
Souvenirs."
740,1817,CUT BACK TO:,740,"Good White Folks cheered and laughed
and had a High Ole' Time. They
estimate close to Fifteen Thousand
people watched it. They brought The
Children out on Lunch hour from
School. All I could do was Watch and
Pray they wouldn't find me."
741,1818,CUT BACK TO:,741,"One of the reasons they did that to
Jesse was that Birth of a Nation
Movie had come out a year before. It
gave The Klan a Rebirth. It was what
was a Big, Big thing back then. Today
what they call a Blockbuster!
Everybody saw it. They say even The
President of The United States,
Woodrow Wilson showed the Movie in
the White House, he said ""it was
History written with Lighting""."
742,1819,WALTER,742,"Please everyone rise as The Grand
Wizard leads us in a toast."
743,1820,DEVIN DAVIS,743,"Look around, today we are privileged
to be among White Men such as
yourselves, Real Warriors for The
Real America, the One Our Ancestors
Fought and Died for."
744,1821,DEVIN DAVIS (CONT'D),744,"We are the True White American Race
the Backbone from whence came Our
Great Southern Heritage. To the USA!"
745,1822,FELIX,745,"I just want to say how Honored I am
to be in your presence."
746,1823,WALKER,746,He's a Cop.
747,1824,FELIX,747,Who?
748,1825,WALKER,748,That Guy.
749,1826,FELIX,749,Ron?
750,1827,WALKER,750,"No, the other Guy."
751,1828,FELIX,751,Ron's a Cop?
752,1829,WALKER,752,"No, his name is Phillip but his
nickname is Flip."
753,1830,FELIX,753,Who's Phillip?
754,1831,WALKER,754,"Who's Ron, that's Phillip."
755,1832,FELIX,755,What the Fuck are you talking about?
756,1833,WALKER,756,"That guy was the Cop that sent me
away to Prison for Armed Fucking
Robbery."
757,1834,WALKER,757,"WALKER (O.S.)
His name is Phillip... Phillip
Zimmerman."
758,1835,FELIX,758,What!
759,1836,WALKER,759,"Yeah, he's a Fuckin' Pig."
760,1837,FELIX,760,What's his name?
761,1838,WALKER,761,Phillip Zimmerman.
762,1839,FELIX,762,Isn't that a Jew name?
763,1840,WALKER,763,I don't know... probably.
764,1841,FELIX,764,So Ron Stallworth is a Fucking Jew.
765,1842,WALKER,765,Coulda' been worse.
766,1843,WALKER,766,"WALKER (CONT'D)
Coulda' been a Nigger."
767,1844,FELIX,767,He's a Nigger.
768,1845,FELIX (CONT'D),768,"That Cop guarding Davis. Zimmerman is
using his name."
769,1846,RON STALLWORTH,769,"RON (CONT'D)
One... Two... Three!"
770,1847,DEVIN DAVIS,770,"Nigger, What the Fuck did you just
do?"
771,1848,RON STALLWORTH,771,"If you lay one Finger on me, I'll
arrest you for assaulting a Police
Officer. That's worth about Five
Years in Prison. Try me. See if I'm
playing."
772,1849,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),772,"Thanks for the Photo, Mr. Davis. Big
Fan. God Bless WHITE AMERICA."
773,1850,FLIP,773,Boy you get ya' ass out NOW!
774,1851,FELIX (O.S.),774,Where's your Patrice?
775,1852,FELIX,775,Detective Stallworth!

778,1855,FELIX,778,"Ron, I believe you know my friend."
779,1856,FLIP,779,"No, I don't believe we've ever met."
780,1857,WALKER,780,It's been a few years.
781,1858,FLIP,781,"No, sorry, I can't place you."
782,1859,DEVIN DAVIS,782,Did you Guys go to School together?
783,1860,WALKER,783,"No, I went to a Private School in
Leavenworth, Kansas."
784,1861,FELIX,784,Isn't that where the Prison is?
785,1862,WALKER,785,Matter a fact it is.
786,1863,FELIX,786,"You know something about that. Don't
you, Flip?"
787,1864,FELIX,787,"JOSH
There's an emergency phone call in
the Lobby for a -- Felix Kendrickson."
788,1865,FELIX,788,"Don't say another word.
I'll be right back. Flip."

here! Somebody tipped them off."
790,1867,CONNIE (CONT'D),790,My God there goes another one!
791,1868,FELIX,791,"All right, calm down, we planned for
this. We'll go to Plan B. Okay?"
792,1869,CONNIE,792,Okay... Plan B.
793,1870,CONNIE,793,All right... Love You.
794,1871,WALKER,794,Excuse me Mister Davis.
795,1872,DEVIN DAVIS,795,"What was all that about? And why did
he keep calling you Flip?"
796,1873,FLIP,796,"We were in Prison together. Years
ago. It's an inside joke."
797,1874,DEVIN DAVIS,797,I hope everything's all right?
798,1875,FLIP,798,"Yeah, but I think he may have
violated his Parole. Excuse me..."
799,1876,RON STALLWORTH,799,Where's Patrice???
800,1877,HAKEEM,800,"Patrice and Odetta took Mister
Hopkins to his Hotel."
801,1878,HAKEEM,801,"Ivanhoe speeds toward Patrice's House with Felix in the
passenger seat and Walker hovering over them in the rear.

802,1879,HAKEEM,802,"Connie drives up. She sits there for a long moment staring at

the Bomb back inside while looking at Patrice and Odetta
getting out of the Car and getting Groceries from the trunk.
Patrice talks to Odetta, not noticing Connie. Connie quickly
leaves the porch striding to her car sweating, crazy nervous.
Patrice and Odetta talk, entering her House.

Connie looks back at Ron, increasing her pace.
RON STALLWORTH(CONT'D)

Connie breaks into a run. Ron dashes after her grabbing her
as she opens the Pick Up Truck door."

839,1916,RON STALLWORTH,839,"Ohhh, I get it."
840,1917,RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D),840,"You get it, Patrice?"
841,1918,PATRICE,841,"Oh, I totally and completely get it."

847,1924,FLIP,847,There he is... Man of the Minute.
848,1925,RON STALLWORTH,848,... not an Hour?
849,1926,FLIP (CONT'D),849,"That Polaroid Stunt you pulled? When
you threw your Arms around them, I
swear to God I almost Shit myself!"
850,1927,RON STALLWORTH,850,"Told you, Ron was born ready."
851,1928,FLIP,851,Born ready is Ron.
852,1929,SGT. TRAPP,852,There's The Crazy Son of a Bitch!!!
853,1930,SGT. TRAPP (CONT'D),853,You did good.
854,1931,RON STALLWORTH,854,Sarge. We did good.
855,1932,SGT. TRAPP,855,Chief wants to see you Guys.
856,1933,FLIP,856,Hey... early promotion?
857,1934,CHIEF BRIDGES,857,"Again, I can't commend you enough for
what you've achieved. You know there
was not a Single Cross Burning the
entire time you were involved?"
858,1935,RON STALLWORTH,858,I'm aware.
859,1936,CHIEF BRIDGES,859,"But all good things must come to an
end..."
860,1937,RON STALLWORTH,860,What does that mean?
861,1938,CHIEF BRIDGES,861,Budget Cuts.
862,1939,FLIP,862,Budget Cuts?
863,1940,CHIEF BRIDGES,863,"Inflation... I wish I had a choice.
My hands are tied. Besides, it looks
like there are no longer any tangible
Threats..."
864,1941,RON STALLWORTH,864,...Sounds like we did too good a job.
865,1942,CHIEF BRIDGES,865,Not a Bad Legacy to leave.
866,1943,CHIEF BRIDGES (CONT'D),866,"And I need you, Ron Stallworth, to
destroy all Evidence of this
Investigation."
867,1944,RON STALLWORTH,867,Excuse me?
868,1945,FLIP,868,This is total Horseshit.
869,1946,CHIEF BRIDGES,869,"We prefer that The Public never knew
about this Investigation."
870,1947,RON STALLWORTH,870,If they found out...
871,1948,CHIEF BRIDGES,871,"...Cease all further contact with The
Ku Klux Klan. Effective immediately.
That goes for Flip too. Ron
Stallworth..."
872,1949,RON STALLWORTH,872,This is some Fucked up Bullshit.
873,1950,CHIEF BRIDGES,873,"Take a week off. Go on vacation with
your Girlfriend. We'll hold down The
Fort until you get back. Get you
another assignment...Narcotics."
874,1951,RON STALLWORTH,874,"I'm sorry we didn't get to spend more
One-on-One time together."
875,1952,DEVIN DAVIS,875,"Well, that tragic event. I had just
met those Fine Brothers in the cause."
876,1953,RON STALLWORTH,876,"Our Chapter is just shaken to the
core. And poor Connie not only does
she lose her Husband but she's facing
a healthy Prison Sentence."
877,1954,DEVIN DAVIS,877,"My God. And then there was that one
Nigger Detective who threatened me."
878,1955,RON STALLWORTH,878,"Goddamn Coloreds sure know how to
spoil a Celebration."
879,1956,DEVIN DAVIS,879,Christ. You can say that again.
880,1957,RON STALLWORTH,880,"Can I ask you something? That Nigger
Detective who gave you a hard time?
Ever get his name?"
881,1958,DEVIN DAVIS,881,"No, I..."
882,1959,RON STALLWORTH,882,"...Are-uh you sure you don't know who
he is? Are-uh you absolutely sure?"

Colorado Springs Police Department?"
887,1964,RON STALLWORTH,887,"Negative. Truth be told I've always
wanted to be a Cop...and I'm still
for The Liberation for My People."
888,1965,PATRICE,888,"My Conscience won't let me Sleep with
The Enemy."
889,1966,RON STALLWORTH,889,"Enemy? I'm a Black Man that saved
your life."
890,1967,PATRICE,890,"You're absolutely right, and I Thank
