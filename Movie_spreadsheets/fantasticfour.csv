0,REED,0,"High open space, exposed structural
elements.  Obviously aimed at first
time visitors to create feelings of...
smallness, inadequacy."
1,BEN,1,"Good thing it ain't workin... Reed,
what are we doing here?  This guy's
fast-food, strip-mall science --"
2,REED,2,"This wasn't our first stop, in case
you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not
that bad.  He's just a little..."
3,REED,3,Larger than life.
4,REED,4,"He's financed some of the biggest
breakthroughs of this century."
5,BEN,5,You'd never know it.
6,BEN (CONT'D),6,Jesus.  That too?
7,REED,7,Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see --
8,FEMALE RECEPTIONIST,8,"Executive elevator, top floor."
9,BEN,9,What's the price for a smile round here?
10,REED (O.S.),10,"My research suggests that exposure to
a high-energy cosmic storm born on
solar winds might have triggered the
evolution of early planetary life."
11,REED (CONT'D),11,"In six weeks another cloud with the
same elemental profile will pass
Earth's orbit.  A study in space could
advance our knowledge about the
structure of the human genome, and
help cure countless diseases, extend
human life --"
12,REED (CONT'D),12,"Give kids the chance to be stronger,
healthier, less prone to --"
13,SHADOWED FIGURE,13,Turn it off.  Please.
14,REED,14,But I haven't fully explained my --
15,SHADOWED FIGURE,15,"Yes you have... Imagination.
Creativity.  Passion.  Those were
always your trademarks."
16,VICTOR,16,"But dreams don't pay the bills, do
they?"
17,VICTOR,17,"Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist.
Still reaching for the stars, with the
world on your back."
18,REED,18,"You remember in school we talked about
working together.  That's what I was
about to explain..."
19,VICTOR,19,"So it's not my money you want.  It's
my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn't
trust you, why should I?"
20,VICTOR (CONT'D),20,"That's my job.  To stay a step ahead.
To know what other men don't."
21,BEN,21,I can't take this.
22,REED,22,Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
23,SUE (O.S.),23,"He's right, Ben."
24,SUE (CONT'D),24,It's just business.
25,VICTOR,25,"I think you both know my Director of
Genetic Research, Susan Storm."
26,BEN,26,Heya Susie.
27,BEN,27,One more thing he's got.
28,SUE,28,"Ben, it's been too long."
29,REED,29,"You're, you've, I mean, how have you
bee--"
30,SUE,30,Never better.
31,VICTOR,31,"This isn't going to be a problem, is
it?"
32,REED,32,Not at all.
33,SUE,33,Ancient history.
34,VICTOR,34,"Good.  Then you're just in time to
hear the great Reed Richards ask me
for help."
35,VICTOR,35,"You know, you made a lot of folks at
MIT feel like a junior high science
fair.  So you'll excuse me if I savor
the moment."
36,REED,36,"You back this mission, and I'll sign
over a fair percentage of any
applications or --"
37,VICTOR,37,"The number's seventy-five.  And it's
applications and patents."
38,BEN,38,What about his first born?
39,REED,39,"Ben, the money's not important.  We
could save lives."
40,VICTOR,40,"Twenty-five percent of a billion is
enough to keep the lights on, isn't
it?  Maybe even pay off your fourth
mortgage on the Baxter Building."
41,VICTOR (CONT'D),41,Deal...?
42,VICTOR (CONT'D),42,"Well then, to our future.  Together."
43,VICTOR (CONT'D),43,"Funny how things turn out, isn't it?"
44,REED,44,Hilarious.
45,VICTOR,45,"If Reed's right, then this little trip
will double our stock offering."
46,LEONARD,46,And if he's not...?
47,VICTOR,47,"Reed's always right.  Good thing he
doesn't always know what he's got..."
48,BEN,48,"He knew about NASA.  What if he made
the call to shut us down --"
49,REED,49,"Ben, think about all the people we can
help if this works --"
50,BEN,50,"Maybe you should think about yourself
for once.  You always let this guy
push you round --"
51,REED,51,"We got what we wanted.  That's
enough."
52,BEN,52,"I know, I know.  I'm just worried
about what he wants... Speaking of
which..."
53,SUE,53,"You sure about this, Reed?"
54,REED,54,"Those solar winds are flaring, but I
factored them into my coordinates and --"
55,SUE,55,"I was talking about us.  Working
together."
56,REED,56,"Well, uh, based on our history...you
can handle the biogenetics, and I'll
focus on the molecular physics.  Or,
uhm, maybe I should take the biotech,
you work the microscopes, since you
have some background in electropho--"
57,SUE,57,Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
58,BEN,58,Way to not overthink it.
59,BEN,59,So when do we leave?
60,SUE,60,"I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in
the morning to talk about resources
and crew."
61,REED,61,"I, uh, think I remember the number."
62,SUE,62,It's been changed.
63,REED,63,"As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could
pilot the mission --"
64,SUE,64,"Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun,
but we already have a pilot on our
payroll.  You remember my brother
Johnny..."
65,BEN,65,Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
66,REED,66,"External SRBs, orbital system engines.
Its just like the shuttles you flew
in --"
67,BEN,67,"No.  I cannot take orders from that
underwear model.  That wingnut washed
out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria
Secret wannabes into a flight
simulator."
68,REED,68,Youthful high spirits.
69,BEN,69,"They crashed it into a wall.  A flight
simulator."
70,REED,70,I'm sure he's matured since then.
71,REED (CONT'D),71,"When have I asked you to do something
you absolutely said you could not do?"
72,BEN,72,Five times.
73,REED,73,I had it at four.
74,BEN,74,This makes five.
75,JOHNNY (O.S.),75,Captain on the bridge!
76,JOHNNY (CONT'D),76,"Digital camera: $254.  Memory stick:
$59.  The look on your hard-ass former
CO's grill when he finds out he's your
junior officer: priceless."
77,BEN,77,"I can handle the ship.  I can even
handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I
don't know if I should be flying or
playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the
hell came up with them?"
78,SUE,78,Victor did.
79,SUE (CONT'D),79,"The synthetics act as a second skin,
adapting to your individual needs to --"
80,JOHNNY,80,"Keep the hot side hot, and the cool
side cool!"
81,REED,81,Wow.  Fantastic.
82,REED (CONT'D),82,"Material made from self-regulating
unstable molecules.  I've been working
on a formula for this."
83,SUE,83,Great minds think alike.
84,VICTOR (O.S.),84,Guess some think faster than others.
85,VICTOR (CONT'D),85,"I hired Armani to design the pattern.
These colors will look great on
camera."
86,LEONARD,86,"They're ready for you, sir."
87,VICTOR,87,Showtime.
88,LEONARD,88,"Our numbers are through the roof.  The
IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a
share.  The bank's five times
oversubscribed --"
89,VICTOR,89,"It's not just the money.  I could make
money in my sleep."
90,LEONARD,90,Then what is it?
91,VICTOR,91,"History, Leonard.  History.
Everything else is conversation..."
92,VICTOR,92,How's the other matter?
93,LEONARD,93,Harry Winston sends his regards.
94,VICTOR,94,"Today we stand on the edge of a new
frontier.  In the furthest depths of
outer space...we will find the secrets
to inner space.  The final key to
unlocking our genetic code lies in a
cosmic storm..."
95,BEN,95,Isn't that your speech?
96,REED,96,He's made a few changes.
97,BEN,97,"This is your dream, Reed.  You should
be the one up there."
98,REED,98,Victor's better at these things.
99,BEN,99,I'll be watching over you.
100,DEBBIE,100,"Just get back soon, or I start looking
for a new groom."
101,BEN,101,"Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that
in for a bigger rock."
102,DEBBIE,102,"I don't care about rocks, I care about
you."
103,DEBBIE,103,"You bring him back in one piece, or
you can forget being Best Man."
104,BEN,104,"What the hell you smiling at?  Just
keep your mouth shut, and your mind on
those SMBs --"
105,JOHNNY,105,"Actually, the engines are SMEs.
Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant.
Couple generations past your last
ride."
106,JOHNNY,106,I'm not as dumb as you look.
107,VICTOR,107,"Think of a world without genetic flaws
-- no asthma, allergies, baldness,
breast cancer..."
108,BEN,108,What's wrong with being bald...?
109,VICTOR,109,"Darwin discovered evolution.  Now we --
I -- will define it.  Only in America
could..."
110,VICTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D),110,"...a little country boy from Latveria
build one of the biggest companies in
the world, and truly reach the stars.
Now if you'll excuse me, history
awaits..."
111,JOHNNY,111,"If you behave, maybe next time
daddy'll let you drive."
112,BEN,112,"Keep talking, there won't be a next
time."
113,SUE,113,"Long way from the projection booth at
the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it?"
114,REED,114,Yes.  Yes it is.
115,VICTOR,115,"Leonard, how's the feed?"
116,LEONARD (V.O.),116,"Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly."
117,SUE,117,"We can monitor the cloud's approach
and observe the tests from here."
118,BEN,118,Is it safe?
119,REED,119,"The shields on the station should
protect us."
120,BEN,120,Should?
121,VICTOR,121,"What's wrong, Ben?  Eighty-million
dollars worth of equipment not enough
for you?"
122,REED,122,"Let's start loading those samples.
Get your suit ready, Ben."
123,VICTOR,123,So you still do all the heavy lifting?
124,VICTOR (CONT'D),124,"Maybe you should have stayed back in
the lab.  Field work never suited you."
125,BEN,125,"He does the talking.  I do the
walking.  Got it?"
126,VICTOR,126,"Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm
going to borrow Susan for a second."
127,REED,127,Sure.
128,JOHNNY,128,"Please tell me your dawg's not trying
to rekindle things with my sister."
129,BEN,129,'Course not.  Strictly business.
130,JOHNNY,130,"Yeah, well, his eyes say different."
131,BEN,131,"Hey, two hearts got busted last time.
Maybe she's not over it either."
132,JOHNNY,132,"Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the
year, more coin than God?  Or Reed,
the world's dumbest smart guy worth
less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's
a toss-up."
133,BEN,133,Put your tiny little mind at ease.
134,JOHNNY,134,"Don't you wander off, boy."
135,VICTOR,135,Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
136,SUE,136,I understand the business reasons.
137,VICTOR,137,"Well, when you're looking at your
future, it never hurts to find closure
about the past."
138,VICTOR (CONT'D),138,"Susan, every man dreams that he'll
meet some woman he can give the world
to."
139,VICTOR (CONT'D),139,"In my case, it's not just a metaphor."
140,REED,140,"No...no...impossible.  It's...too
fast."
141,VICTOR,141,You've been with me two years now.
142,SUE,142,"It's been a good two years, Victor...
The company's accomplished so much."
143,VICTOR,143,"Right, of course, the company... But
you see, I've come to realize all the
accomplishments in the world mean
nothing without someone to share them
with --"
144,SUE,144,"Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done
something to make you think..."
145,VICTOR,145,"Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of
taking big steps.  And this is the
biggest step yet.  If it helps, think
of this as a promotion.  A merger of
sorts..."
146,VICTOR,146,"Four little words that can change our
lives..."
147,REED,147,The cloud is accelerating!
148,REED (CONT'D),148,I don't know what happened.
149,REED (CONT'D),149,"We've got minutes until it hits, not
hours...Victor, that storm's deadly --
the radiation's lethal.  We need to
abort."
150,VICTOR,150,"Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all
this way to lose our nerve at the
first little glitch.  Just close the
shields..."
151,REED,151,Ben's still out there --
152,VICTOR,152,"So reel him in.  But we came here to
do a job.  So let's do it.  Quickly."
153,REED (ON RADIO),153,"Ben, we need you back inside."
154,BEN (INTO RADIO),154,"I ain't done arranging your flowers,
egghead."
155,REED (ON RADIO),155,Ben.  This is serious.  Turn around.
156,BEN (INTO RADIO),156,"Roger that, on my way."
157,AUTOMATED VOICE,157,Event threshold in two minutes.
158,REED,158,"Come on, Ben, come on..."
159,VICTOR (ON RADIO),159,"Reed, we're running out of time."
160,SUE,160,Johnny... Reed...
161,VICTOR,161,"Reed, you need to get up here so we
can close the shields!  Now!"
162,REED (ON RADIO),162,Not until Ben is back inside!
163,VICTOR,163,"It's too late for him, and soon it'll
be too late for all of us."
164,SUE,164,What are you doing?
165,VICTOR,165,Raising the shields.
166,SUE,166,You can't leave them out there.
167,VICTOR,167,"Watch me.  Reed had his chance.  You
can't help them any more than I can."
168,SUE,168,I can try.
169,REED,169,"Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the
command center.  Close the shields."
170,JOHNNY,170,What about you?
171,JOHNNY (CONT'D),171,"Come on big guy, you can do it!"
172,AUTOMATED VOICE,172,Event threshold in thirty seconds.
173,AUTOMATED VOICE,173,"Event threshold in ten seconds.
TEN..."
174,SUE,174,Johnny!  Reed!
175,AUTOMATED VOICE,175,FIVE...FOOOOUUUR...
176,REED,176,He's not responsive --
177,JOHNNY,177,Ben!  Ben!
178,JOHNNY'S VOICE,178,"Ben, wake up!  Wake up!"
179,BEN (O.S.),179,Where...where am I?
180,JOHNNY,180,"Back on Earth.  Victor's medical
facility... We're in quarantine."
181,BEN (O.S.),181,Reed? ... Sue?
182,JOHNNY,182,"They're fine.  Everybody else...is
fine."
183,BEN (O.S.),183,What's wrong with me?
184,JOHNNY,184,"I swear to you they've done everything
humanly possible.  The best plastic
surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had
the best --"
185,BEN (O.S.),185,Give me a mirror...
186,JOHNNY,186,"They said that's not such a good idea,
the shock alone could --"
187,BEN (O.S.),187,Give me the god damn mirror!
188,JOHNNY,188,"Unfortunately, the doctors just
couldn't do anything to fix your face!"
189,JOHNNY,189,"Nice 'do.  Going for the ""grandpa""
look?"
190,REPORTER #1,190,"You've been accused in the past of
moving science a little too fast --"
191,VICTOR,191,Accused by who?  My competitors?
192,REPORTER #2,192,"But surely this accident gives you
pause --"
193,VICTOR,193,"Danger is always part of discovery.
What would have happened if Ben
Franklin never went out in a storm?
Without risk, there's no reward."
194,REPORTER #3,194,"So where's the reward?  You promised a
cure-all."
195,VICTOR,195,"And you'll have it.  I've never come
up short.  And I'm not going to start
now."
196,REPORTER #2,196,So you're still taking VDI public --
197,VICTOR,197,"Yes, of course.  I've never been more
confident in the compan--"
198,REED,198,How's she doing?
199,DOCTOR,199,Stable.  Vitals are strong.
200,REED,200,"Blood panels show no irradiation.
Good.  You'll step up this protocol,
every --"
201,DOCTOR,201,"Four hours.  We know what we're
doing... One more day of observation,
then you're all cleared."
202,REED,202,Sue...I want to tell you...I'm...
203,REED (CONT'D),203,"She's allergic to orchids.  Put that
Amaryllis Apapathos by her bed.  The
African lilies?  They're her
favorites."
204,SEXY NURSE,204,And where do we think we're going?
205,JOHNNY,205,"I don't know if ""we've"" noticed, but
the sickest runs this side of the Alps
are right outside that window --"
206,NURSE,206,"I've noticed... But doctor's orders,
you're not allowed to leave until we --"
207,JOHNNY,207,"Finish the tests, I know -- could you
give me a hand with this zipper?"
208,NURSE,208,You know this is not a ski resort.
209,JOHNNY,209,Not yet.
210,JOHNNY (CONT'D),210,"Luckily grandma still sends care
packages."
211,NURSE,211,You are trouble.
212,JOHNNY,212,Brubbles my Triddle Name.
213,SEXY NURSE,213,You're hot!
214,JOHNNY,214,So are you!
215,SEXY NURSE,215,"I mean, you feel a little feverish."
216,JOHNNY,216,"I've never felt better in my life.
When do you get off work?"
217,SEXY NURSE,217,"My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --"
218,JOHNNY,218,"Meet me at 4:01, top of the run.
That'll give you a minute to freshen
up."
219,BEN,219,How long was I out?
220,REED,220,"Three days.  I was worried about you.
How are you feeling?"
221,BEN,221,Solid.
222,BEN (CONT'D),222,How you doing?
223,REED,223,"I don't know.  I just keep going over
and over the numbers."
224,BEN,224,"Reed.  Even you can't compute every
little thing."
225,REED,225,"I should have done more, run more
tests --"
226,BEN,226,"It was a freak of nature.  Last I
checked, you don't have a crystal
ball.  Let it go."
227,BEN (CONT'D),227,"You go through something like this,
makes you appreciate having the right
woman in your life."
228,REED,228,"Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --"
229,BEN,229,"Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie."
230,REED,230,"What?  Come on.  She's got a good
thing with Victor --"
231,BEN,231,"I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen
your screws?"
232,REED,232,"He's smart, powerful, successful --"
233,BEN,233,Well maybe you should date him.
234,REED,234,"Ben.  He'll give her the life she
deserves.  She ended up with the right
guy.  Things worked out for the best."
235,BEN,235,Do I have to do everything myself?
236,JOHNNY,236,Me like-y.
237,SEXY NURSE,237,Stay right.  Left is trouble.
238,JOHNNY,238,I though we went over this.
239,SEXY NURSE,239,"Last one down springs for room
service."
240,SEXY NURSE,240,You're on fire!
241,JOHNNY,241,Not this again --
242,SEXY NURSE,242,No: You're ON FIRE!
243,JOHNNY,243,Care to join me?
244,VICTOR,244,How's the IPO?
245,LEONARD,245,"Stable.  We're looking at low
twenties.  It's a good number,
considering the fallout from --"
246,VICTOR,246,"Reed's disaster.  You know, I half-
think he did this to me on purpose."
247,LEONARD,247,"Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --"
248,VICTOR,248,"Get me on the AM shows, Larry King,
cover of the Journal..."
249,VICTOR,249,"I've got to do something about this
scar.  Make sure they only shoot my
right side."
250,LEONARD,250,"Actually, uh, people seem to think the
scar ""humanizes"" you."
251,VICTOR,251,And that's a good thing?
252,LEONARD,252,"You know, maybe you should get some
rest --"
253,VICTOR,253,"Later.  First, I've got some
unfinished business.  A deal that
needs closing..."
254,LEONARD,254,"Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue?
You could have any woman in the world
but --"
255,VICTOR,255,"That's why.  Because I could have
any other woman... You know, when
they asked Caesar ""why England,"" he
said, ""because it's not mine."""
256,SUE,256,"I can only stay for one drink, Ben.
I've got to meet with Victor."
257,BEN,257,Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
258,BEN (CONT'D),258,"Hey Reed, what are you doing here?"
259,BEN (CONT'D),259,"Great, why don't you join us?"
260,BEN (CONT'D),260,"God, I'm starving.  Gonna hit the
buffet."
261,BEN,261,Pardon me...
262,REED,262,Are you alright?
263,BEN,263,"I think I need to lie down.  Bad
shrimp."
264,BEN (CONT'D),264,Really bad shrimp.
265,REED,265,Feeling better?
266,SUE,266,"Yes, thanks."
267,REED,267,That's good.  That's uh...good.
268,SUE,268,You always had a way with words.
269,SUE,269,I should be getting back.
270,REED,270,I'm really happy for you and Victor.
271,SUE,271,You're happy for me and Victor.
272,REED,272,"I can tell you guys are enjoying what
was the best part of our relationship --"
273,SUE,273,Which was?
274,REED,274,Passion.
275,REED (CONT'D),275,For science.
276,SUE,276,"You are such a dork, Reed... You never
got it and never will unless it's
explained to you in quantum physics."
277,REED,277,What?  What did I say?
278,SUE,278,"It's never what you say.  It's what
you don't say. What you don't do..."
279,REED,279,I...I...I just wanted to --
280,SUE,280,"It's been two years, and all you can
say is you're happy for me and some
other guy..."
281,SUE,281,"You know, Victor may be a lot of
things, but at least he's not afraid
to fight for what he wants..."
282,SUE,282,"And it's nice to be wanted sometimes.
To be heard...seen... Reed, look at
me."
283,REED,283,"Uh, Sue...?  I can't."
284,SUE,284,What?  What do you mean you --
285,REED,285,Sue...look at your hands.
286,JOHNNY (O.S.),286,"You guys will not believe what just
happened!"
287,SUE,287,"It has to be the cloud.  It's
fundamentally altered our DNA."
288,REED,288,"Let's not jump to conclusions, we need
a massive amount of evidence before
making that leap."
289,JOHNNY,289,Now what is up with that?
290,REED,290,"The cloud has fundamentally altered
our DNA."
291,JOHNNY,291,Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
292,SUE,292,Apparently I can disappear.
293,JOHNNY,293,Please tell me you go silent too.
294,REED,294,We have to find Ben.
295,JOHNNY,295,"Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame
off --"
296,SUE,296,Johnny.
297,SUE (CONT'D),297,Stop it.
298,JOHNNY,298,"Okay, ""mom."""
299,JOHNNY (CONT'D),299,"Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my
nurse!"
300,REED (O.S.),300,"Ben, are you there?"
301,SUE (O.S.),301,"Open up Ben, we need to talk."
302,BEN,302,LEAVE ME ALONE!!!
303,JOHNNY,303,Ewwwwwwww.  That is disgusting.
304,REED,304,...Ben?
305,JOHNNY,305,What is that thing?
306,SUE,306,I think that thing is Ben.
307,VICTOR,307,What's going on?
308,SUE,308,"Victor, are you feeling alright?"
309,VICTOR,309,"Just a little banged up.  A couple
scrapes.  Why?"
310,REED,310,Ben did this.
311,VICTOR,311,Ben did this?
312,REED,312,"He's had some kind of...reaction to
exposure from the cloud.  And he's not
the only one."
313,SUE,313,We need to find him.
314,SUE (CONT'D),314,"Victor, I'm sorry I --"
315,VICTOR,315,Just find him.
316,JOHNNY,316,"Anybody know where the big guy's
going?"
317,REED,317,He's going home.
318,BEN,318,"Hello, Operator?"
319,BEN (CONT'D),319,"Deb... It's me.  I need you to step
out front."
320,DEBBIE,320,"Out front?  You home, baby?  I got
a surprise for you."
321,BEN,321,I got a surprise for you too.
322,DEBBIE,322,Ben?
323,BEN (O.S.),323,"Don't come any closer for a sec.  This
is gonna be kind of a shock... You
remember when we said ""together
forever no matter what""?"
324,DEBBIE,324,"Baby, you're scaring me."
325,DEBBIE,325,"Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to
Ben?"
326,BEN,326,"Deb, it's me.  It's still me."
327,DEBBIE,327,Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME!
328,BEN,328,"I love you, Deb."
329,VICTOR,329,"Make sure you find Ben, bring him back
here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't
need this to hit the press."
330,LEONARD,330,"Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at
eight, then a nine-thirty interview
with the Journal --"
331,VICTOR,331,Front page?
332,LEONARD,332,"Top left, like you asked."
333,LEONARD,333,"Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who
knows...maybe Washington."
334,VICTOR,334,Leonard.  Think bigger.
335,BEN,335,"A few days in space, it'll be great,
what's the worst that could happen?"
336,BEN (CONT'D),336,Perfect.  Thanks.
337,BEN (CONT'D),337,"You think you got trouble?  Take a
good look, pal, how bad could it be?"
338,BEN (CONT'D),338,"Okay, easy there, buddy."
339,BEN (CONT'D),339,"You had to choose my spot, didn't you?"
340,BEN (CONT'D),340,This is really not my day.
341,BEN,341,"A little help here?!  You wanna hit
that button, sir?"
342,COP,342,"FREEZE!  PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT
DOWN!"
343,JOHNNY,343,Not even Ben deserves that.
344,BRIDGE COP,344,Back!  We're evac-ing the bridge.
345,SUE,345,What now?  Reed...?  What do we do?
346,SUE (CONT'D),346,Ben's out there.  Let's go get him.
347,BRIDGE COP,347,"Maybe you didn't hear me.  Those cars
are gonna blow sky high, any second."
348,REED,348,"Look, we've got a friend out there in
trouble.  We need to get to him before --"
349,BRIDGE COP #2,349,Nobody gets past this point.
350,SUE,350,What?
351,REED,351,We need to get past them.
352,BRIDGE COP #1,352,What the hell is this?  A magic show?
353,REED,353,Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
354,SUE,354,What...?
355,SUE,355,Oh.
356,JOHNNY,356,This is wrong in so many ways.
357,REED,357,You've been working out.
358,SUE,358,Shut up.
359,SUE (CONT'D),359,"Any more ideas, Reed?  Maybe you
should strip down next, see how it
feels to have fifty people staring --"
360,REED,360,"Uh, Sue?"
361,SUE (INVISIBLE),361,Oh.  Well then...
362,JOHNNY,362,I'm gonna need serious therapy.
363,BEN,363,What the --!
364,REED,364,Ben.  Are you okay?
365,BEN,365,Am I okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
366,BEN (CONT'D),366,"Or this?!  What the hell am I? 'Cause
I sure ain't Ben anymore."
367,SUE (O.S.),367,REED!  BEN!  LOOK OUT!
368,REED,368,"I swear to you, I will do everything
in my power until there is not a
breath left in me: you are going to be
Ben again."
369,LEONARD,369,"Uh, sir...Larry King called, to
cancel."
370,LEONARD,370,"Apparently, there's a bigger story."
371,CHIEF FIREMAN,371,"There's some folks outside, want to
talk to you."
372,REED,372,"We're not going public with this.
We're scientists, not celebrities."
373,CHIEF FIREMAN,373,"Too late, son."
374,CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D),374,"That's what they're calling you.  The
Fantastic Four."
375,JOHNNY,375,Nice.
376,SUE,376,"Johnny, slow down.  Let's think this
through, a second."
377,JOHNNY,377,Okay.  Done thinking.
378,CHIEF FIREMAN,378,So which one of you's the leader?
379,JOHNNY,379,That'd be me.
380,CHIEF FIREMAN,380,No seriously.
381,CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D),381,"You're on, son.  They all want a
statement."
382,REED,382,"Uh, during our recent mission to the
Von Doom space station, we were
exposed to as yet-unidentified
radioactive energy, most likely some
kind of nucleotide compoun--"
383,VARIOUS REPORTERS,383,"What happened on the bridge?  Does it
hurt to stretch?  Were you really on
fire?  Is it true that one of you can
fly?"
384,JOHNNY,384,Working on it.  And it's a lot harder --
385,SUE,385,"We don't know much more than you do,
at this point.  Which is why we will
be going directly to the lab, where we
can diagnose our symptoms and --"
386,REPORTER #2,386,Symptoms?  So it's like a disease?
387,JOHNNY,387,"Symptoms?  Please.  If having powers
is a disease, then yeah we got it.
And we are gonna blow your minds.
There's a new day dawning.  The day of
the Fantastic Four."
388,REPORTER #3,388,That thing doesn't look too fantastic.
389,REED,389,"Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero
who's been through a terrible orde--"
390,JOHNNY,390,"What he's trying to say is: every team
needs a mascot..."
391,REED,391,"Look, we went up to space to find a
way to understand DNA, to cure
disease, save lives.  Well, now it's
our DNA, our disease, our lives on the
line..."
392,REED,392,Thank you.  No more questions.
393,BEN,393,Be nice.
394,NED CECIL,394,"Well, Victor, the bank would like to
congratulate you.  On the fastest
freefall since the Depression.  We
can't even give your stock away."
395,VICTOR,395,"Ned, you know I can turn this around."
396,NED CECIL,396,"You promised a cure-all, and came back
with this.  Who the hell's going to
invest in a biotech company that turns
its workers into circus freaks?"
397,VICTOR,397,I really appreciate all your support.
398,NED CECIL,398,"You've got a week, Victor.  One week
to turn this around.  Or we pull
out..."
399,NED CECIL,399,This meeting is over.
400,VICTOR,400,"Goddamn book-keeper doesn't know
preferred stock from livestock."
401,LEONARD,401,"Sir.  Reed's comments at that press
conference killed us.  How are we
going to turn this around?"
402,VICTOR,402,"Very simple.  I cure them.  If I can
cure these freaks, then I can cure
anyone.  What better way to restore my
reputation?"
403,JOHNNY,403,"Smile, Ben.  They want to like you.
Give 'em your good side.  Or your less
bad side."
404,BEN,404,Uh...don't do drugs.
405,O'HOOLIHAN,405,"Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr.
Richards.  All that for you?"
406,REED,406,I'm afraid so...
407,SUE,407,Jimmy.  Good to see you again.
408,O'HOOLIHAN,408,"Good to see you too... Don't worry,
sir.  I know how crowded that head of
yours is."
409,REED,409,Any visitors while I was away?
410,O'HOOLIHAN,410,"Just the usual.  Told 'em you were
circling round outer space."
411,REED,411,We had a tough year.
412,BEN,412,"Yeah, nine years straight."
413,JOHNNY,413,"Twenty?  From outside the place looks
a lot taller."
414,REED,414,"Oh, it is."
415,JOHNNY,415,"Either we're moving really fast...or
not at all."
416,BEN,416,I'll take the stairs.
417,SUE,417,"How come Ben can't turn it on and off
like us?"
418,REED,418,That's what we're here to find out.
419,SUE,419,"If it happened to him, then it
could..."
420,JOHNNY,420,"Wait.  You mean there's chance we
could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?"
421,SUE,421,"Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run
around on fire for the rest of your
life?"
422,JOHNNY,422,"Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I
can't be the only one who thinks
this is cool."
423,REED,423,"We should stay here until we can
define the extent of our changes..."
424,JOHNNY,424,This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
425,REED,425,"...and figure out how to reverse them.
Let me show you to your rooms."
426,VICTOR,426,"God, I've been so worried about you."
427,SUE,427,"Victor, your scar --"
428,VICTOR,428,"I told you, I'm fine.  It's you I'm
worried about."
429,SUE,429,I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
430,VICTOR,430,"Please, no apologies.  I've arranged
for your things to be moved to one of
my condos.  You'll have round-the
clock care."
431,SUE,431,"Thank you, that's generous, but I
think I should stay here.  With my
brother.  Until we get a handle on
this."
432,VICTOR,432,"Sue.  I think you should let my
doctors have a look at you."
433,REED (O.S.),433,Victor!  What are you doing here?
434,VICTOR,434,"I'm starting to wonder the same
thing... How much do you know about
what happened to you?"
435,REED,435,"Not much.  We need to run tests to see
the extent of the damage."
436,VICTOR,436,"Well, let me know if there is anything
I can do.  We're all in this together
now."
437,REED,437,"Victor wait... I just wanted to say,
I'm sorry the mission didn't go as
planned --"
438,VICTOR,438,"Didn't go as planned?  It was a
catastrophe.  You ruined the lives of
four people --"
439,REED,439,"I ruined?  With all due respect, I
told you to abort --"
440,VICTOR,440,"Abort?  Reed, I put my company, my
name, billions of dollars on the line,
and I will not let you make me look
like a fool --"
441,REED,441,"Victor, if we could understand what
happened to us --"
442,VICTOR,442,"I don't want to understand it.  This
isn't one of your science projects.  I
just want to fix it.  Fast!"
443,VOICE (O.S.),443,"There a problem, Vic?"
444,VICTOR,444,"No problem, Ben."
445,VICTOR (CONT'D),445,"Just pay your goddamn electric bill,
and get to work on a cure."
446,BEN,446,You got a chisel round here?
447,REED,447,"If we're going to identify the source
of the mutation, we need to isolate
your recombinant DNA so we can
activate positional genomes."
448,SUE,448,"We need to give you a physical, so we
know what got zapped."
449,BEN,449,"Well why didn't you say so?  You want
me to lift some weights or something?"
450,REED,450,"No, just sit back.  We have a good
sense of your strength from the
firetruck.  We need to find the source
of your strength."
451,BEN,451,"How bad is it?  You know I used to
smoke."
452,REED,452,"Okay, this might smart a little."
453,REED (CONT'D),453,We'll...continue this later.
454,REED,454,"Back it down, Johnny!"
455,JOHNNY,455,I can go hotter!
456,JOHNNY (CONT'D),456,You're really cramping my style here.
457,SUE,457,"You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter,
you're approaching supernova --"
458,JOHNNY,458,Sweet.
459,SUE,459,That's the temperature of the sun.
460,REED,460,"Not only could you kill yourself, but
you could set fire to Earth's
atmosphere and destroy all human life
as we know it."
461,JOHNNY,461,Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
462,SUE,462,He cooked the equipment.
463,REED,463,"Okay.  I've uh, got some questions,
from Sue.  That she thought might be
better coming from me... Can you, you
know, go to the bathroom...like
normal..."
464,BEN,464,Yeah.
465,BEN,465,You don't wanna know the details.
466,REED,466,"Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --"
467,BEN,467,"Not unless you want that clipboard
stretched up your --"
468,REED,468,O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
469,REED,469,"Is there something about flames?
About flaming, that you --"
470,JOHNNY,470,"What are you trying to say?  Just
because I dress well and like to dance --"
471,REED,471,"What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out
why we each ended up with different
symptoms."
472,JOHNNY,472,"Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot.
You're...well, you're a little limp.
Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's
always been a hardass."
473,JOHNNY,473,Why aren't you writing this down?
474,REED,474,"It's not ""invisibility"" per se.
You're bending the light around you
with some kind of malleable force
field.  That's what you projected on
the Bridge."
475,SUE,475,"What about you?  You haven't eaten in
days.  How come you're never on this
side of the microscope?"
476,SUE (CONT'D),476,Bruises...from the bridge?
477,REED,477,"Have you had any side-effects, from
your powers?"
478,SUE,478,I've had some headaches.  Migraines.
479,REED,479,"You should be able to bend light
around other objects, even people, if
you could control your emotional state
better --"
480,SUE,480,Excuse me?
481,REED,481,"I'm saying, if you had a little more
self control, you could locate the
trigger.  Can you remember the exact
emotions when --"
482,SUE,482,Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
483,REED,483,"Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate
that feeling?  Some memory or..."
484,SUE,484,I'm sure I can come up with something.
485,REED,485,How's that coming -- whoa --
486,SUE,486,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
do that... You must think that was
some kind of latent hostility or --"
487,REED,487,"What in the world would give me that
idea?"
488,REED (CONT'D),488,"I mean, you broke up with me, right?"
489,SUE,489,Are you kidding?
490,REED,490,"No, I distinctly remember: you walked
out my door.  Ergo..."
491,SUE,491,"Reed.  I was ready for the next step,
you weren't, ergo, I walked."
492,REED,492,"I think it was a little more
complicated than --"
493,SUE,493,"I just wanted to share an apartment.
What was so complicated about that?"
494,REED,494,"There were a lot of variables to
consider --"
495,SUE,495,"No.  There weren't.  There was you.
And me.  No variables, no math.  It
was actually the simplest thing in the
world.  But your head got in the way...
like it always does."
496,REED,496,Sue...I just...I thought...
497,SUE,497,Same old Reed.  Too much thinking...
498,JOHNNY,498,"Okay guys, we have a serious problem."
499,REED (V.O.),499,"Our uniforms were exposed to the storm
like us.  So they can transform like
us, becoming invisible, changing size
on demand or remaining impervious to
flame."
500,BEN,500,You look like an eighties rock band.
501,SUE,501,"The suit will stretch.  You should try
it --"
502,BEN,502,I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
503,JOHNNY,503,"He's right.  These costumes are...
missing something.  I can't put my
finger on it --"
504,REED,504,They're not costumes.
505,SUE,505,"We're not taking them out.  Johnny, we
need to stay here till we've stabilized."
506,JOHNNY,506,"I'm getting sick of being trapped
here.  NASA wasn't even this strict!"
507,BEN,507,Maybe it's missing a utility belt.
508,VICTOR (V.O.),508,So what's the prognosis?
509,DOCTOR,509,"Your tissue, your organs, your entire
biophysical structure is changing.
Every system is still functioning,
somehow --"
510,VICTOR,510,And they're changing into...
511,DOCTOR,511,"I don't really know.  A compound
organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than
titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than
diamonds --"
512,VICTOR,512,"Like the shields Reed said would
protect us."
513,VICTOR,513,How long?
514,DOCTOR,514,"At this rate, the infection should be
complete in two, maybe three weeks --"
515,VICTOR,515,"What do you mean ""complete""?"
516,DOCTOR,516,"I wish I could tell you.  I can't
pretend to know what we're dealing
with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --"
517,VICTOR,517,What?
518,DOCTOR,518,"The Center for Disease Control.  If
this thing is contagious --"
519,VICTOR,519,"Look at me.  I have a life.  I'm the
face of a billion-dollar-company... We
need to keep this confidential,
understand?"
520,DOCTOR,520,"But...this disease...is progressive...
degenerative..."
521,VICTOR,521,That's terrible news...
522,VICTOR (CONT'D),522,"...but I think I'll get a second
opinion."
523,REED,523,Nothing...nothing...nothing...
524,REED (CONT'D),524,Of course...of course...the cloud...
525,SUE,525,What are you doing?
526,REED,526,"The plants, from space.  Their
particles are still charged.  With the
right amount of energy, those ions
could create the elemental profile of
the cosmic storm."
527,REED,527,"If we can build a machine to re-create
the storm, we can reverse the polarity --"
528,SUE,528,And reverse the mutations --
529,REED,529,"Curing countless diseases, not just
ours."
530,SUE,530,"But we're the focus, right Reed?
Reed...?"
531,REED,531,Of course.  Of course.
532,SUE,532,"And you sure you can control this
thing?  Last time didn't work out so
well."
533,REED,533,"With the right energy, we can
stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into
the city grid..."
534,SUE,534,You really need to get a janitor.
535,SUE (CONT'D),535,"This must be what it looks like inside
your head."
536,REED,536,There's a system to it.
537,REED (CONT'D),537,"Wait!  Sue, don't touch tha--"
538,SUE,538,"Sorry.  My fault.  I won't...touch
anything."
539,LEONARD,539,Is Reed any closer to a cure?
540,VICTOR,540,"The only thing he's closer to is
Sue..."
541,VICTOR (CONT'D),541,"Make me a reservation for two at
Cipriani tonight."
542,VICTOR (CONT'D),542,And get this over to Ben Grimm.
543,WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.),543,"Close your eyes, baby.  Keep 'em
closed."
544,WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.),544,You surprised?
545,BEN (ON SCREEN),545,"Yeah I'm surprised.  Surprised the
fire department didn't shut this down."
546,THE THING,546,God.  I was good looking.
547,DEBBIE (ON SCREEN),547,"What did you wish for, honey?"
548,BEN (ON SCREEN),548,I already got it.  Everything I want.
549,VOICE (O.S.),549,"Damn, Stretch!"
550,JOHNNY,550,How far's that rubber bend?
551,REED,551,"That's what I'm trying to calculate.
And it's not rubber.  It's muscle,
tendon.  I seem to have the ability to
manipulate the malleability of my
molecular structure and redistribute
my density to --"
552,JOHNNY,552,"Right, whatever, have fun."
553,BEN,553,That's not funny!
554,ERNIE,554,"Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first
mook from Brooklyn to go to outer
space, so pay him some respect!"
555,BEN,555,"Ernie.  Sorry for killing your
business.  I'll take the usual, then
I'm out... Better make it a double."
556,ALICIA,556,Who killed the party?
557,ERNIE (O.S.),557,"Make it a triple.  On the house,
Benny."
558,BEN,558,"If there's a God, she hates me."
559,ALICIA,559,I don't think She's real big on hate.
560,BEN,560,"You wouldn't say that, if you could
see me."
561,ALICIA,561,Can I...?  See you...?
562,ALICIA (CONT'D),562,"It's okay, I won't bite..."
563,ALICIA (CONT'D),563,...not that I could.
564,ALICIA (CONT'D),564,"Such a sad face... You know, sometimes
being different isn't a bad thing."
565,BEN,565,"Trust me, this ain't one of those
times."
566,ALICIA,566,"See you round, Benny..."
567,ALICIA (CONT'D),567,"I'm Alicia, by the way."
568,VICTOR,568,Thank you for coming out to see me.
569,SUE,569,You said it was urgent.
570,VICTOR,570,"It is.  There's something we need to
talk about.  Something I need to ask
you..."
571,SUE,571,"Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I
want you to know I appreciate
everything you've done for me, but I
just don't --"
572,VICTOR,572,Susan.  What are you doing?
573,VICTOR (CONT'D),573,"You think I brought you here to talk
about us?  Please.  This is business."
574,VICTOR (CONT'D),574,"I need to know: how close is Reed
to finding to a cure?"
575,SUE,575,"He's working round the clock.  But the
data needs to be tested, analyzed
before --"
576,VICTOR,576,"Same old Reed.  All analysis, no
action.  Wasn't that the problem with
you two?"
577,SUE,577,"If these molecules aren't stable, they
could make us worse, maybe even kill
us."
578,VICTOR,578,"Then why is Reed dragging his feet?
Maybe he likes having his prize
specimen under glass..."
579,VICTOR,579,"It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally
the perfect woman for him...because
you're his science project."
580,SUE,580,Please don't make this personal --
581,VICTOR,581,"Oh, I think you already have."
582,SUE,582,"Victor, we can't do anything until the
research is ready."
583,VICTOR,583,"""We,"" huh?"
584,VICTOR (CONT'D),584,"Don't forget who you work for, Susan.
So get to work.  And do your job."
585,BUSINESSMAN,585,I wish my wife would disappear.
586,X GAMES ANNOUNCER (V.O.),586,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have
a special guest for you... Johnny
Storm of the Fantastic Four!"
587,JOHNNY,587,"Hey, Ronnie Renner!  I'm a big fan."
588,KENNY BARTRAM,588,"Heard you like to ride.  Wanna take
her for a spin?"
589,RONNIE RENNER,589,"Come on, bro.  I'll teach you some
tricks...if you can keep up."
590,X GAMES ANNOUNCER,590,A rock-solid double-flip!
591,X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D),591,"Look at that lift, ladies and
gentlemen!"
592,X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D),592,"Frontside 360!  He's totally flat and
whipped!"
593,X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D),593,"Whoa!  That's a...what is that?  A
720?"
594,X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D),594,He's going for a Kiss of Death!
595,X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D),595,Is he......flying?
596,X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D),596,"Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen!
You've just seen the first...the
first...TORCHFLIGHT!  The McTORCH!"
597,JOHNNY,597,My bad.  Sorry about that.
598,JOHNNY,598,"Thanks for the lesson, bro."
599,SUE,599,That's new...
600,SUE (CONT'D),600,"Have you read these...?  From all
over.  People want us to fight crimes...
save their kids...solve their problems..."
601,SUE (CONT'D),601,"...when we can't even solve our
own."
602,SUE (CONT'D),602,Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
603,REED,603,"No way to know.  Without more
tests, experiments."
604,SUE,604,"We're not specimens, we're patients.
This isn't just another science
project to you, is it...?"
605,BEN (O.S.),605,NO...NO...NO FREAKIN' WAY!!
606,REED,606,BEN!  What?  What's going on!?
607,X GAMES REPORTER (ON TV),607,"So what can you tell us about the
outfit?"
608,JOHNNY (ON TV),608,"Not too much, but I will say that it's
all weather and no leather.  Kind of
Armani meets Astronaut."
609,SUE,609,He didn't.
610,BEN,610,"Oh, he did."
611,SUE,611,What did he do to the uniform?!
612,REED,612,He talked me into it.
613,X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV),613,So what are your superhero names?
614,JOHNNY (ON TV),614,"I go by the Human Torch.  The ladies
call me Torch."
615,X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV),615,What about the rest of the team?
616,JOHNNY (ON TV),616,"Uh, we call my sister the invisible
girl...the Invisible Girl."
617,SUE,617,Girl...?!
618,X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV),618,"That's easy to remember.  And Reed
Richards?  He's the leader.  So
what's he?  Mr. Fantastic?"
619,JOHNNY,619,"Well, I wouldn't say he's the leader."
620,BEN,620,Could be worse.
621,X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV),621,"What about this one?  What do you call
this Thing?"
622,JOHNNY,622,"That's it.  Just The Thing.  We would
have gone with The Rock, but it was
taken.  And ""Thing"" pretty much sums
it up."
623,BEN,623,Okay.  I'm gonna go kill him now.
624,REED,624,Ben!  Slow down a second and --
625,X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV),625,"Is it true what they say?  That he can
expand any part of his anatomy?"
626,JOHNNY (ON TV),626,"Actually, between us, I think he's got
some problems staying rigid."
627,REED,627,...wait for me...
628,X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV),628,"Which may explain why this woman's
not smiling."
629,SUE,629,I'm driving.
630,JOHNNY (ON TV),630,Dude.  That's my sister.
631,JOHNNY,631,Where's my ride?
632,JOHNNY (CONT'D),632,What the?!  Is that my --
633,JOHNNY (CONT'D),633,"You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles."
634,JOHNNY (CONT'D),634,What?!
635,SUE,635,"You gave us names?  What are you, the
""face"" of the Fantastic Four now?"
636,BEN,636,It's about to be a broken face.
637,REED,637,"This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need
to be careful until we're normal
again."
638,JOHNNY,638,"What if some of us don't want to be
""normal"" again?  We didn't all turn
into monsters like --"
639,BEN,639,Did you just --
640,BEN (CONT'D),640,"Okay, that's it, tinkerbell!  You want
to fly?  Fly."
641,JOHNNY,641,"Let's see if we can get blood from a
stone."
642,SUE,642,You two need a time-out.
643,JOHNNY,643,Blockhead started it!
644,SUE,644,"Damn it, Johnny."
645,REED,645,"You need to control yourself and think
before you --"
646,JOHNNY,646,"Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if
we got these gifts for a reason?  What
if we have some, you know...like,
calling?"
647,REED,647,"A higher calling like getting girls
and making money?"
648,JOHNNY,648,Is there any higher?
649,JOHNNY (CONT'D),649,"This is who we are Reed.  Accept it.
Or better yet: enjoy it."
650,SUE,650,Ben!  Slow down...
651,SUE (CONT'D),651,"He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny.
He's always been a hothead --"
652,BEN,652,It's not him.  It's them.
653,BEN,653,I can't live like this.
654,SUE,654,"Just give Reed a little more time.
You know how he works -- analyzing
every little step before he takes
one --"
655,BEN,655,It's easy for you to be patient.
656,SUE,656,"No, it's not.  I thought I was done
waiting for Reed... We're all in this
together now, Ben."
657,BEN,657,"Together?  Look at me, Susie.  You got
no idea what I'd give...to be
invisible.  Your nightmare...is my
dream."
658,NED CECIL,658,"This is how you ""turn things around""?
These freaks are on the front page and
your company's in the obituaries."
659,VICTOR,659,"I have a plan to use their publicity
for --"
660,NED CECIL,660,"Victor, stop.  The bank's lost enough
already.  This isn't a negotiation.
It's a notification.  We're pulling
out."
661,VICTOR,661,"You need to look long-term here.
Without risk, there's no --"
662,NED CECIL,662,"Reward.  We all know the sales
pitch, Vic.  And frankly, we're
done buying... Gentlemen."
663,NED CECIL,663,Hello...?
664,NED CECIL (CONT'D),664,"Von Doom?  Gave me a little shock.  No
hard feelings, right?  Nothing
personal."
665,NED CECIL (CONT'D),665,"You know, you could always move back
to Latvura, start fresh."
666,NED CECIL (CONT'D),666,"Maybe that's where you belong, back in
the ""old country."""
667,VICTOR,667,It's pronounced Latveria.
668,VICTOR,668,"This meeting's over, Ned."
669,NEWSCASTER (ON TV),669,"...the Fantastic Four put on quite a
show last night.  They landed in every
major headline in the northern
hemisphere.  In related news..."
670,NEWSCASTER (ON TV) (CONT'D),670,"Reports have surfaced that Von Doom
Industries may be filing for
bankruptcy.  You may remember that it
was Victor Von Doom who..."
671,LEONARD,671,"Sir, is everything okay?  What
happened to your...?"
672,VICTOR,672,Reed... He got what he wanted...
673,VICTOR,673,Everything he wanted...he took from me.
674,VICTOR (CONT'D),674,"Now I'm going to take it back.  Piece
by bloody piece..."
675,REED,675,"Victor, are you...are you okay?"
676,VICTOR,676,"Don't worry about me.  Worry about
yourself."
677,REED,677,What are you doing here?
678,VICTOR,678,"What I should have done a long time
ago.  Applications and patents, Reed.
This all belongs to me."
679,REED,679,But I'm not done with the machine --
680,VICTOR,680,"Which is precisely the point.
Analysis is over.  It's time for
action.  My men could have mass-
produced this by now."
681,REED,681,"Mass-produced?  This isn't a
toaster.  You have no idea how it
works."
682,VICTOR,682,"Re-create the storm, invert the
polarity here, reverse the mutation
there.  Don't talk to me like I'm some
schoolboy.  I've got the same Phd you
do."
683,REED,683,"The storm needs to be handled exactly
right, or it could make our mutations
worse, much worse, maybe even kill
us..."
684,REED (CONT'D),684,"Victor, please.  We need time to
verify the data... We can't afford any
mistakes -- there's only enough ions
for two or three attempts."
685,VICTOR,685,Reed.  I'm not asking permission.
686,VICTOR,686,"We'll build it, while you check the
specs."
687,SUE,687,Can I talk to you?
688,SUE,688,"Don't let Victor push you into making
a mistake --"
689,REED,689,"He was going to take away all my data,
equipment --"
690,SUE,690,"Better than your life.  Victor's not
the one who has to get into that
thing.  We are."
691,REED,691,"Which is why I'm working twenty hours
a day, checking every variable --"
692,SUE,692,"Every variable but yourself.  You
don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in
your head like --"
693,REED,693,"I'm not the only one in there.  I got
you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling
around in there."
694,SUE,694,"So clear it out.  Get out of your
head.  Get out of here..."
695,LITTLE GIRL,695,"Mister, Mister!  Please help me!  My
kitty is stuck in a tree."
696,LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D),696,Please save Miss Lucy.
697,BEN,697,Eyebrows are a little big...
698,VOICE (O.S.),698,"I figured the only way to get you here
was to stick that in the window."
699,BEN,699,How'd you know it was me?
700,ALICIA,700,"I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?"
701,BEN,701,I'm not really dressed for a party.
702,ALICIA,702,"Relax, it's casual."
703,BEN,703,"No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty..."
704,BEN,704,Those yours too?
705,ALICIA,705,"My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into
stone.  I was wondering when you'd
walk by."
706,THE THING,706,"You know, you could'a run an ad in the
personals."
707,ALICIA,707,"""Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton,
rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual
relationship."""
708,THE THING,708,"This ain't permanent.  My friend
Reed's working on a cure...I think."
709,ALICIA,709,Bennie.  You feel pretty good as is.
710,THE THING,710,"You don't know what it's like out
there.  Walking around like some kind
of circus freak.  People staring,
whispering --"
711,ALICIA,711,I wouldn't know anything about that.
712,THE THING,712,I mean...
713,ALICIA,713,"Tell me.  When you grew up in
Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you
know?"
714,ALICIA,714,"You went your own way then.  You
didn't listen to people.  So why start
now...?"
715,VICTOR,715,"Need a ride, Johnny?"
716,VICTOR,716,A few fans.  Hope you don't mind.
717,JOHNNY,717,"Gotta take care of the fans, right?"
718,VICTOR,718,"Look, I built my business knowing what
people want.  And right now, the
people want you."
719,JOHNNY,719,"And we don't want to let the people
down now, do we?"
720,VICTOR,720,"No we don't.  Which is why we need
to strike while the iron's hot.
I'm talking action figures,
videogames, sponsors --"
721,JOHNNY,721,Videogames?  You serious?
722,JOHNNY (CONT'D),722,You talk to Reed and Sue about this?
723,VICTOR,723,"Johnny.  Let's be honest here.  Ben,
Reed, Sue.  Good people, all.  But
stars?"
724,VICTOR,724,"I don't want to break up the band, but
you're the one they want.  Don't you
think it's time to go solo...?"
725,VICTOR (CONT'D),725,"Take the car for a spin.  Think about
it.  Is this the life you want?  Or
would you rather live in Reed's
lab...?"
726,REED,726,"I could get Ben to tap into the
Baxter's main power to generate enough
voltage --"
727,SUE,727,"Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look
up."
728,SUE (CONT'D),728,"Remember our first date here...?  God,
I was so nervous."
729,REED,729,You were?
730,SUE,730,"Of course I was.  I'd read all your
papers on bioethics.  Some of them two
times just so I'd have something to
say to you."
731,REED,731,"You know, I bribed the projectionist
ten bucks to keep it open late?"
732,SUE,732,I gave him twenty.
733,SUE (CONT'D),733,I didn't want that night to end.
734,REED,734,"Sue, you were right.  It wasn't
complicated.  I just wasn't ready to
be...to become..."
735,REED,735,You can be a little intimidating.
736,REED (CONT'D),736,"You always talked about how you liked
the kind of man who could approach
you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't
afraid to tell you what he wanted."
737,SUE,737,"I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted
you to be that man."
738,SUE (CONT'D),738,"When I walked out, I waited ten
minutes outside your door.  Ten.
Waiting for you to come find me."
739,REED,739,Why didn't you say something?
740,SUE,740,"That would have kinda defeated the
purpose.  And Reed..."
741,SUE,741,I'm saying it now.
742,SUE (CONT'D),742,Come find me.
743,SUE (O.S.) (CONT'D),743,"That's my nose, genius... These are my
lips."
744,ALICIA,744,"Look around.  I'll get us drinks.
They always let blind girls cut the
line."
745,PATRON,745,"I don't know about this one.  It lacks
a certain...realism."
746,BOHEMIAN GIRL #1,746,"She's always had a thing for runaways
and strays, but this is ridiculous."
747,BOHEMIAN GIRL #2,747,"I know.  Did she really think these
sculptures would sell?"
748,BOHEMIAN GIRL #1,748,"Like anybody would want this thing in
their house.  That girl's a one-woman
charity."
749,VICTOR (O.S.),749,This seat taken?
750,BEN,750,What are you doing here?
751,VICTOR,751,I'm worried about you.
752,BEN,752,About me?  How sweet.
753,VICTOR,753,"Come on.  Let me buy you something to
eat.  Looks like you could use the
company."
754,THE THING,754,'Scuse me.
755,VICTOR,755,"I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't
changed that much for Reed, Sue and
Johnny.  At least they can go out in
public.  But for you?  People staring.
Whispering behind your back..."
756,THE THING,756,"If you're trying to cheer me up you're
doing a helluva job --"
757,VICTOR,757,"I'm just saying, I know what it's like
to lose something you love.  To see it
slip away, and know it's never coming
back."
758,THE THING,758,Reed's gonna fix me up --
759,VICTOR,759,"For your sake I hope you're right.
I'm sorry if that sounds a little
skeptical."
760,THE THING,760,Skeptical...?
761,VICTOR,761,"Look, he's a brilliant man, we should
trust he's working as hard as he can.
You're his best friend.  So what
possible reason could he have for
taking his time?"
762,VICTOR,762,"I mean, other than getting close to
Sue?"
763,BEN,763,"Yeah, I have that effect on people."
764,REED,764,Ben --
765,BEN,765,"Oh, you remember my name do you?  You
happen to remember what you swore to
do with every breath in your body?"
766,REED,766,We're working as hard as we can --
767,BEN,767,Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
768,REED,768,"Come on, this is nothing."
769,BEN,769,"Glad ""nothing"" could take you away
from your work."
770,REED,770,"Ben, I don't know if this thing'll
change us back or make us worse.
I need you to be patient for a little
while longe--"
771,BEN,771,"Look at me, Reed.  Look at me!"
772,REED,772,"I am looking.  That's why I can't make
a mistake!  I've got to get it right,
and it's not right yet!  We need to
test this."
773,BEN,773,"I spent my whole life protecting you,
from the schoolyard to the stars.  For
what?  So you could play Twister with
your girlfriend while I'm the freak of
the week?"
774,SUE,774,Ben!  Stop it!  Or I'll stop it.
775,BEN,775,Stay out of this Susie.
776,BEN (CONT'D),776,"Good thing you're flexible enough to
watch your own back.  'Cause you're on
your own now."
777,REED,777,"I'm OK.  Just go, go after him.  Stop
him."
778,JOHNNY,778,Christmas come early!  Check it out!
779,BEN ACTION FIGURE,779,IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!
780,JOHNNY,780,Hey!  That's a prototype!
781,BEN,781,Go back to the drawing board.
782,SUE,782,Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
783,JOHNNY,783,"Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm
done with this freak show.  I'm moving
back to the real world."
784,SUE,784,"Is that what you call it?  ""Real""?"
785,JOHNNY,785,"At least it beats living in a lab like
somebody's science project."
786,SUE,786,"Johnny, slow down.  Think.  You know
mom didn't raise us to --"
787,JOHNNY,787,"Look around, sis!  She's not here.  So
you can stop talking to me like I'm
your little boy --"
788,SUE,788,"As soon as you stop acting like one.
Come on, you're smarter than this.
You think those people out there care
about you?  You're just a fad to them."
789,JOHNNY,789,"Let's try something new: you live
your life.  And I'll live mine."
790,JOHNNY,790,"And just for the record: they LOVE
me."
791,SUE,791,"Oh god, Reed."
792,SUE,792,"What did you do, Reed?  What did you
do?"
793,REED,793,I can...make it work.
794,SUE,794,"Reed, stop, you need to rest your --"
795,REED,795,"The power...I need...more power...to
control...the storm --"
796,SUE,796,You need a doctor.
797,VICTOR,797,More power...?
798,VICTOR (TO PHONE) (CONT'D),798,Leonard.  Bring me our lab rat.
799,LEONARD,799,"Ben!  They need you back at the Baxter
building.  It's...Reed."
800,JOHNNY,800,What do you say we get out of here?
801,JOHNNY (CONT'D),801,This your boyfriend?
802,BOYFRIEND,802,"Is that all you do?  Bar tricks and
stealing chicks..."
803,GIRLFRIEND,803,"What are you doing?!  You could have
burned somebody!"
804,GIRLFRIEND (CONT'D),804,"You know, if I had your power I'd be
doing something with it, not wasting
my time doing cheap bar tricks,
hitting on some other guy's girl."
805,VICTOR,805,"Ben, come in."
806,BEN,806,What is this?  Where's Reed?
807,VICTOR,807,Where do you think?  With Sue.
808,VICTOR (CONT'D),808,"I'll take it from here, Leonard."
809,LEONARD,809,Yes sir.
810,BEN,810,"What do you want, Vic?"
811,VICTOR,811,"To help you.  I've run every test
known to man.  And they all yield the
same result: the machine is ready."
812,BEN,812,Reed said it'd be weeks till --
813,VICTOR,813,"He also said we'd avoid that storm in
space.  And we know how that turned
out."
814,VICTOR (CONT'D),814,"He couldn't generate enough power for
the machine to reach critical mass.
Yet another mistake for ""Mr.
Fantastic."""
815,BEN,815,And you can?  Power it up?
816,VICTOR,816,Yes.  I've found a new energy source.
817,VICTOR (CONT'D),817,"Tell me...do you want to be Ben Grimm
again?"
818,BEN,818,Let's do it.
819,BEN,819,"Oh my God... Th-thank you.  THANK
YOU...VIC?!"
820,BEN (CONT'D),820,Vic... What the...?
821,DOOM,821,"Everyone thought I was safe behind
those shields..."
822,BEN,822,"Victor, the machine worked for me.  It
can work for you --"
823,DOOM,823,"It did, Ben.  It worked perfectly."
824,BEN,824,You planned this...?
825,DOOM,825,"I've always wanted power.  Now I've
got an unlimited supply..."
826,BEN,826,And no Thing to stand in your way.
827,DOOM,827,"Take a good look, Ben.  This is what a
man looks like who embraces his
destiny."
828,DOOM (CONT'D),828,"One down, three to go."
829,DOOM (CONT'D),829,Right on cue.
830,REED,830,Oh god Ben.  Are you okay?
831,REED,831,"You did it, you really did it..."
832,DOOM,832,"No, Reed.  I did."
833,REED,833,"Victor...?  What, what happened to
you?  What did you do to your --"
834,DOOM,834,"Exactly what I said I would: I built a
better, stronger being.  And
outsmarted the great Reed Richards --"
835,REED,835,"Victor, this isn't the way to --"
836,DOOM,836,"You always know best.  So tell me.
What happens when you superheat
rubber?"
837,O'HOOLIHAN,837,Mr. Von Doom?  Are you oka--
838,DOOM,838,"Never better, Jimmy.  And it's Doctor
Doom now."
839,DOOM,839,Why the long face?
840,SUE,840,Ben?!
841,JOHNNY (O.S.),841,Sue!
842,JOHNNY (CONT'D),842,"I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --"
843,SUE,843,"No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out."
844,JOHNNY,844,"Jesus, Ben!"
845,JOHNNY,845,"I go away, look what happens.  You got
a lot of explaining to do."
846,BEN,846,"The machine works.  And Vic's gone
Mister Hyde on us --"
847,JOHNNY,847,"Really?  With a name like Von Doom?
Never saw that one coming."
848,SUE,848,Where is Reed?
849,BEN,849,Victor must've taken him.
850,DOOM,850,"Chemistry 101, Part Two.  What
happens to rubber when it's super-
cooled?"
851,DOOM (CONT'D),851,Allow me.
852,DOOM (CONT'D),852,Painful...?
853,DOOM (CONT'D),853,"You don't know the meaning of the
word."
854,DOOM (CONT'D),854,But you will.
855,DOOM (CONT'D),855,Flame off.
856,JOHNNY,856,Great.  Heat-seeker.
857,SUE,857,What are you doing --
858,JOHNNY,858,"Sis.  Let me take care of you for
once."
859,SUE,859,But Johnny...you can't fly.
860,JOHNNY,860,"Well then this'll be one hell of a
basejump."
861,JOHNNY (CONT'D),861,Come on...come on...come on...
862,JOHNNY (CONT'D),862,FLAME ON.
863,BEN,863,We need to help Reed --
864,SUE,864,"Ben, you got what we all wanted.
You need to stay here.  It's too
dangerous."
865,BEN,865,What...what have I done?
866,SUE,866,What has he done to you?
867,DOOM (O.S.),867,How romantic.
868,SUE,868,"Victor, please --"
869,DOOM,869,It's Doctor Doom to you.
870,SUE,870,"We know the machine works.  It worked
on Ben, it'll work on you.  We can
turn you back --"
871,DOOM,871,"Do you really think fate turned us
into gods so we could refuse these
gifts?"
872,SUE,872,"Victor.  You always thought you were
god."
873,DOOM,873,"Sue please, let's not fight."
874,SUE,874,"No, Victor... Let's."
875,DOOM,875,Susan...... You're fired.
876,DOOM (CONT'D),876,Marco...
877,DOOM (CONT'D),877,Polo.
878,DOOM,878,"One more down.  Now it's just the
scientist and his specimen."
879,REED,879,"Sue.  The only thing I ever knew
without thinking was..."
880,REED,880,I...love...
881,SUE,881,"Me too, Reed."
882,DOOM,882,"And so four became none.  It's my time
now."
883,VOICE (O.S.),883,"Actually, Vic..."
884,BEN,884,IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!
885,BEN (CONT'D),885,"Damn, I've been wanting to do that."
886,BEN (CONT'D),886,"Victor's ""not that bad,"" huh?  Just ""a
little larger than life""?  Maybe
you'll listen to me next time before --"
887,BEN,887,"Excuse me, Maam.  Can I borrow your
car?"
888,OLD LADY,888,The clutch sticks a little.
889,BEN,889,Not gonna be a problem.
890,VOICE (O.S.),890,I can't let you do that.
891,DOOM,891,And you can't stop me.
892,DOOM (CONT'D),892,Hello Susan.
893,DOOM (CONT'D),893,What is this?  The pitiful three?
894,VOICE (O.S.),894,Four.
895,JOHNNY,895,"Had a little relapse, huh?"
896,JOHNNY (CONT'D),896,Welcome back.
897,DOOM,897,This is going to be fun.
898,REED,898,JOHNNY!  SPOT-WELD!
899,SUE,899,Can't...hold...on...
900,REED,900,Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
901,JOHNNY,901,But all these people...
902,REED,902,Now.
903,THING,903,"Flame on, kid."
904,REED,904,"Sue, I need some of that anger, rage,
frustration --"
905,SUE,905,I'm sure I can come up with something.
906,DOOM,906,"Is that the best you can do...?  A
little heat...?"
907,REED,907,"Time for your lesson, Vic.  Chem 101:
what happens when you supercool hot
metal...?"
908,REED,908,Ben...
909,BEN,909,"Got it, teach."
910,DOOM,910,No.
911,JOHNNY,911,"Damn, I love this job."
912,BEN,912,"Job, huh...?"
913,REED,913,"Well, we do have the suits..."
914,SUE,914,"You know, about what we said up there,
I think maybe --"
915,BEN,915,"Funny how things turn out, isn't it?"
916,SUE,916,Hilarious.
917,JOHNNY (O.S.),917,"Dude, that's still my sister."
918,REED,918,"Ben, I've been crunching the numbers
on the machine.  I think if we can
rework the power settings..."
919,BEN,919,"Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is."
920,ALICIA (O.S.),920,That's my Benny.
921,ALICIA (CONT'D),921,"We're going to have to work on your
touch."
922,BEN,922,I like the sound of that.
923,REED,923,"Sue, can I talk to you for a second?"
924,REED,924,"I found a broken gasket, from space --"
925,SUE,925,"A gasket?  Reed, we're at a party."
926,REED,926,If one of us were to wear it...
927,SUE,927,Reed.  What are you doing?
928,REED,928,"No more thinking, no more variables...
Sue Storm...will you..."
929,REED,929,Sue?  Sue?  You there?
930,SUE (V.O.),930,Yes.
931,SUE (V.O.) (CONT'D),931,"That's my nose, genius... These are my
lips."
932,BEN,932,No more cracks about how I look.
933,JOHNNY,933,"Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now."
934,JOHNNY,934,"Clear the way, wide load coming
through."
935,BEN,935,Showoff.
