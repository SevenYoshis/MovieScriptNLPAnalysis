0,THREEPIO,0,"Did you hear that? They've shut down
the main reactor. We'll be destroyed
for sure. This is madness!"
1,THREEPIO,1,We're doomed!
2,THREEPIO,2,"There'll be no escape for the Princess
this time."
3,THREEPIO,3,What's that?
4,THREEPIO,4,"I should have known better than to
trust the logic of a half-sized
thermocapsulary dehousing assister..."
5,LUKE,5,"Hurry up! Come with me! What are you
waiting for?! Get in gear!"
6,THREEPIO,6,"Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?"
7,THREEPIO,7,At last! Where have you been?
8,THREEPIO,8,"They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do? We'll be
sent to the spice mine of Kessel or
smashed into who knows what!"
9,THREEPIO,9,"Wait a minute, where are you going?"
10,IMPERIAL OFFICER,10,"The Death Star plans are not in the
main computer."
11,VADER,11,"Where are those transmissions you
intercepted?"
12,VADER,12,What have you done with those plans?
13,REBEL OFFICER,13,"We intercepted no transmissions.
Aaah... This is a consular ship.
Were on a diplomatic mission."
14,VADER,14,"If this is a consular ship... were
is the Ambassador?"
15,VADER,15,"Commander, tear this ship apart until
you've found those plans and bring
me the Ambassador. I want her alive!"
16,TROOPER,16,There she is! Set for stun!
17,TROOPER,17,"She'll be all right. Inform Lord
Vader we have a prisoner."
18,THREEPIO,18,"Hey, you're not permitted in there.
It's restricted. You'll be deactivated
for sure.."
19,THREEPIO,19,"Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease! Now
come out before somebody sees you."
20,THREEPIO,20,"Secret mission? What plans? What are
you talking about? I'm not getting
in there!"
21,THREEPIO,21,I'm going to regret this.
22,CHIEF PILOT,22,There goes another one.
23,CAPTAIN,23,"Hold your fire. There are no life
forms. It must have been short-
circuited."
24,THREEPIO,24,"That's funny, the damage doesn't
look as bad from out here."
25,THREEPIO,25,Are you sure this things safe?
26,WOMAN,26,I've told you kids to slow down!
27,FIXER,27,"Did I hear a young noise blast through
here?"
28,CAMIE,28,It was just wormie on another rampage.
29,LUKE,29,Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?
30,LUKE,30,"I didn't know you were back! When
did you get in?"
31,BIGGS,31,"Just now. I wanted to surprise you,
hot shot. I thought you'd be here...
certainly didn't expect you to be
out working."
32,LUKE,32,"The Academy didn't change you
much...but you're back so soon? Hey,
what happened, didn't you get your
commission?"
33,BIGGS,33,"Of course I got it. Signed aboard
The Rand Ecliptic last week. First
mate Biggs Darklighter at your
service..."
34,BIGGS,34,"...I just came to say good-bye to
all you unfortunate landlocked
simpletons."
35,LUKE,35,"I almost forgot. There's a battle
going on! Right here in our system.
Come and look!"
36,DEAK,36,Not again! Forget it.
37,LUKE,37,There they are!
38,BIGGS,38,"That's no battle, hot shot... they're
just sitting there! Probably a
freighter-tanker refueling."
39,LUKE,39,"But there was a lot of firing
earlier..."
40,LUKE,40,"Hey, easy with those..."
41,CAMIE,41,"Don't worry about it, Wormie."
42,FIXER,42,"I keep telling you, the Rebellion is
a long way from here. I doubt if the
Empire would even fight to keep this
system. Believe me Luke, this planet
is a big hunk of nothing..."
43,LEIA,43,"Lord Vader, I should have known.
Only you could be so bold. The
Imperial Senate will not sit for
this, when they hear you've attacked
a diplomatic..."
44,VADER,44,"Don't play games with me, Your
Highness. You weren't on any mercy
mission this time. You passed directly
through a restricted system. Several
transmissions were beamed to this
ship by Rebel spies. I want to know
what happened to the plans they sent
you."
45,LEIA,45,"I don't know what you're talking
about. I'm a member of the Imperial
Senate on a diplomatic mission to
Alderaan..."
46,VADER,46,"You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...
and a traitor. Take her away!"
47,COMMANDER,47,"Holding her is dangerous. If word of
this gets out, it could generate
sympathy for the Rebellion in the
senate."
48,VADER,48,"I have traced the Rebel spies to
her. Now she is my only link to find
their secret base!"
49,COMMANDER,49,"She'll die before she tells you
anything."
50,VADER,50,"Leave that to me. Send a distress
signal and then inform the senate
that all aboard were killed!"
51,SECOND OFFICER,51,"Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship! And no
transmissions were made. An escape
pod was jettisoned during the
fighting, but no life forms were
aboard."
52,VADER,52,"She must have hidden the plans in
the escape pod. Send a detachment
down to retrieve them. See to it
personally, Commander. There'll be
no one to stop us this time."
53,COMMANDER,53,"Yes, sir."
54,THREEPIO,54,"How did I get into this mess? I really
don't know how. We seem to be made
to suffer. It's our lot in life."
55,THREEPIO,55,"I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen."
56,THREEPIO,56,What a desolate place this is.
57,THREEPIO,57,Where are you going?
58,THREEPIO,58,"Well, I'm not going that way. It's
much too rocky. This way is much
easier."
59,THREEPIO,59,"What makes you think there are
settlements over there?"
60,THREEPIO,60,Don't get technical with me.
61,THREEPIO,61,"What mission? What are you talking
about? I've had just about enough of
you! Go that way! You'll be
malfunctioning within a day, you
nearsighted scrap pile!"
62,THREEPIO,62,"And don't let me catch you following
me begging for help, because you
won't get it."
63,THREEPIO,63,"No more adventures. I'm not going
that way."
64,THREEPIO,64,"That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault! He tricked me
into going this way, but he'll do no
better."
65,THREEPIO,65,"Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm
saved!"
66,THREEPIO,66,"Over here! Help! Please, help!"
67,LUKE,67,"...so I cut off my power, shut down
the afterburners and came in low on
Deak's trail. I was so close I thought
I was going to fry my instruments.
As it was I busted up the Skyhopper
pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty
upset. He grounded me for the rest
of the season. You should have been
there... it was fantastic."
68,BIGGS,68,"You ought to take it easy Luke. You
may be the hottest bushpilot this
side of Mos Eisley, but those little
Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it
up, and one day, whammo, you're going
to be nothing more than a dark spot
on the down side of a canyon wall."
69,LUKE,69,"Look who's talking. Now that you've
been around those giant starships
you're beginning to sound like my
uncle. You've gotten soft in the
city..."
70,BIGGS,70,I've missed you kid.
71,LUKE,71,"Well, things haven't been the same
since you left, Biggs. It's been
so... quiet."
72,BIGGS,72,"Luke, I didn't come back just to say
good-bye... I shouldn't tell you
this, but you're the only one I can
trust... and if I don't come back, I
want somebody to know."
73,LUKE,73,What are you talking about?
74,BIGGS,74,I made some friends at the Academy.
75,BIGGS,75,"...when our frigate goes to one of
the central systems, we're going to
jump ship and join the Alliance..."
76,LUKE,76,"Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding!
How?"
77,BIGGS,77,"Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth
bigger than a meteor crater!"
78,LUKE,78,I'm sorry. I'm quiet.
79,LUKE,79,"Listen how quiet I am. You can barely
hear me..."
80,BIGGS,80,"My friend has a friend on Bestine
who might help us make contact."
81,LUKE,81,"You're crazy! You could wander around
forever trying to find them."
82,BIGGS,82,"I know it's a long shot, but if I
don't find them I'll do what I can
on my own... It's what we always
talked about. Luke, I'm not going to
wait for the Empire to draft me into
service. The Rebellion is spreading
and I want to be on the right side --
the side I believe in."
83,LUKE,83,And I'm stuck here...
84,BIGGS,84,"I thought you were going to the
Academy next term. You'll get your
chance to get off this rock."
85,LUKE,85,"Not likely! I had to cancel my
application. There has been a lot of
unrest among the Sandpeople since
you left... they've even raided the
outskirts of Anchorhead."
86,BIGGS,86,"Your uncle could hold off a whole
colony of Sandpeople with one blaster."
87,LUKE,87,"I know, but he's got enough vaporators
going to make the place pay off. He
needs me for just one more season. I
can't leave him now."
88,BIGGS,88,"I feel for you, Luke, you're going
to have to learn what seems to be
important or what really is important.
What good is all your uncle's work
if it's taken over by the Empire?...
You know they're starting to
nationalize commerce in the central
systems... it won't be long before
your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving
for the greater glory of the Empire."
89,LUKE,89,"It couldn't happen here. You said it
yourself. The Empire won't bother
with this rock."
90,BIGGS,90,Things always change.
91,LUKE,91,"I wish I was going... Are you going
to be around long?"
92,BIGGS,92,"No, I'm leaving in the morning..."
93,LUKE,93,Then I guess I won't see you.
94,BIGGS,94,Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.
95,LUKE,95,"Well, I'll be at the Academy next
season... after that who knows. I
won't be drafted into the Imperial
Starfleet that's for sure... Take
care of yourself, you'll always be
the best friend I've got."
96,BIGGS,96,"So long, Luke."
97,THREEPIO,97,Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!
98,FIRST TROOPER,98,"Someone was in the pod. The tracks
go off in this direction."
99,SECOND TROOPER,99,"Look, sir -- droids."
100,THREEPIO,100,Wake up! Wake up!
101,THREEPIO,101,We're doomed.
102,THREEPIO,102,Do you think they'll melt us down?
103,THREEPIO,103,"Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this
never end?"
104,BERU,104,"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a
translator to be sure it speaks Bocce."
105,LUKE,105,"It looks like we don't have much of
a choice but I'll remind him."
106,OWEN,106,I have no need for a protocol droid.
107,THREEPIO,107,"Sir -- not in an environment such as
this -- that's why I've also been
programmed for over thirty secondary
functions that..."
108,OWEN,108,"What I really need is a droid that
understands the binary language of
moisture vaporators."
109,THREEPIO,109,"Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was
programming binary load lifter...
very similar to your vaporators. You
could say..."
110,OWEN,110,Do you speak Bocce?
111,THREEPIO,111,"Of course I can, sir. It's like a
second language for me... I'm as
fluent in Bocce..."
112,OWEN,112,All right shut up!
113,OWEN,113,I'll take this one.
114,THREEPIO,114,"Shutting up, sir."
115,OWEN,115,"Luke, take these two over to the
garage, will you? I want you to have
both of them cleaned up before dinner."
116,LUKE,116,"But I was going into Toshi Station
to pick up some power converters..."
117,OWEN,117,"You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done. Now come
on, get to it!"
118,LUKE,118,"All right, come on! And the red one,
come on. Well, come on, Red, let's
go."
119,LUKE,119,Uncle Owen...
120,OWEN,120,Yeah?
121,LUKE,121,"This R2 unit has a bad motivator.
Look!"
122,OWEN,122,"Hey, what're you trying to push on
us?"
123,THREEPIO,123,"Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is
in prime condition. A real bargain."
124,LUKE,124,Uncle Owen...
125,OWEN,125,Yeah?
126,LUKE,126,What about that one?
127,OWEN,127,"What about that blue one? We'll take
that one."
128,LUKE,128,"Yeah, take it away."
129,THREEPIO,129,"Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very
pleased with that one, sir. He really
is in first-class condition. I've
worked with him before. Here he comes."
130,LUKE,130,"Okay, let's go."
131,THREEPIO,131,"Now, don't you forget this! Why I
should stick my neck out for you is
quite beyond my capacity!"
132,THREEPIO,132,"Thank the maker! This oil bath is
going to feel so good. I've got such
a bad case of dust contamination, I
can barely move!"
133,LUKE,133,"It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is
right. I'm never gonna get out of
here!"
134,THREEPIO,134,Is there anything I might do to help?
135,LUKE,135,"Well, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest, or teleport me
off this rock!"
136,THREEPIO,136,"I don't think so, sir. I'm only a
droid and not very knowledgeable
about such things. Not on this planet,
anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm
not even sure which planet I'm on."
137,LUKE,137,"Well, if there's a bright center to
the universe, you're on the planet
that it's farthest from."
138,THREEPIO,138,"I see, sir."
139,LUKE,139,"Uh, you can call me Luke."
140,THREEPIO,140,"I see, sir Luke."
141,LUKE,141,Just Luke.
142,THREEPIO,142,"And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg
relations, and this is my counterpart,
Artoo-Detoo."
143,LUKE,143,Hello.
144,LUKE,144,"You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
It looks like you boys have seen a
lot of action."
145,THREEPIO,145,"With all we've been through, sometimes
I'm amazed we're in as good condition
as we are, what with the Rebellion
and all."
146,LUKE,146,"You know of the Rebellion against
the Empire?"
147,THREEPIO,147,"That's how we came to be in your
service, if you take my meaning,
sir."
148,LUKE,148,Have you been in many battles?
149,THREEPIO,149,"Several, I think. Actually, there's
not much to tell. I'm not much more
than an interpreter, and not very
good at telling stories. Well, not
at making them interesting, anyways."
150,LUKE,150,"Well, my little friend, you've got
something jammed in here real good.
Were you on a cruiser or..."
151,LEIA,151,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my
only hope."
152,LUKE,152,What's this?
153,THREEPIO,153,"What is what?!? He asked you a
question..."
154,THREEPIO,154,What is that?
155,LEIA,155,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my
only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope."
156,THREEPIO,156,"Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely
a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no
mind."
157,LUKE,157,Who is she? She's beautiful.
158,THREEPIO,158,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir."
159,LEIA,159,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi..."
160,THREEPIO,160,"I think she was a passenger on our
last voyage. A person of some
importance, sir -- I believe. Our
captain was attached to..."
161,LUKE,161,Is there more to this recording?
162,THREEPIO,162,"Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going
to get us in trouble. It's all right,
you can trust him. He's our new
master."
163,THREEPIO,163,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
Kenobi, a resident of these parts.
And it's a private message for him.
Quite frankly, sir I don't know what
he's talking about. Our last master
was Captain Antilles, but with what
we've been through, this little R2
unit has become a bit eccentric."
164,LUKE,164,"Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means
old Ben Kenobi?"
165,THREEPIO,165,"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you
know what he's talking about?"
166,LUKE,166,"Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-
Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond
the dune sea. He's kind of a strange
old hermit."
167,LUKE,167,"I wonder who she is. It sounds like
she's in trouble. I'd better play
back the whole thing."
168,THREEPIO,168,"He says the restraining bolt has
short circuited his recording system.
He suggests that if you remove the
bolt, he might be able to play back
the entire recording."
169,LUKE,169,"H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're
too small to run away on me if I
take this off! Okay."
170,LUKE,170,There you go.
171,LUKE,171,"Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go?
Bring her back! Play back the entire
message."
172,THREEPIO,172,"What message? The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards!"
173,AUNT BERU,173,Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
174,LUKE,174,"All right, I'll be right there, Aunt
Beru."
175,THREEPIO,175,"I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to
have picked up a slight flutter."
176,LUKE,176,"Well, see what you can do with him.
I'll be right back."
177,THREEPIO,177,"Just you reconsider playing that
message for him."
178,THREEPIO,178,"No, I don't think he likes you at
all."
179,THREEPIO,179,"No, I don't like you either."
180,LUKE,180,"You know, I think that R2 unit we
bought might have been stolen."
181,OWEN,181,What makes you think that?
182,LUKE,182,"Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him. He says he
belongs to someone called Obi-Wan
Kenobi."
183,LUKE,183,"I thought he might have meant old
Ben. Do you know what he's talking
about? Well, I wonder if he's related
to Ben."
184,OWEN,184,"That old man's just a crazy old
wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take
that R2 unit into Anchorhead and
have its memory flushed. That'll be
the end of it. It belongs to us now."
185,LUKE,185,"But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking
for him?"
186,OWEN,186,"He won't, I don't think he exists
any more. He died about the same
time as your father."
187,LUKE,187,He knew my father?
188,OWEN,188,"I told you to forget it. Your only
concern is to prepare the new droids
for tomorrow. In the morning I want
them on the south ridge working out
those condensers."
189,LUKE,189,"Yes, sir. I think those new droids
are going to work out fine. In fact,
I, uh, was also thinking about our
agreement about my staying on another
season. And if these new droids do
work out, I want to transmit my
application to the Academy this year."
190,OWEN,190,"You mean the next semester before
harvest?"
191,LUKE,191,"Sure, there're more than enough
droids."
192,OWEN,192,"Harvest is when I need you the most.
Only one more season. This year we'll
make enough on the harvest so I'll
be able to hire some more hands. And
then you can go to the Academy next
year."
193,OWEN,193,"You must understand I need you here,
Luke."
194,LUKE,194,But it's a whole 'nother year.
195,OWEN,195,"Look, it's only one more season."
196,LUKE,196,"Yeah, that's what you said last year
when Biggs and Tank left."
197,AUNT BERU,197,Where are you going?
198,LUKE,198,"It looks like I'm going nowhere. I
have to finish cleaning those droids."
199,AUNT BERU,199,"Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone. It
means so much to him."
200,OWEN,200,"I'll make it up to him next year. I
promise."
201,AUNT BERU,201,"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He
has too much of his father in him."
202,OWEN,202,That's what I'm afraid of.
203,LUKE,203,What are you doing hiding there?
204,THREEPIO,204,"It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't
deactivate me. I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning;
kept babbling on about his mission."
205,LUKE,205,"Oh, no!"
206,THREEPIO,206,"That R2 unit has always been a
problem. These astro-droids are
getting quite out of hand. Even I
can't understand their logic at times."
207,LUKE,207,"How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere
in sight. Blast it!"
208,THREEPIO,208,"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go
after him?"
209,LUKE,209,"It's too dangerous with all the
Sandpeople around. We'll have to
wait until morning."
210,OWEN,210,"Luke, I'm shutting the power down
for the night."
211,LUKE,211,"All right, I'll be there in a few
minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it."
212,LUKE,212,"You know that little droid is going
to cause me a lot of trouble."
213,THREEPIO,213,"Oh, he excels at that, sir."
214,OWEN,214,"Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be
loafing now!"
215,OWEN,215,Have you seen Luke this morning?
216,AUNT BERU,216,"He said he had some things to do
before he started today, so he left
early."
217,OWEN,217,"Uh? Did he take those two new droids
with him?"
218,AUNT BERU,218,I think so.
219,OWEN,219,"Well, he'd better have those units
in the south range repaired be midday
or there'll be hell to pay!"
220,LUKE,220,How's that.
221,LUKE,221,"Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this
direction somewhere, but I don't see
how that R2 unit could have come
this far. We must have missed him.
Uncle Owen isn't going to take this
very well."
222,THREEPIO,222,"Sir, would it help if you told him
it was my fault."
223,LUKE,223,"Sure. He needs you. He'd probably
only deactivate you for a day or
so..."
224,THREEPIO,224,"Deactivate! Well, on the other hand
if you hadn't removed his restraining
bolt..."
225,LUKE,225,"Wait, there's something dead ahead
on the scanner. It looks like our
droid... hit the accelerator."
226,LUKE,226,"Hey, whoa, just where do you think
you're going?"
227,THREEPIO,227,"Master Luke here is your rightful
owner. We'll have no more of this
Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't
talk to me about your mission, either.
You're fortunate he doesn't blast
you into a million pieces right here."
228,LUKE,228,"Well, come on. It's getting late. I
only hope we can get back before
Uncle Owen really blows up."
229,THREEPIO,229,"If you don't mind my saying so, sir,
I think you should deactivate the
little fugitive until you've gotten
him back to your workshop."
230,LUKE,230,"No, he's not going to try anything."
231,LUKE,231,What's wrong with him now?
232,THREEPIO,232,"Oh my... sir, he says there are
several creatures approaching from
the southeast."
233,LUKE,233,"Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's
have a look. Come on."
234,LUKE,234,"There are two Banthas down there but
I don't see any... wait a second,
they're Sandpeople all right. I can
see one of them now."
235,BEN,235,"Hello there! Come here my little
friend. Don't be afraid."
236,BEN,236,"Don't worry, he'll be all right."
237,LUKE,237,What happened?
238,BEN,238,"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy
day. You're fortunate you're still
in one piece."
239,LUKE,239,"Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to
see you!"
240,BEN,240,"The Jundland wastes are not to be
traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke,
what brings you out this far?"
241,LUKE,241,"Oh, this little droid! I think he's
searching for his former master...
I've never seen such devotion in a
droid before... there seems to be no
stopping him. He claims to be the
property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he
a relative of yours? Do you know who
he's talking about?"
242,BEN,242,"Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats
a name I haven't heard in a long
time... a long time."
243,LUKE,243,"I think my uncle knew him. He said
he was dead."
244,BEN,244,"Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet."
245,LUKE,245,You know him!
246,BEN,246,"Well of course, of course I know
him. He's me! I haven't gone by the
name Obi-Wan since oh, before you
were born."
247,LUKE,247,Then the droid does belong to you.
248,BEN,248,"Don't seem to remember ever owning a
droid. Very interesting..."
249,BEN,249,"I think we better get indoors. The
Sandpeople are easily startled but
they will soon be back and in greater
numbers."
250,LUKE,250,Threepio!
251,THREEPIO,251,"Where am I? I must have taken a bad
step..."
252,LUKE,252,"Can you stand? We've got to get out
of here before the Sandpeople return."
253,THREEPIO,253,"I don't think I can make it. You go
on, Master Luke. There's no sense in
you risking yourself on my account.
I'm done for."
254,LUKE,254,"No, you're not. What kind of talk is
that?"
255,BEN,255,"Quickly, son... they're on the move."
256,LUKE,256,"No, my father didn't fight in the
wars. He was a navigator on a spice
freighter."
257,BEN,257,"That's what your uncle told you. He
didn't hold with your father's ideals.
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved."
258,LUKE,258,You fought in the Clone Wars?
259,BEN,259,"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the
same as your father."
260,LUKE,260,I wish I'd known him.
261,BEN,261,"He was the best star-pilot in the
galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I
understand you've become quite a
good pilot yourself. And he was a
good friend. Which reminds me..."
262,BEN,262,"I have something here for you. Your
father wanted you to have this when
you were old enough, but your uncle
wouldn't allow it. He feared you
might follow old Obi-Wan on some
damned-fool idealistic crusade like
your father did."
263,THREEPIO,263,"Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for awhile."
264,LUKE,264,"Sure, go ahead."
265,LUKE,265,What is it?
266,BEN,266,"Your fathers lightsaber. This is the
weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy
or as random as a blaster."
267,BEN,267,"An elegant weapon for a more civilized
time. For over a thousand generations
the Jedi Knights were the guardians
of peace and justice in the Old
Republic. Before the dark times,
before the Empire."
268,LUKE,268,How did my father die?
269,BEN,269,"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who
was a pupil of mine until he turned
to evil, helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi Knights. He
betrayed and murdered your father.
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
Vader was seduced by the dark side
of the Force."
270,LUKE,270,The Force?
271,BEN,271,"Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi
his power. It's an energy field
created by all living things. It
surrounds us and penetrates us. It
binds the galaxy together."
272,BEN,272,"Now, let's see if we can't figure
out what you are, my little friend.
And where you come from."
273,LUKE,273,I saw part of the message he was...
274,BEN,274,I seem to have found it.
275,LEIA,275,"General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars. Now he
begs you to help him in his struggle
against the Empire. I regret that I
am unable to present my father's
request to you in person, but my
ship has fallen under attack and I'm
afraid my mission to bring you to
Alderaan has failed. I have placed
information vital to the survival of
the Rebellion into the memory systems
of this R2 unit. My father will know
how to retrieve it. You must see
this droid safely delivered to him
on Alderaan. This is our most
desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan
Kenobi, you're my only hope."
276,BEN,276,"You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan."
277,LUKE,277,"Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.
I've got to go home. It's late, I'm
in for it as it is."
278,BEN,278,"I need your help, Luke. She needs
your help. I'm getting too old for
this sort of thing."
279,LUKE,279,"I can't get involved! I've got work
to do! It's not that I like the
Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing
I can do about it right now. It's
such a long way from here."
280,BEN,280,That's your uncle talking.
281,LUKE,281,"Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever
going to explain this?"
282,BEN,282,"Learn about the Force, Luke."
283,LUKE,283,"Look, I can take you as far as
Anchorhead. You can get a transport
there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're
going."
284,BEN,284,"You must do what you feel is right,
of course."
285,TAGGE,285,"Until this battle station is fully
operational we are vulnerable. The
Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
They're more dangerous than you
realize."
286,MOTTI,286,"Dangerous to your starfleet,
Commander, not to this battle station!"
287,TAGGE,287,"The Rebellion will continue to gain
a support in the Imperial Senate as
long as...."
288,TARKIN,288,"The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us. I've just
received word that the Emperor has
dissolved the council permanently.
The last remnants of the Old Republic
have been swept away."
289,TAGGE,289,"That's impossible! How will the
Emperor maintain control without the
bureaucracy?"
290,TARKIN,290,"The regional governors now have direct
control over territories. Fear will
keep the local systems in line. Fear
of this battle station."
291,TAGGE,291,"And what of the Rebellion? If the
Rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station,
it is possible, however unlikely,
that they might find a weakness and
exploit it."
292,VADER,292,"The plans you refer to will soon be
back in our hands."
293,MOTTI,293,"Any attack made by the Rebels against
this station would be a useless
gesture, no matter what technical
data they've obtained. This station
is now the ultimate power in the
universe. I suggest we use it!"
294,VADER,294,"Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've
constructed. The ability to destroy
a planet is insignificant next to
the power of the Force."
295,MOTTI,295,"Don't try to frighten us with your
sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your
sad devotion to that ancient religion
has not helped you conjure up the
stolen data tapes, or given you
clairvoyance enough to find the
Rebel's hidden fort..."
296,VADER,296,I find your lack of faith disturbing.
297,TARKIN,297,"Enough of this! Vader, release him!"
298,VADER,298,As you wish.
299,TARKIN,299,"This bickering is pointless. Lord
Vader will provide us with the
location of the Rebel fortress by
the time this station is operational.
We will then crush the Rebellion
with one swift stroke."
300,LUKE,300,"It looks like Sandpeople did this,
all right. Look, here are Gaffi
sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...
I never heard of them hitting anything
this big before."
301,BEN,301,"They didn't. But we are meant to
think they did. These tracks are
side by side. Sandpeople always ride
single file to hide there numbers."
302,LUKE,302,"These are the same Jawas that sold
us Artoo and Threepio."
303,BEN,303,"And these blast points, too accurate
for Sandpeople. Only Imperial
stormtroopers are so precise."
304,LUKE,304,"Why would Imperial troops want to
slaughter Jawas?"
305,LUKE,305,"If they traced the robots here, they
may have learned who they sold them
to. And that would lead them home!"
306,BEN,306,"Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous."
307,LUKE,307,Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!
308,VADER,308,"And, now Your Highness, we will
discuss the location of your hidden
Rebel base."
309,BEN,309,"There's nothing you could have done,
Luke, had you been there. You'd have
been killed, too, and the droids
would be in the hands of the Empire."
310,LUKE,310,"I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There's nothing here for me now. I
want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father."
311,BEN,311,"Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never
find a more wretched hive of scum
and villainy. We must be cautious."
312,TROOPER,312,How long have you had these droids?
313,LUKE,313,About three or four seasons.
314,BEN,314,They're for sale if you want them.
315,TROOPER,315,Let me see your identification.
316,BEN,316,"You don't need to see his
identification."
317,TROOPER,317,"We don't need to see his
identification."
318,BEN,318,"These are not the droids your looking
for."
319,TROOPER,319,"These are not the droids we're looking
for."
320,BEN,320,He can go about his business.
321,TROOPER,321,You can go about your business.
322,BEN,322,Move along.
323,TROOPER,323,Move along. Move along.
324,THREEPIO,324,"I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting
creatures."
325,LUKE,325,"Go on, go on. I can't understand how
we got by those troopers. I thought
we were dead."
326,BEN,326,"The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded. You will find it
a powerful ally."
327,LUKE,327,"Do you really think we're going to
find a pilot here that'll take us to
Alderaan?"
328,BEN,328,"Well, most of the best freighter
pilots can be found here. Only watch
your step. This place can be a little
rough."
329,LUKE,329,I'm ready for anything.
330,THREEPIO,330,"Come along, Artoo."
331,BARTENDER,331,We don't serve their kind here!
332,LUKE,332,What?
333,BARTENDER,333,"Your droids. They'll have to wait
outside. We don't want them here."
334,LUKE,334,"Listen, why don't you wait out by
the speeder. We don't want any
trouble."
335,THREEPIO,335,I heartily agree with you sir.
336,CREATURE,336,Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
337,HUMAN,337,He doesn't like you.
338,LUKE,338,I'm sorry.
339,HUMAN,339,I don't like you either.
340,HUMAN,340,"Don't insult us. You just watch
yourself. We're wanted men. I have
the death sentence in twelve systems."
341,LUKE,341,I'll be careful than.
342,HUMAN,342,You'll be dead.
343,BEN,343,"This little one isn't worth the
effort. Come let me buy you
something..."
344,BARTENDER,344,No blasters! No blaster!
345,BEN,345,"This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate
on a ship that might suit our needs."
346,THREEPIO,346,I don't like the look of this.
347,HAN,347,"Han Solo. I'm captain of the
Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells
me you're looking for passage to the
Alderaan system."
348,BEN,348,"Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship."
349,HAN,349,"Fast ship? You've never heard of the
Millennium Falcon?"
350,BEN,350,Should I have?
351,HAN,351,"It's the ship that made the Kessel
run in less than twelve parsecs!"
352,HAN,352,"I've outrun Imperial starships, not
the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
I'm talking about the big Corellian
ships now. She's fast enough for
you, old man. What's the cargo?"
353,BEN,353,"Only passengers. Myself, the boy,
two droids, and no questions asked."
354,HAN,354,"What is it? Some kind of local
trouble?"
355,BEN,355,"Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any Imperial entanglements."
356,HAN,356,"Well, that's the trick, isn't it?
And it's going to cost you something
extra. Ten thousand in advance."
357,LUKE,357,"Ten thousand? We could almost buy
our own ship for that!"
358,HAN,358,"But who's going to fly it, kid! You?"
359,LUKE,359,"You bet I could. I'm not such a bad
pilot myself! We don't have to sit
here and listen..."
360,BEN,360,"We haven't that much with us. But we
could pay you two thousand now, plus
fifteen when we reach Alderaan."
361,HAN,361,"Seventeen, huh!"
362,HAN,362,"Okay. You guys got yourself a ship.
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking bay Ninety-four."
363,BEN,363,Ninety-four.
364,HAN,364,"Looks like somebody's beginning to
take an interest in your handiwork."
365,TROOPER,365,"All right, we'll check it out."
366,HAN,366,"Seventeen thousand! Those guys must
really be desperate. This could really
save my neck. Get back to the ship
and get her ready."
367,BEN,367,You'll have to sell your speeder.
368,LUKE,368,"That's okay. I'm never coming back
to this planet again."
369,GREEDO,369,"Going somewhere, Solo?"
370,HAN,370,"Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I
was just going to see your boss.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money."
371,GREEDO,371,"It's too late. You should have paid
him when you had the chance. Jabba's
put a price on your head, so large
that every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you. I'm lucky I
found you first."
372,HAN,372,"Yeah, but this time I got the money."
373,GREEDO,373,"If you give it to me, I might forget
I found you."
374,HAN,374,I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...
375,GREEDO,375,"Jabba's through with you. He has no
time for smugglers who drop their
shipments at the first sign of an
Imperial cruiser."
376,HAN,376,"Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you
think I had a choice?"
377,GREEDO,377,"You can tell that to Jabba. He may
only take your ship."
378,HAN,378,Over my dead body.
379,GREEDO,379,"That's the idea. I've been looking
forward to killing you for a long
time."
380,HAN,380,"Yes, I'll bet you have."
381,HAN,381,Sorry about the mess.
382,VADER,382,"Her resistance to the mind probe is
considerable. It will be some time
before we can extract any information
from her."
383,IMPERIAL OFFICER,383,"The final check-out is complete. All
systems are operational. What course
shall we set?"
384,TARKIN,384,"Perhaps she would respond to an
alternative form of persuasion."
385,VADER,385,What do you mean?
386,TARKIN,386,"I think it is time we demonstrate
the full power of this station."
387,TARKIN,387,"Set your course for Princess Leia's
home planet of Alderaan."
388,TROOPER,388,With pleasure.
389,THREEPIO,389,"Lock the door, Artoo."
390,TROOPER,390,"All right, check that side of the
street. It's secure. Move on to the
next door."
391,THREEPIO,391,"I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.
I don't know what all the trouble is
about, but I'm sure it must be your
fault."
392,THREEPIO,392,You watch your language!
393,LUKE,393,"He says it's the best he can do.
Since the XP-38 came out, they're
just not in demand."
394,BEN,394,It will be enough.
395,BEN,395,"If the ship's as fast as he's
boasting, we ought to do well."
396,JABBA,396,"Come on out, Solo!"
397,HAN,397,"I've been waiting for you, Jabba."
398,JABBA,398,I expected you would be.
399,HAN,399,I'm not the type to run.
400,JABBA,400,"Han, my boy, there are times when
you disappoint me... why haven't you
paid me? And why did you have to fry
poor Greedo like that... after all
we've been through together."
401,HAN,401,You sent Greedo to blast me.
402,JABBA,402,"Han, why you're the best smuggler in
the business. You're too valuable to
fry. He was only relaying my concern
at your delays. He wasn't going to
blast you."
403,HAN,403,"I think he thought he was. Next time
don't send one of those twerps. If
you've got something to say to me,
come see me yourself."
404,JABBA,404,"Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to
dump that shipment of spice... you
understand I just can't make an
exception. Where would I be if every
pilot who smuggled for me dumped
their shipment at the first sign of
an Imperial starship? It's not good
business."
405,HAN,405,"You know, even I get boarded
sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice,
but I've got a charter now and I can
pay you back, plus a little extra. I
just need some more time."
406,JABBA,406,"Put your blasters away. Han, my boy,
I'm only doing this because you're
the best and I need you. So, for an
extra, say twenty percent I'll give
you a little more time... but this
is it. If you disappoint me again,
I'll put a price on your head so
large you won't be able to go near a
civilized system for the rest of
your short life."
407,HAN,407,"Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my
pleasure."
408,LUKE,408,What a piece of junk.
409,HAN,409,"She'll make point five beyond the
speed of light. She may not look
like much, but she's got it where it
counts, kid. I've added some special
modifications myself."
410,HAN,410,"We're a little rushed, so if you'll
hurry aboard we'll get out of here."
411,THREEPIO,411,"Hello, sir."
412,TROOPER,412,Which way?
413,TROOPER,413,"All right, men. Load your weapons!"
414,TROOPER,414,Stop that ship!
415,TROOPER,415,Blast 'em!
416,HAN,416,"Chewie, get us out of here!"
417,THREEPIO,417,"Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I
hate space travel."
418,HAN,418,"It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Our passengers must be hotter than I
thought. Try and hold them off. Angle
the deflector shield while I make
the calculations for the jump to
light speed."
419,HAN,419,"Stay sharp! There are two more coming
in; they're going to try to cut us
off."
420,LUKE,420,"Why don't you outrun them? I thought
you said this thing was fast."
421,HAN,421,"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
going to find yourself floating home.
We'll be safe enough once we make
the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I
know a few maneuvers. We'll lose
them!"
422,HAN,422,Here's where the fun begins!
423,BEN,423,"How long before you can make the
jump to light speed?"
424,HAN,424,"It'll take a few moments to get the
coordinates from the navi-computer."
425,LUKE,425,"Are you kidding? At the rate they're
gaining..."
426,HAN,426,"Traveling through hyperspace isn't
like dusting crops, boy! Without
precise calculations we could fly
right through a star or bounce too
close to a supernova and that'd end
your trip real quick, wouldn't it?"
427,LUKE,427,What's that flashing?
428,HAN,428,"We're losing our deflector shield.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to
make the jump to light speed."
429,MOTTI,429,We've entered the Alderaan system.
430,LEIA,430,"Governor Tarkin, I should have
expected to find you holding Vader's
leash. I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board."
431,TARKIN,431,"Charming to the last. You don't know
how hard I found it signing the order
to terminate your life!"
432,LEIA,432,"I surprised you had the courage to
take the responsibility yourself!"
433,TARKIN,433,"Princess Leia, before your execution
I would like you to be my guest at a
ceremony that will make this battle
station operational. No star system
will dare oppose the Emperor now."
434,LEIA,434,"The more you tighten your grip,
Tarkin, the more star systems will
slip through your fingers."
435,TARKIN,435,"Not after we demonstrate the power
of this station. In a way, you have
determined the choice of the planet
that'll be destroyed first. Since
you are reluctant to provide us with
the location of the Rebel base, I
have chosen to test this station's
destructive power... on your home
planet of Alderaan."
436,LEIA,436,"No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no
weapons. You can't possibly..."
437,TARKIN,437,"You would prefer another target? A
military target? Then name the system!"
438,TARKIN,438,"I grow tired of asking this. So it'll
be the last time. Where is the Rebel
base?"
439,LEIA,439,Dantooine.
440,LEIA,440,They're on Dantooine.
441,TARKIN,441,"There. You see Lord Vader, she can
be reasonable."
442,TARKIN,442,"Continue with the operation. You may
fire when ready."
443,LEIA,443,What?
444,TARKIN,444,"You're far too trusting. Dantooine
is too remote to make an effective
demonstration. But don't worry. We
will deal with your Rebel friends
soon enough."
445,LEIA,445,No!
446,VADER,446,Commence primary ignition.
447,LUKE,447,Are you all right? What's wrong?
448,BEN,448,"I felt a great disturbance in the
Force... as if millions of voices
suddenly cried out in terror and
were suddenly silenced. I fear
something terrible has happened."
449,BEN,449,"You'd better get on with your
exercises."
450,HAN,450,"Well, you can forget your troubles
with those Imperial slugs. I told
you I'd outrun 'em."
451,HAN,451,Don't everyone thank me at once.
452,HAN,452,"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about oh-two-hundred hours."
453,THREEPIO,453,"Now be careful, Artoo."
454,THREEPIO,454,"He made a fair move. Screaming about
it won't help you."
455,HAN,455,"Let him have it. It's not wise to
upset a Wookiee."
456,THREEPIO,456,"But sir, nobody worries about
upsetting a droid."
457,HAN,457,"That's 'cause droids don't pull
people's arms out of their socket
when they lose. Wookiees are known
to do that."
458,THREEPIO,458,"I see your point, sir. I suggest a
new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee
win."
459,BEN,459,"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him."
460,LUKE,460,You mean it controls your actions?
461,BEN,461,"Partially. But it also obeys your
commands."
462,HAN,462,"Hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match for a good blaster at
your side, kid."
463,LUKE,463,"You don't believe in the Force, do
you?"
464,HAN,464,"Kid, I've flown from one side of
this galaxy to the other. I've seen
a lot of strange stuff, but I've
never seen anything to make me believe
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything. There's no
mystical energy field that controls
my destiny."
465,HAN,465,"It's all a lot of simple tricks and
nonsense."
466,BEN,466,"I suggest you try it again, Luke."
467,BEN,467,"This time, let go your conscious
self and act on instinct."
468,LUKE,468,"With the blast shield down, I can't
even see. How am I supposed to fight?"
469,BEN,469,"Your eyes can deceive you. Don't
trust them."
470,BEN,470,Stretch out with your feelings.
471,BEN,471,"You see, you can do it."
472,HAN,472,I call it luck.
473,BEN,473,"In my experience, there's no such
thing as luck."
474,HAN,474,"Look, going good against remotes is
one thing. Going good against the
living? That's something else."
475,HAN,475,"Looks like we're coming up on
Alderaan."
476,LUKE,476,"You know, I did feel something. I
could almost see the remote."
477,BEN,477,"That's good. You have taken your
first step into a larger world."
478,TARKIN,478,Yes.
479,OFFICER CASS,479,"Our scout ships have reached
Dantooine. They found the remains of
a Rebel base, but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems."
480,TARKIN,480,She lied! She lied to us!
481,VADER,481,"I told you she would never consciously
betray the Rebellion."
482,TARKIN,482,Terminate her... immediately!
483,HAN,483,"Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in
the sublight engines."
484,HAN,484,"What the...? Aw, we've come out of
hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Some kind of asteroid collision.
It's not on any of the charts."
485,LUKE,485,What's going on?
486,HAN,486,"Our position is correct, except...
no, Alderaan!"
487,LUKE,487,What do you mean? Where is it?
488,HAN,488,"Thats what I'm trying to tell you,
kid. It ain't there. It's been totally
blown away."
489,LUKE,489,What? How?
490,BEN,490,Destroyed... by the Empire!
491,HAN,491,"The entire starfleet couldn't destroy
the whole planet. It'd take a thousand
ships with more fire power than
I've..."
492,HAN,492,There's another ship coming in.
493,LUKE,493,Maybe they know what happened.
494,BEN,494,It's an Imperial fighter.
495,LUKE,495,It followed us!
496,BEN,496,No. It's a short range fighter.
497,HAN,497,"There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?"
498,LUKE,498,"It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us, we're in big
trouble."
499,HAN,499,"Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam
it's transmissions."
500,BEN,500,"It'd be as well to let it go. It's
too far out of range."
501,HAN,501,Not for long...
502,BEN,502,"A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own."
503,LUKE,503,"It must have gotten lost, been part
of a convoy or something."
504,HAN,504,"Well, he ain't going to be around
long enough to tell anyone about us."
505,LUKE,505,"Look at him. He's headed for that
small moon."
506,HAN,506,"I think I can get him before he gets
there... he's almost in range."
507,BEN,507,That's no moon! It's a space station.
508,HAN,508,It's too big to be a space station.
509,LUKE,509,I have a very bad feeling about this.
510,HAN,510,"Yeah, I think your right. Full
reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary
power."
511,LUKE,511,Why are we still moving towards it?
512,HAN,512,"We're caught in a tractor beam! It's
pulling us in!"
513,LUKE,513,"But there's gotta be something you
can do!"
514,HAN,514,"There's nothin' I can do about it,
kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to
have to shut down. But they're not
going to get me without a fight!"
515,BEN,515,"You can't win. But there are
alternatives to fighting."
516,OFFICER,516,To you stations!
517,OFFICER,517,Come with me.
518,OFFICER,518,"Close all outboard shields! Close
all outboard shields!"
519,TARKIN,519,Yes.
520,VOICE,520,"We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.
It's markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos
Eisley."
521,VADER,521,"They must be trying to return the
stolen plans to the princess. She
may yet be of some use to us."
522,VOICE,522,"Unlock one-five-seven and nine.
Release charges."
523,OFFICER,523,"There's no one on board, sir.
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.
It must be a decoy, sir. Several of
the escape pods have been jettisoned."
524,VADER,524,Did you find any droids?
525,OFFICER,525,"No, sir. If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned."
526,VADER,526,"Send a scanning crew on board. I
want every part of this ship checked."
527,OFFICER,527,"Yes, sir."
528,VADER,528,"I sense something... a presence I
haven't felt since..."
529,OFFICER,529,"Get me a scanning crew in here on
the double. I want every part of
this ship checked!"
530,LUKE,530,"Boy, it's lucky you had these
compartments."
531,HAN,531,"I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in
them. This is ridiculous. Even if I
could take off, I'd never get past
the tractor beam."
532,BEN,532,Leave that to me!
533,HAN,533,"Damn fool. I knew that you were going
to say that!"
534,BEN,534,"Who's the more foolish... the fool
or the fool who follows him?"
535,TROOPER,535,"The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it
immediately. All right, let's go."
536,HAN'S VOICE,536,"Hey down there, could you give us a
hand with this?"
537,GANTRY OFFICER,537,"TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at
your post? TX-four-one-two, do you
copy?"
538,GANTRY OFFICER,538,"Take over. We've got a bad
transmitter. I'll see what I can do."
539,LUKE,539,"You know, between his howling and
your blasting everything in sight,
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here."
540,HAN,540,"Bring them on! I prefer a straight
fight to all this sneaking around."
541,THREEPIO,541,"We found the computer outlet, sir."
542,BEN,542,"Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire Imperial computer
network."
543,THREEPIO,543,"He says he's found the main computer
to power the tractor beam that's
holding the ship here. He'll try to
make the precise location appear on
the monitor."
544,THREEPIO,544,"The tractor beam is coupled to the
main reactor in seven locations. A
power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave."
545,BEN,545,"I don't think you boys can help. I
must go alone."
546,HAN,546,"Whatever you say. I've done more
that I bargained for on this trip
already."
547,LUKE,547,I want to go with you.
548,BEN,548,"Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch
over the droids."
549,LUKE,549,But he can...
550,BEN,550,"They must be delivered safely or
other star systems will suffer the
same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny
lies along a different path than
mine. The Force will be with you...
always!"
551,HAN,551,"Boy you said it, Chewie."
552,HAN,552,Where did you dig up that old fossil?
553,LUKE,553,Ben is a great man.
554,HAN,554,"Yeah, great at getting us into
trouble."
555,LUKE,555,I didn't hear you give any ideas...
556,HAN,556,"Well, anything would be better than
just hanging around waiting for him
to pick us up..."
557,LUKE,557,Who do you think...
558,LUKE,558,What is it?
559,THREEPIO,559,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
He says ""I found her"", and keeps
repeating, ""She's here."""
560,LUKE,560,"Well, who... who has he found?"
561,THREEPIO,561,Princess Leia.
562,LUKE,562,The princess? She's here?
563,HAN,563,Princess? What's going on?
564,THREEPIO,564,"Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-
three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to
be terminated."
565,LUKE,565,"Oh, no! We've got to do something."
566,HAN,566,What are you talking about?
567,LUKE,567,"The droid belongs to her. She's the
one in the message... We've got to
help her."
568,HAN,568,"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait right
here."
569,LUKE,569,"But he didn't know she was here.
Look, will you just find a way back
into the detention block?"
570,HAN,570,I'm not going anywhere.
571,LUKE,571,"They're going to execute her. Look,
a few minutes ago you said you didn't
want to just wait here to be captured.
Now all you want to do is stay."
572,HAN,572,"Marching into the detention area is
not what I had in mind."
573,LUKE,573,But they're going to kill her!
574,HAN,574,Better her than me...
575,LUKE,575,She's rich.
576,HAN,576,Rich?
577,LUKE,577,"Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you
were to rescue her, the reward would
be..."
578,HAN,578,What?
579,LUKE,579,Well more wealth that you can imagine.
580,HAN,580,"I don't know, I can imagine quite a
bit!"
581,LUKE,581,You'll get it!
582,HAN,582,I better!
583,LUKE,583,You will...
584,HAN,584,"All right, kid. But you'd better be
right about this."
585,LUKE,585,All right.
586,HAN,586,What's your plan?
587,LUKE,587,"Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders
there will you?"
588,LUKE,588,"Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on
you."
589,LUKE,589,"Okay. Han, you put these on."
590,HAN,590,"Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know
what he has in mind."
591,THREEPIO,591,"Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for
asking... but, ah... what should
Artoo and I do if we're discovered
here?"
592,LUKE,592,Lock the door!
593,HAN,593,And hope they don't have blasters.
594,THREEPIO,594,That isn't very reassuring.
595,LUKE,595,I can't see a thing in this helmet.
596,HAN,596,This is not going to work.
597,LUKE,597,Why didn't you say so before?
598,HAN,598,I did say so before!
599,OFFICER,599,Where are you taking this... thing?
600,LUKE,600,"Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-
three-eight."
601,OFFICER,601,"I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear
it."
602,HAN,602,Look out! He's loose!
603,LUKE,603,He's going to pull us all apart.
604,HAN,604,Go get him!
605,HAN,605,"We've got to find out which cell
this princess of yours is in. Here
it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.
You go get her. I'll hold them here."
606,HAN,606,"Everything is under control. Situation
normal."
607,INTERCOM VOICE,607,What happened?
608,HAN,608,"Uh... had a slight weapons
malfunction. But, uh, everything's
perfectly all right now. We're fine.
We're all fine here, now, thank you.
How are you?"
609,INTERCOM VOICE,609,We're sending a squad up.
610,HAN,610,"Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor
leak here now. Give us a few minutes
to lock it down. Large leak... very
dangerous."
611,INTERCOM VOICE,611,"Who is this? What's your operating
number?"
612,HAN,612,Boring conversation anyway.
613,HAN,613,Luke! We're going to have company!
614,LEIA,614,"Aren't you a little short to be a
stormtrooper?"
615,LUKE,615,"What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke
Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you."
616,LEIA,616,You're who?
617,LUKE,617,"I'm here to rescue you. I've got
your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben
Kenobi."
618,LEIA,618,Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?
619,LUKE,619,Come on!
620,VADER,620,He is here...
621,TARKIN,621,"Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think
so?"
622,VADER,622,"A tremor in the Force. The last time
I felt it was in the presence of my
old master."
623,TARKIN,623,Surely he must be dead by now.
624,VADER,624,"Don't underestimate the power of the
Force."
625,TARKIN,625,"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has
gone out of the universe. You, my
friend, are all that's left of their
religion."
626,TARKIN,626,Yes.
627,INTERCOM VOICE,627,"Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency
alert in detention block A A-twenty-
three."
628,TARKIN,628,"The princess! Put all sections on
alert!"
629,VADER,629,"Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with
him."
630,TARKIN,630,"If you're right, he must not be
allowed to escape."
631,VADER,631,"Escape is not his plan. I must face
him alone."
632,HAN,632,Chewie!
633,HAN,633,Get behind me! Get behind me!
634,HAN,634,Can't get out that way.
635,LEIA,635,"Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route."
636,HAN,636,"Maybe you'd like it back in your
cell, Your Highness."
637,LUKE,637,See-Threepio! See-Threepio!
638,THREEPIO,638,Yes sir?
639,LUKE,639,"We've been cut off! Are there any
other ways out of the cell bay?...
What was that? I didn't copy!"
640,THREEPIO,640,"I said, all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir. The main
entrance seems to be the only way in
or out; all other information on
your level is restricted."
641,TROOPER VOICE,641,Open up in there!
642,THREEPIO,642,"Oh, no!"
643,LUKE,643,There isn't any other way out.
644,HAN,644,"I can't hold them off forever! Now
what?"
645,LEIA,645,"This is some rescue. When you came
in here, didn't you have a plan for
getting out?"
646,HAN,646,"He's the brains, sweetheart."
647,LUKE,647,"Well, I didn't..."
648,HAN,648,What the hell are you doing?
649,LEIA,649,"Somebody has to save our skins. Into
the garbage chute, wise guy."
650,HAN,650,"Get in there you big furry oaf! I
don't care what you smell! Get in
there and don't worry about it."
651,HAN,651,"Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to
kill her or I'm beginning to like
her. Get in there!"
652,HAN,652,"Oh! The garbage chute was a really
wonderful idea. What an incredible
smell you've discovered! Let's get
out of here! Get away from there..."
653,LUKE,653,No! wait!
654,LUKE,654,"Will you forget it? I already tried
it. It's magnetically sealed!"
655,LEIA,655,"Put that thing away! You're going to
get us all killed."
656,HAN,656,"Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I
had everything under control until
you led us down here. You know, it's
not going to take them long to figure
out what happened to us."
657,LEIA,657,It could be worse...
658,HAN,658,It's worse.
659,LUKE,659,There's something alive in here!
660,HAN,660,That's your imagination.
661,LUKE,661,"Something just moves past my leg!
Look! Did you see that?"
662,HAN,662,What?
663,LUKE,663,Help!
664,HAN,664,Luke! Luke! Luke!
665,LEIA,665,Luke!
666,LEIA,666,"Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this."
667,LUKE,667,"Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed."
668,HAN,668,Where?
669,LUKE,669,Anywhere! Oh!!
670,HAN,670,Luke! Luke!
671,LEIA,671,Grab him!
672,LEIA,672,What happened?
673,LUKE,673,"I don't know, it just let go of me
and disappeared..."
674,HAN,674,"I've got a very bad feeling about
this."
675,LUKE,675,The walls are moving!
676,LEIA,676,"Don't just stand there. Try to brace
it with something."
677,LUKE,677,Wait a minute!
678,LUKE,678,"Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio!
Where could he be?"
679,FIRST TROOPER,679,Take over!
680,FIRST TROOPER,680,See to him! Look there!
681,THREEPIO,681,"They're madmen! They're heading for
the prison level. If you hurry, you
might catch them."
682,FIRST OFFICER,682,Follow me! You stand guard.
683,THREEPIO,683,Come on!
684,THREEPIO,684,"Oh! All this excitement has overrun
the circuits of my counterpart here.
If you don't mind, I'd like to take
him down to maintenance."
685,TROOPER,685,All right.
686,LUKE,686,"Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!"
687,HAN,687,Get to the top!
688,LEIA,688,I can't
689,LUKE,689,"Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio,
will you come in?"
690,THREEPIO,690,"They aren't here! Something must
have happened to them. See if they've
been captured."
691,THREEPIO,691,Hurry!
692,HAN,692,"One thing's for sure. We're all going
to be a lot thinner!"
693,HAN,693,Get on top of it!
694,LEIA,694,I'm trying!
695,THREEPIO,695,"Thank goodness, they haven't found
them! Where could they be?"
696,THREEPIO,696,"Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I
turned it off!"
697,THREEPIO,697,"Are you there, sir?"
698,LUKE,698,Threepio!
699,THREEPIO,699,We've had some problems...
700,LUKE,700,"Will you shut up and listen to me?
Shut down all garbage mashers on the
detention level, will you? Do you
copy?"
701,LUKE,701,"Shut down all the garbage mashers on
the detention level."
702,LUKE,702,"Shut down all the garbage mashers on
the detention level."
703,THREEPIO,703,No. Shut them all down! Hurry!
704,THREEPIO,704,"Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo!
Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast
enough. It's all my fault! My poor
master!"
705,LUKE,705,"Threepio, we're all right!"
706,LUKE,706,We're all right. You did great.
707,LUKE,707,"Hey... hey, open the pressure
maintenance hatch on unit number...
where are we?"
708,HAN,708,Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.
709,HAN,709,"If we can just avoid any more female
advice, we ought to be able to get
out of here."
710,LUKE,710,"Well, let's get moving!"
711,HAN,711,Where are you going?
712,LEIA,712,"No, wait. They'll hear!"
713,HAN,713,"Come here, you big coward!"
714,HAN,714,Chewie! Come here!
715,LEIA,715,"Listen. I don't know who you are, or
where you came from, but from now
on, you do as I tell you. Okay?"
716,HAN,716,"Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get
one thing straight! I take orders
from one person! Me!"
717,LEIA,717,It's a wonder you're still alive.
718,LEIA,718,"Will somebody get this big walking
carpet out of my way?"
719,HAN,719,No reward is worth this.
720,OFFICER,720,"Secure this area until the alert is
canceled."
721,FIRST TROOPER,721,Give me regular reports.
722,FIRST TROOPER,722,Do you know what's going on?
723,SECOND TROOPER,723,Maybe it's another drill.
724,SECOND TROOPER,724,What was that?
725,FIRST TROOPER,725,"Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about
it."
726,HAN,726,There she is.
727,LUKE,727,"See-Threepio, do you copy?"
728,THREEPIO,728,"For the moment. Uh, we're in the
main hangar across from the ship."
729,LUKE,729,We're right above you. Stand by.
730,LEIA,730,"You came in that thing? You're braver
that I thought."
731,HAN,731,Nice! Come on!
732,FIRST TROOPER,732,It's them! Blast them!
733,HAN,733,Get back to the ship!
734,LUKE,734,Where are you going? Come back!
735,LEIA,735,He certainly has courage.
736,LUKE,736,"What good will it do us if he gets
himself killed? Come on!"
737,LUKE,737,I think we took a wrong turn.
738,LEIA,738,There's no lock!
739,LUKE,739,That oughta hold it for a while.
740,LEIA,740,"Quick, we've got to get across. Find
the control that extends the bridge."
741,LUKE,741,"Oh, I think I just blasted it."
742,LEIA,742,They're coming through!
743,LUKE,743,"Here, hold this."
744,LEIA,744,Here they come!
745,LEIA,745,For luck!
746,THREEPIO,746,Where could they be?
747,TROOPER,747,Close the blast doors!
748,TROOPER,748,"Open the blast doors! Open the blast
doors!"
749,VADER,749,"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again, at last. The circle
is now complete."
750,VADER,750,"When I left you, I was but the
learner; now I am the master."
751,BEN,751,"Only a master of evil, Darth."
752,VADER,752,"Your powers are weak, old man."
753,BEN,753,"You can't win, Darth. If you strike
me down, I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine."
754,HAN,754,Didn't we just leave this party?
755,HAN,755,What kept you?
756,LEIA,756,We ran into some old friends.
757,LUKE,757,Is the ship all right?
758,HAN,758,"Seems okay, if we can get to it.
Just hope the old man got the tractor
beam out of commission."
759,LUKE,759,Look!
760,THREEPIO,760,"Come on, Artoo, we're going!"
761,HAN,761,Now's our chance! Go!
762,LUKE,762,No!
763,HAN,763,Come on!
764,LEIA,764,"Come on! Luke, its too late!"
765,HAN,765,Blast the door! Kid!
766,BEN'S VOICE,766,"Run, Luke! Run!"
767,HAN,767,"I hope the old man got that tractor
beam out if commission, or this is
going to be a real short trip. Okay,
hit it!"
768,HAN,768,"We're coming up on the sentry ships.
Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector
shields while I charge up the main
guns!"
769,LUKE,769,I can't believe he's gone.
770,LEIA,770,"There wasn't anything you could have
done."
771,HAN,771,"Come on, buddy, we're not out of
this yet!"
772,HAN,772,"You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!"
773,LEIA,773,Here they come!
774,LUKE,774,They're coming in too fast!
775,THREEPIO,775,Oooh!
776,LEIA,776,We've lost lateral controls.
777,HAN,777,"Don't worry, she'll hold together."
778,HAN,778,"You hear me, baby? Hold together!"
779,LUKE,779,Got him! I got him!
780,HAN,780,Great kid! Don't get cocky.
781,LEIA,781,"There are still two more of them out
there!"
782,LUKE,782,That's it! We did it!
783,LEIA,783,We did it!
784,THREEPIO,784,Help! I think I'm melting!
785,THREEPIO,785,This is all your fault.
786,TARKIN,786,Are they away?
787,VADER,787,"They have just made the jump into
hyperspace."
788,TARKIN,788,"You're sure the homing beacon is
secure aboard their ship? I'm taking
an awful risk, Vader. This had better
work."
789,HAN,789,"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You
know, sometimes I even amaze myself."
790,LEIA,790,"That doesn't sound too hard. Besides,
they let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our
escape."
791,HAN,791,Easy... you call that easy?
792,LEIA,792,Their tracking us!
793,HAN,793,"Not this ship, sister."
794,LEIA,794,"At least the information in Artoo is
still intact."
795,HAN,795,"What's so important? What's he
carrying?"
796,LEIA,796,"The technical readouts of that battle
station. I only hope that when the
data is analyzed, a weakness can be
found. It's not over yet!"
797,HAN,797,"It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't
in this for your revolution, and I'm
not in it for you, Princess. I expect
to be well paid. I'm in it for the
money!"
798,LEIA,798,"You needn't worry about your reward.
If money is all that you love, then
that's what you'll receive!"
799,LEIA,799,"Your friend is quite a mercenary. I
wonder if he really cares about
anything... or anyone."
800,LUKE,800,I care!
801,LUKE,801,"So... what do you think of her, Han?"
802,HAN,802,"I'm trying not to, kid!"
803,LUKE,803,Good...
804,HAN,804,"Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I
don't know, what do you think? Do
you think a princess and a guy like
me..."
805,LUKE,805,No!
806,WILLARD,806,You're safe! We had feared the worst.
807,WILLARD,807,"When we heard about Alderaan, we
were afraid that you were... lost
along with your father."
808,LEIA,808,"We don't have time for our sorrows,
Commander. The battle station has
surely tracked us here."
809,LEIA,809,"It's the only explanation for the
ease of our escape. You must use the
information in this R2 unit to plan
the attack. It is our only hope."
810,TARKIN,810,Yes.
811,DODONNA,811,"The battle station is heavily shielded
and carries a firepower greater than
half the star fleet. It's defenses
are designed around a direct large-
scale assault. A small one-man fighter
should be able to penetrate the outer
defense."
812,GOLD LEADER,812,"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what
good are snub fighters going to be
against that?"
813,DODONNA,813,"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a
small one-man fighter to be any
threat, or they'd have a tighter
defense. An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia has
demonstrated a weakness in the battle
station."
814,DODONNA,814,"The approach will not be easy. You
are required to maneuver straight
down this trench and skim the surface
to this point. The target area is
only two meters wide. It's a small
thermal exhaust port, right below
the main port. The shaft leads
directly to the reactor system. A
precise hit will start a chain
reaction which should destroy the
station."
815,DODONNA,815,"Only a precise hit will set up a
chain reaction. The shaft is ray-
shielded, so you'll have to use proton
torpedoes."
816,WEDGE,816,"That's impossible, even for a
computer."
817,LUKE,817,"It's not impossible. I used to bull's-
eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back
home. They're not much bigger than
two meters."
818,DODONNA,818,"Man your ships! And may the Force be
with you!"
819,VADER,819,"This will be a day long remembered.
It has seen the end of Kenobi and it
will soon see the end of the
Rebellion."
820,MAN'S VOICE,820,"All flight trooper, man your stations.
All flight troops, man your stations."
821,LUKE,821,"So... you got your reward and you're
just leaving then?"
822,HAN,822,"That's right, yeah! I got some old
debts I've got to pay off with this
stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't
think I'd be fool enough to stick
around here, do you? Why don't you
come with us? You're pretty good in
a fight. I could use you."
823,LUKE,823,"Come on! Why don't you take a look
around? You know what's about to
happen, what they're up against.
They could use a good pilot like
you. You're turning your back on
them."
824,HAN,824,"What good's a reward if you ain't
around to use it? Besides, attacking
that battle station ain't my idea of
courage. It's more like suicide."
825,LUKE,825,"All right. Well, take care of
yourself, Han. I guess that's what
you're best at, isn't it?"
826,HAN,826,"Hey, Luke... may the Force be with
you!"
827,HAN,827,"What're you lookin' at? I know what
I'm doing."
828,LEIA,828,What's wrong?
829,LUKE,829,"Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really
thought he'd change his mind."
830,LEIA,830,"He's got to follow his own path. No
one can choose it for him."
831,LUKE,831,I only wish Ben were here.
832,BIGGS,832,"Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you
get here... are you going out with
us?!"
833,LUKE,833,"Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there
with you! Listen, have I got some
stories to tell..."
834,RED LEADER,834,"Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you
been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-
five?"
835,BIGGS,835,"Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in
the outer rim territories."
836,RED LEADER,836,"I met your father once when I was
just a boy, he was a great pilot.
You'll do all right. If you've got
half of your father's skill, you'll
do better than all right."
837,LUKE,837,"Thank you, sir. I'll try."
838,BIGGS,838,"I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll
tell me your stories when we come
back. All right?"
839,LUKE,839,"I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs."
840,BIGGS,840,"You did, all right. It's going to be
like old times, Luke. We're a couple
of shooting stars that'll never be
stopped!"
841,CHIEF,841,"This R2 unit of your seems a bit
beat up. Do you want a new one?"
842,LUKE,842,"Not on your life! That little droid
and I have been through a lot
together."
843,LUKE,843,"You okay, Artoo?"
844,CHIEF,844,"Okay, easy she goes!"
845,THREEPIO,845,"Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to
come back."
846,THREEPIO,846,"You wouldn't want my life to get
boring, would you?"
847,BEN'S VOICE,847,"Luke, the Force will be with you."
848,MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE,848,"Stand-by alert. Death Star
approaching. Estimated time to firing
range, fifteen minutes."
849,RED LEADER,849,All wings report in.
850,RED TEN,850,Red Ten standing by.
851,RED SEVEN,851,Red Seven standing by.
852,BIGGS,852,Red Three standing by.
853,PORKINS,853,Red Six standing by.
854,RED NINE,854,Red Nine standing by.
855,WEDGE,855,Red Two standing by.
856,RED ELEVEN,856,Red Eleven standing by.
857,LUKE,857,Red Five standing by.
858,RED LEADER,858,Lock S-foils in attack position.
859,READ LEADER,859,"We're passing through their magnetic
field."
860,RED LEADER,860,Hold tight!
861,RED LEADER,861,Switch your deflectors on.
862,RED LEADER,862,Double front!
863,WEDGE,863,Look at the size of that thing!
864,RED LEADER,864,"Cut the chatter, Red Two."
865,RED LEADER,865,"Accelerate to attack speed. This is
it, boys!"
866,GOLD LEADER,866,"Red Leader, this is Gold Leader."
867,RED LEADER,867,"I copy, Gold Leader."
868,GOLD LEADER,868,"We're starting for the target shaft
now."
869,RED LEADER,869,"We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and try and draw
their fire."
870,WEDGE,870,"Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees."
871,RED LEADER,871,I see it. Stay low.
872,LUKE,872,This is Red Five; I'm going in!
873,BIGGS,873,"Luke, pull up!"
874,BIGGS,874,Are you all right?
875,LUKE,875,"I got a little cooked, but I'm okay."
876,ASTRO-OFFICER,876,"We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord
Vader. But they're so small they're
evading our turbo-lasers!"
877,VADER,877,"We'll have to destroy them ship to
ship. Get the crews to their fighters."
878,RED LEADER,878,"Luke, let me know when you're going
in."
879,LUKE,879,I'm on my way in now...
880,RED LEADER,880,"Watch yourself! There's a lot of
fire coming from the right side of
that deflection tower."
881,LUKE,881,I'm on it.
882,CONTROL OFFICER,882,"Squad leaders, we've picked up a new
group of signals. Enemy fighters
coming your way."
883,LUKE,883,"My scope's negative. I don't see
anything."
884,RED LEADER,884,"Keep up your visual scanning. With
all this jamming, they'll be on top
of you before your scope can pick
them up."
885,RED LEADER,885,"Biggs! You've picked one up... watch
it!"
886,BIGGS,886,I can't see it! Where is he?!
887,BIGGS,887,"He's on me tight, I can't shake him...
I can't shake him."
888,LUKE,888,"Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in."
889,LUKE,889,Got him!
890,VADER,890,"Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me!"
891,BIGGS,891,Pull in! Luke... pull in!
892,WEDGE,892,"Watch your back, Luke!"
893,WEDGE,893,"Watch your back! Fighter's above
you, coming in!"
894,LUKE,894,"I'm hit, but not bad."
895,LUKE'S VOICE,895,"Artoo, see what you can do with it.
Hang on back there."
896,RED LEADER,896,Red Six...
897,RED LEADER,897,Can you see Red Five?
898,RED TEN,898,"There's a heavy fire zone on this
side. Red Five, where are you?"
899,LUKE,899,I can't shake him!
900,WEDGE,900,"I'm on him, Luke!"
901,WEDGE,901,Hold on!
902,LUKE,902,Blast it! Wedge where are you?
903,LUKE,903,"Thanks, Wedge."
904,BIGGS,904,"Good shooting, Wedge!"
905,GOLD LEADER,905,Red Leader...
906,GOLD LEADER,906,"This is Gold Leader. We're starting
out attack run."
907,RED LEADER,907,"I copy, Gold Leader. Move into
position."
908,VADER,908,Stay in attack formation!
909,GOLD LEADER,909,The exhaust post is...
910,GOLD LEADER,910,...marked and locked in!
911,GOLD LEADER,911,"Switch power to front deflector
screens."
912,GOLD LEADER,912,"How many guns do you think, Gold
Five."
913,GOLD FIVE,913,"I'd say about twenty guns. Some on
the surface, some on the towers."
914,MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE,914,"Death Star will be in range in five
minutes."
915,GOLD LEADER,915,Switching to targeting computer.
916,GOLD TWO,916,Computer's locked. Getting a signal.
917,GOLD TWO,917,The guns... they've stopped!
918,GOLD FIVE,918,"Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch
for enemy fighters."
919,GOLD LEADER,919,"They've coming in! Three marks at
two ten."
920,VADER,920,I'll take them myself! Cover me!
921,WINGMAN'S VOICE,921,"Yes, sir."
922,GOLD LEADER,922,I can't maneuver!
923,GOLD FIVE,923,Stay on target.
924,GOLD LEADER,924,We're too close.
925,GOLD FIVE,925,Stay on target!
926,GOLD LEADER,926,Loosen up!
927,GOLD FIVE,927,Gold Five to Red Leader...
928,GOLD FIVE,928,"Lost Tiree, lost Dutch."
929,RED LEADER,929,"I copy, Gold Five."
930,GOLD FIVE,930,They came from behind...
931,OFFICER,931,"We've analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger. Should I have
your ship standing by?"
932,TARKIN,932,"Evacuate? In out moment of triumph?
I think you overestimate their
chances!"
933,VOICE,933,"Rebel base, three minutes and closing."
934,RED LEADER,934,"Red Group, this is Red Leader."
935,RED LEADER,935,Rendezvous at mark six point one.
936,WEDGE,936,This is Red Two. Flying toward you.
937,BIGGS,937,"Red Three, standing by."
938,DODONNA,938,"Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep
half your group out of range for the
next run."
939,RED LEADER'S VOICE,939,"Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two
and Three. Hold up here and wait for
my signal... to start your run."
940,RED LEADER,940,This is it!
941,RED TEN,941,We should be able to see it by now.
942,RED LEADER,942,"Keep your eyes open for those
fighters!"
943,RED TEN,943,There's too much interference!
944,RED TEN'S VOICE,944,"Red Five, can you see them from where
you are?"
945,LUKE,945,No sign of any... wait!
946,LUKE,946,Coming in point three five.
947,RED TEN,947,I see them.
948,RED LEADER,948,I'm in range.
949,RED LEADER,949,Target's coming up!
950,RED LEADER,950,Just hold them off for a few seconds.
951,VADER,951,Close up formation.
952,RED LEADER,952,Almost there!
953,RED TEN,953,I can't hold them!
954,RED LEADER,954,It's away!
955,RED NINE'S VOICE,955,It's a hit!
956,RED LEADER,956,Negative.
957,RED LEADER,957,"Negative! It didn't go in. It just
impacted on the surface."
958,LUKE,958,"Red Leader, we're right above you.
Turn to point..."
959,LUKE,959,...oh-five; we'll cover for you.
960,RED LEADER,960,Stay there...
961,RED LEADER,961,...I just lost my starboard engine.
962,RED LEADER,962,Get set to make your attack run.
963,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,963,"Rebel base, one minute and closing."
964,LUKE,964,"Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.
We're going in. We're going in full
throttle."
965,WEDGE,965,"Right with you, boss."
966,BIGGS,966,"Luke, at that speed will you be able
to pull out in time?"
967,LUKE,967,"It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon
back home."
968,BIGGS,968,"We'll stay back far enough to cover
you."
969,WEDGE,969,"My scope shows the tower, but I can't
see the exhaust port! Are you sure
the computer can hit it?"
970,LUKE,970,"Watch yourself! Increase speed full
throttle!"
971,WEDGE,971,What about the tower?
972,LUKE,972,"You worry about those fighters! I'll
worry about the tower!"
973,LUKE,973,"Artoo... that, that stabilizer's
broken loose again! See if you can't
lock it down!"
974,WEDGE,974,I'm hit! I can't stay with you.
975,LUKE,975,"Get clear, Wedge."
976,LUKE,976,You can't do any more good back there!
977,WEDGE,977,Sorry!
978,VADER,978,Let him go! Stay on the leader!
979,BIGGS,979,"Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much
faster this time. I can't hold them!"
980,LUKE,980,"Artoo, try and increase the power!"
981,BIGGS,981,"Hurry up, Luke!"
982,BIGGS,982,Wait!
983,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,983,"Rebel base, thirty seconds and
closing."
984,VADER,984,I'm on the leader.
985,THREEPIO,985,"Hang on, Artoo!"
986,BEN'S VOICE,986,"Use the Force, Luke."
987,BEN'S VOICE,987,"Let go, Luke."
988,VADER,988,The Force is strong with this one!
989,BEN'S VOICE,989,"Luke, trust me."
990,BASE VOICE,990,"His computer's off. Luke, you switched
off your targeting computer. What's
wrong?"
991,LUKE,991,Nothing. I'm all right.
992,LUKE,992,I've lost Artoo!
993,MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE,993,"The Death Star has cleared the planet.
The Death Star has cleared the planet."
994,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,994,"Rebel base, in range."
995,TARKIN,995,You may fire when ready.
996,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,996,Commence primary ignition.
997,VADER,997,I have you now.
998,VADER,998,What?
999,HAN,999,Yahoo!
1000,WINGMAN,1000,Look out!
1001,HAN,1001,"You're all clear, kid."
1002,HAN,1002,"Now let's blow this thing and go
home!"
1003,INTERCOM VOICE,1003,Stand by to fire at Rebel base.
1004,INTERCOM VOICE,1004,Standing by.
1005,HAN,1005,"Great shot, kid. That was one in a
million."
1006,BEN'S VOICE,1006,"Remember, the Force will be with
you... always."
1007,LEIA,1007,Luke! Luke! Luke!
1008,HAN,1008,Hey! Hey!
1009,LUKE,1009,"I knew you'd come back! I just knew
it!"
1010,HAN,1010,"Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward."
1011,LEIA,1011,"Hey, I knew there was more to you
than money."
1012,LUKE,1012,"Oh, no!"
1013,THREEPIO,1013,"Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say
something!"
1014,THREEPIO,1014,"You can repair him, can't you?"
1015,TECHNICIAN,1015,We'll get to work on him right away.
1016,THREEPIO,1016,"You must repair him! Sir, if any of
my circuits or gears will help, I'll
gladly donate them."
1017,LUKE,1017,He'll be all right.
