0,NURSE #1,0,She's not breathing!
1,SENIOR RESIDENT,1,Intubate her!
2,RESIDENT,2,Blood-pressure's forty and falling --
3,SENIOR RESIDENT,3,"Jesus, her water's broken --"
4,SENIOR RESIDENT,4,She's going into uterine contractions --
5,DENNIS,5,So where we going?
6,RAQUEL,6,It's a surprise.
7,DENNIS,7,I likes surprises.
8,RAQUEL,8,"What do you have down there, little
man?"
9,DENNIS,9,Heat-seeker.
10,RAQUEL,10,I'll bet.
11,DENNIS,11,What the fuck are we doing here?
12,DENNIS,12,"Fuck, I need a drink!!!"
13,RAQUEL,13,"What's wrong, baby?"
14,BLADE,14,Where is Deacon Frost?
15,BLADE,15,Got something in your throat.
16,QUINN,16,"Fuck you, Day-walker, I ain't saying
shit --"
17,BLADE,17,Frost.
18,QUINN,18,"You won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's
rising, the Sleeper's gonna --"
19,DENNIS,19,Please don't --
20,ASSISTANT,20,"Brought you a baked potato, nice
and crispy. Still warm, too."
21,CURTIS,21,"Jesus, that's rank --"
22,CURTIS,22,What's his story?
23,ASSISTANT,23,"Paramedics said he was still screaming
when they found him. Looks like some
joker had stapled him to a wall."
24,CURTIS,24,Pretty.
25,KAREN,25,You took this off a DOA?
26,KAREN,26,This isn't human blood.
27,CURTIS,27,Then what is it?
28,KAREN,28,I don't know --
29,KAREN,29,Look at this blood smear --
30,KAREN,30,"The red blood cells are biconvex,
which is theoretically impossible.
They're hypochromic, there's virtually
no hemoglobin in them."
31,KAREN,31,"Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated,
they should be mononucleated."
32,CURTIS,32,What about the chemistry panel?
33,JULIE,33,"Blood sugar level is three times the
norm, phosphorous and uric acid are
off the scales."
34,JULIE,34,"Like the woman said, impossible."
35,KAREN,35,"Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm
really not in the mood for one of your
practical jokes."
36,CURTIS,36,"It's not a joke. I've got the stiff
sitting in the morgue right now --
look, just come up and see him, okay?
Five minutes, that's all I ask."
37,KAREN,37,"I thought you promised to give me some
distance?"
38,CURTIS,38,"This is purely professional curiosity,
Karen, I swear."
39,KAREN,39,"Five minutes, not a second more. And I
don't want to hear a word about ""us""."
40,CURTIS,40,No problem.
41,KAREN,41,"You haven't started in on the internal
organs?"
42,CURTIS,42,"Just the blood sample from the
pericardial sac."
43,CURTIS,43,That's weird --
44,KAREN,44,What?
45,CURTIS,45,"He looks different now, burns are less
extreme, some of these wounds have
closed up --"
46,CURTIS,46,"Tell me something, honestly, you ever
have second thoughts about us?"
47,KAREN,47,Sometimes --
48,KAREN,48,"-- but then I remember what an
ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back
to reality."
49,CURTIS,49,"Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart
here --"
50,QUINN,50,-- more -- blood --
51,BLADE,51,Now don't we look dapper?
52,UNIFORM #1,52,"Hold it, ass-hole!"
53,UNIFORM #1,53,I said hold it!!!
54,KAREN,54,My shoulder -- dislocated --
55,BLADE,55,Whistler!
56,WHISTLER (O.S.),56,Are we bringing home strays now?
57,BLADE,57,She's been bitten.
58,WHISTLER,58,"You should've killed her, then."
59,BLADE,59,She hasn't turned yet.
60,BLADE,60,You can help her.
61,WHISTLER,61,"No promises. You watch her close. She
starts to turn, you finish her off."
62,WHISTLER,62,"Localized necrosis. She's borderline.
Another hour and she'd be well into
the change."
63,WHISTLER,63,"Can you hear me, woman?"
64,KAREN,64,What -- ?
65,WHISTLER,65,"You've been bitten by a vampire. We've
got to try and burn out the venom,
just like a rattlesnake bite --"
66,WHISTLER,66,Hold her.
67,WHISTLER,67,"""Dr. Karen Jansen"". Listen close, I'm
going to inject you with an antidote
made from allium setivum -- garlic.
This is going to hurt. A lot."
68,DRAGONETTI,68,"Blade. Once again, our interests have
fallen victim to his ridiculous
crusade. He must be destroyed."
69,FROST (O.S.),69,"You're wrong, Dragonetti."
70,FROST,70,"The Day Walker represents a unique
opportunity. We'd be fools to waste
it by killing him."
71,DRAGONETTI,71,"Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our
language, you insult the House of
Erebus by using the humans'
gutter-tongue, have you no respect
for tradition?"
72,FROST,72,"Why should I respect something which
has outlived its purpose?"
73,DRAGONETTI,73,"I see. And what would you have us do
with this ""half-breed""?"
74,FROST,74,"Study him. Unlock the secrets of his
DNA. He's the key we've been looking
for."
75,DRAGONETTI,75,He is an abomination!
76,FROST,76,"Why should we spend our lives
cringing from the daylight when his
blood offers us an alternative?
Enough talk. It's time we stepped out
of the shadows!"
77,PALLINTINE,77,"You're out of line, Frost."
78,FROST,78,"Am I? Or am I just the first to say
out loud what we've all been
thinking?"
79,DRAGONETTI,79,"The shadows suit us, Frost. We've
existed this way for thousands of
years. Who are you to challenge our
ways?"
80,FROST,80,"Someone who's sick of living off
scraps. The coming age belongs to us,
not the humans!"
81,FROST,81,"When the final war between our races
comes, who do you want leading the
charge?"
82,FROST,82,"Some withered up fossil ready to snap
like a brittle bone at the first sign
of change?"
83,DRAGONETTI,83,Get out!!!
84,FROST,84,"Careful, old fang. You might wake up
one day and find yourself extinct."
85,WHISTLER,85,"I had to increase the dose. You're
building up a resistance to the
serum --"
86,BLADE,86,"Just do it, old man."
87,BLADE,87,You shouldn't be here.
88,KAREN,88,"I'm sorry, I --"
89,WHISTLER (O.S.),89,"Wandered off the beaten path, Doctor?"
90,KAREN,90,Who are you people?
91,WHISTLER,91,My name is Abraham Whistler.
92,WHISTLER,92,"This is Blade. As for our little
homunculus here --"
93,BLADE,93,-- he's a vampire.
94,KAREN,94,You're joking --
95,WHISTLER,95,"Not at all. You're looking at a prime
specimen of the homines nocturna."
96,WHISTLER,96,"If Blade hadn't brought you here, you
would've wound up like him."
97,KAREN,97,Why did you help me?
98,BLADE,98,Stupidity.
99,WHISTLER,99,"Maybe not. I did some checking, she's
a hematologist. Knowledge like that
might come in handy."
100,BLADE,100,"It's not worth the risk. We can't
trust her."
101,KAREN,101,Why?
102,BLADE,102,"Because you're tainted. The venom's
still inside you. You could still
turn on us."
103,KAREN,103,What happens then?
104,BLADE,104,"Then I have to take you out, just
like any other bloodsucker."
105,BLADE,105,"We hunt them, moving from one city to
the next, tracking their migrations.
They're hard to kill. They tend to
regenerate."
106,KAREN,106,"So what do you use, then? A stake?"
107,WHISTLER,107,"Some of the old wives' tales are true
-- they're severely allergic to
silver, various types of wood. Feed
them garlic and they'll go into
anaphylactic shock --"
108,WHISTLER,108,"-- and of course there's always
sunlight, ultra-violet rays."
109,KAREN,109,"And you honestly expect me to believe
all this?"
110,BLADE,110,"I don't care what you believe. I
saved your life once, I don't plan on
making a habit of it. You want my
advice, you'll be out of the city by
nightfall. If you're stupid enough to
stay, that's your business."
111,KAREN,111,"I can't just leave. I have a life
here, a career --"
112,BLADE,112,"Not anymore. You've seen one of them.
You won't be allowed to live after
that."
113,WHISTLER,113,"There's a war going on out there.
Blade, myself, a few others -- we've
tried to keep it from spilling over
onto the streets."
114,WHISTLER,114,"Sometimes people like yourself get
caught in the cross-fire."
115,KAREN,115,"I can go to the police. I have blood
samples back at the hospital. I can
show them."
116,BLADE,116,"Do it. You'll be dead before you can
file the complaint."
117,KAREN,117,"That's ridiculous! No one's that
powerful."
118,WHISTLER,118,"You're talking about a brotherhood
that predates the Catholic Church by
thousands of years. Their survival
depends on their ability to blend in.
Chances are, you've encountered them
and not even known it. On the subway,
in a bar --"
119,BLADE,119,Get in. YouÂ’re leaving.
120,WHISTLER,120,Wait.
121,WHISTLER,121,"Consider it a parting gift. Vampire
mace -- silver nitrate, essence of
garlic."
122,KAREN,122,"So that's it? You guys just patch me
up and send me on my way?"
123,WHISTLER,123,"There is one other thing. I'd buy
yourself a gun if I were you. If you
start becoming sensitive to the
daylight, if you start becoming
thirsty regardless of much you've had
to drink -- then I suggest you take
that gun and use it on yourself.
Better that, than the alternative."
124,DRAGONETTI (O.S.),124,What are you doing here?
125,DRAGONETTI,125,"These archives are restricted to
members of the House of Erebus."
126,FROST,126,"Please. You and the other Elders
wouldn't know what to do with these
texts if your lives depended on it."
127,FROST,127,"Which, of course, they do."
128,DRAGONETTI,128,"You're wasting your time, Frost. Far
greater scholars than you have tried
to decipher these words. Whatever
secrets they hold have been lost."
129,FROST,129,Perhaps.
130,DRAGONETTI,130,"What are you up to, Frost?"
131,FROST'S VOICE,131,"Wouldn't you like to know, Old Fang?"
132,BLADE,132,"Remember what we said. Keep your eyes
open. They're everywhere."
133,KAREN,133,"I need the police. This is an
emergency --"
134,KAREN,134,"Hello? My name is Karen Jansen, I was
with Curtis Webb at Mid-Town Hospital
last night -- that's right, I
witnessed the attack --"
135,KAREN,135,"115 Aurora, apartment 3G. Yes, I'll
wait here. Please hurry."
136,KAREN,136,"Get a grip on yourself, girl."
137,KAREN,137,Who is it?
138,GIDEON,138,"Sergeant Gideon. I'm responding to a
911 call."
139,KAREN,139,"Yes, that was me, I'm Karen Jansen --"
140,GIDEON,140,Are you all right?
141,GIDEON,141,"I'm glad you called, Ms. Jansen, we've
been anxious to get a hold of you. You
disappeared on us for a while."
142,KAREN,142,"I know. Listen -- do you have any idea
what happened to Curtis, the other
doctor?"
143,GIDEON,143,"Oh, he's dead. But I wouldn't worry
about that if I were you."
144,KAREN,144,Why?
145,GIDEON,145,Because you're dead too.
146,GIDEON,146,Garlic?
147,KAREN,147,"He said it would work against
vampires --"
148,GIDEON,148,Who said I was a vampire?
149,GIDEON,149,"Thanks for the laugh. You can shut
your eyes if you want to."
150,BLADE,150,You okay?
151,KAREN,151,How did you know?
152,BLADE,152,"Figured they'd send someone after you.
Thought I'd wait around and see who
showed up."
153,KAREN,153,You used me as bait?!
154,BLADE,154,"It worked, didn't it?"
155,KAREN,155,"But, he could've --"
156,BLADE,156,He didn't. Get over it.
157,KAREN,157,But he's a policeman --
158,BLADE,158,"He's a familiar. A human who works for
the vampires. See this mark?"
159,BLADE,159,"That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire
cattle brand. That means Officer
Friendly here is someone's property.
Any of the other vampire's try to
bleed him, they'll have to answer to
Friendly's owner --"
160,BLADE,160,"This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost.
We've been tracking him for a while
now --"
161,KAREN,161,"Why in God's name would anyone want to
work for them?"
162,BLADE,162,"Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If
they're loyal, if they prove
themselves, then their masters will
turn them."
163,KAREN,163,And that's a good thing?
164,BLADE,164,"For some. Live forever, never get old.
The ultimate high."
165,BLADE,165,"How 'bout you, Officer? You a good
little bloodhound?"
166,BLADE,166,"Looks like our friend was
blood-running."
167,BLADE,167,Where were you headed?
168,GIDEON,168,Mphuck you --
169,GIDEON,169,"Jesus -- 1227 Brookner --
Holliston Clinic --"
170,KAREN,170,What are you doing?!
171,BLADE,171,Preventive medicine.
172,KAREN,172,"You can't do this, he's human, it's
murder."
173,BLADE,173,"It's war, now get the fuck out of the
way!"
174,BLADE,174,"God-damnit!!! Do you have any idea
what you just did?! He'll warn them.
They'll be waiting!"
175,KAREN,175,"You were going to kill him. What was I
supposed to do?! Shut my eyes and
pretend I didn't see what I saw?"
176,BLADE,176,"Let me set you straight on something,
Doctor. What you've ""seen"" so far is
nothing. The world you live in's just
the sugar-coated topping. There's
another world beneath it, the real
world -- and it's a fucking bloodbath.
If you want to survive in it, you'd
better pull your head out of your ass."
177,GIDEON,177,"Look, I know you're disappointed --"
178,FROST,178,Crestfallen.
179,GIDEON,179,"Blade was waiting for me. There wasn't
anything I could do."
180,FROST,180,"Tell me something, Gideon, what blood
type are you?"
181,GIDEON,181,I don't really know --
182,FROST,182,"Take a wild stab. A? B? O, perhaps?
I'm interested in the antigens here,
the agglutination reaction --"
183,FROST,183,I'm going to guess AB positive.
184,FROST,184,AB positive. Give the man a prize.
185,BLADE,185,"What the hell are you doing?! I could
have killed you!"
186,KAREN,186,"I remembered the address. I followed
you --"
187,BLADE,187,"Do you have a death wish or are you
just stupid?"
188,KAREN,188,"Look, if what you say is true, if
there's a chance I could turn into one
of them, then I've got no choice, do
I? I have to work with you. I need to
learn everything I can about them.
It's the only way I'll be able to find
a cure for myself."
189,BLADE,189,There is no cure.
190,KAREN,190,You don't know that.
191,KAREN,191,What are you looking at?
192,BLADE,192,What do you see here?
193,KAREN,193,Graffiti --
194,BLADE,194,Look closer.
195,BLADE,195,"This isn't a gang tag, it's a vampire
marking. It means there's a safe-house
nearby.
A place they can go if dawn is coming."
196,KAREN,196,"I know this place -- it's a blood
bank."
197,BLADE,197,"Owned by vampires. There's one of
these in every major city, and just
like Domino's, they always deliver."
198,BLADE,198,"You telling me you're ready to walk
through that door?"
199,BLADE,199,"All right, then, listen up, Vampire
Anatomy 101. Crosses and running water
don't do dick, so forget what you've
seen in the movies."
200,BLADE,200,"You use the stake, silver, or
sunlight, got it?"
201,BLADE,201,Know how to use one of these?
202,KAREN,202,No.
203,BLADE,203,"Safety's off, round's already
chambered --"
204,BLADE,204,"Silver hollow-points filled with
garlic. You aim for the heart or the
head, anything else is a one-way
ticket to a pine box."
205,BLADE,205,Get out. Now.
206,BLADE,206,"I know you're blood-running. Who's
your sponsor?"
207,TANAKA,207,I don't know what you're --
208,KAREN,208,What if you've made a mistake?
209,BLADE,209,What's this? A birthmark?
210,BLADE,210,Still think we might be wrong?
211,BLADE,211,How much are you shipping?
212,TANAKA,212,Bite me!
213,BLADE,213,"I've got a message for your masters --
the night's no longer safe for their
kind."
214,KAREN,214,You let him go --
215,KAREN,215,"An hour ago you were ready to kill a
man for less, this one didn't even
talk."
216,BLADE,216,He will.
217,AUTOMATED VOICE,217,"""You've reached a number that is no
longer in service. Please consult your
operator and try again""."
218,TANAKA'S VOICE,218,"It's Tanaka, PIN number
sixteen-zero-zero-nine --"
219,VOICE,219,Yes?
220,TANAKA,220,Get me Pearl!
221,VOICE,221,Pearl is feeding --
222,TANAKA,222,"Look, I'm not fucking around here!
That hunter Frost has been talking
about? He was just at the clinic. Tore
the goddamn place apart!"
223,BLADE,223,"Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place
is crawling with them."
224,BLADE,224,"See the valets over there? They're
vampires. So is the doorman."
225,KAREN,225,How can you tell?
226,BLADE,226,"The way they move, they way they
smell --"
227,BLADE,227,"The whore on the corner, she's one
too. So are the two men standing under
the streetlight."
228,KAREN,228,"So many of them -- I still can't
believe they're real."
229,BLADE,229,"There are worse things than vampires
out there."
230,KAREN,230,Like what?
231,BLADE,231,Like me.
232,DOORMAN,232,"I'm sorry, sir -- do you have an
invitation?"
233,KID,233,Hey --
234,BLADE,234,Where's the entrance?!
235,TANAKA,235,I can't -- they'll kill me!
236,BLADE,236,"I got news for you, butt-boy. You're
already dead."
237,TANAKA,237,"Oh God, shit -- behind the bookcase --"
238,BLADE,238,After you.
239,KAREN,239,What is this place?
240,BLADE,240,Some kind of archive --
241,KAREN,241,"Isn't this all a little high-tech? I
thought vampires were more into
cobwebs and coffins."
242,BLADE,242,"You've been watching too much TV.
They've got their claws sunk into
everything -- finance, real estate,
politics. Probably own half of
Downtown."
243,BLADE,243,"This must be where they keep their
records --"
244,PEARL'S VOICE,244,"Lorca, is that you?"
245,PEARL,245,He's here!
246,FROST'S VOICE,246,"Congratulations, Day-Walker."
247,BLADE,247,Frost?
248,FROST,248,"In the flesh, Blade. I understand
you've been looking for me. I'm
flattered."
249,BLADE,249,"Don't be. You're another notch on my
sword hilt, nothing else."
250,FROST,250,"You're quick, Blade, I'll give you
that. In the space of an hour you've
crossed my familiar, destroyed a blood
bank --"
251,FROST,251,"Now here you are in the heart of our
archives, terrorizing our curator."
252,PEARL'S VOICE,252,"He has a knife to my throat, Frost!
He --"
253,FROST,253,"You're history, Pearl. Have the good
grace to die with some dignity."
254,FROST,254,"Round one to you, Blade."
255,PEARL,255,What is that?
256,BLADE,256,"A sun lamp. We're gonna play twenty
questions. Depending on your answers,
you might get to have yourself a
tanning session."
257,BLADE,257,"What were you in such a big hurry to
delete just now?"
258,PEARL,258,"It's an epistle, a letter Frost has
been translating -- it prophesizes
LaMagra's return."
259,BLADE,259,And who is LaMagra?
260,PEARL,260,LaMagra is The Sleeper!!!
261,BLADE,261,"Where's the original, Pearl? You must
have it around here somewhere."
262,PEARL,262,The vault --
263,BLADE,263,"If he moves, cook him."
264,PEARL,264,"Please, I'll give you the combination
-- you'll damage the documents --"
265,BLADE,265,That's the point.
266,KAREN,266,He moved.
267,KAREN,267,What are these?
268,QUINN (o.s.),268,Curiosity killed the cat.
269,QUINN,269,"Hola, amigo. Remember me?"
270,QUINN,270,"You took my arm, Blade. But that's
okay, I'm growing a new one --"
271,QUINN,271,"Nice, huh? Think I'll ever play the
piano again?"
272,QUINN,272,"You can slice him, you can dice him,
and the man just keeps on coming."
273,QUINN,273,"Stay with me, sweetness, I'm not
through with you yet."
274,QUINN,274,Teak. Nice craftsmanship.
275,QUINN,275,"Now here's a man who takes his job
just a little too seriously, don't you
think?"
276,QUINN,276,"Which reminds me, Blade, think I owe
you one --"
277,QUINN,277,"Actually, if you want to get
technical, I owe you two."
278,QUINN,278,"What's so funny, bright eyes?"
279,BLADE,279,I'm expecting some company.
280,VOICE,280,Get down!
281,WHISTLER,281,"Christ, I'm too old for this. Somebody
get me a goddamn wheelchair."
282,KAREN,282,How did you find us?!
283,WHISTLER,283,We keep in radio contact.
284,KAREN,284,"You've been listening in the whole
time?"
285,WHISTLER,285,"You think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperone? Blade ferrets
their rat-holes out, I map them. Then
we blow them all to kingdom come."
286,WHISTLER,286,"There's a subway line due East of
here. We'd best make tracks."
287,KAREN,287,Whistler!
288,WHISTLER,288,"Go on, I'll be fine!"
289,BLADE,289,He can take care of himself! GO!!!
290,KAREN,290,You're hurt --
291,BLADE,291,Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
292,BLADE,292,I need help with this --
293,KAREN,293,What am I injecting you with?
294,BLADE,294,"Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin
substitute."
295,KAREN,295,"You're one of them, aren't you?"
296,BLADE,296,"Not quite. I'm a hybrid. Half-human,
half-vampire."
297,WHISTLER,297,What took you so long?
298,BLADE,298,"Don't even start, old man."
299,KAREN,299,"Why didn't you tell me the truth
about him?"
300,WHISTLER,300,We weren't sure we could trust you.
301,WHISTLER,301,"Blade's mother was attacked by a
vampire while she was pregnant.
Ultimately, she died, but her unborn
child lived. Unfortunately, he'd
undergone certain genetic changes
while in the womb --"
302,WHISTLER,302,"I found Blade when he was thirteen.
He'd been living on the streets,
feeding off the homeless. Apparently
the Thirst manifested itself at
puberty --"
303,WHISTLER,303,"I took him for one of them at first,
almost killed him, too. But then I
realized what he was."
304,QUINN,304,He took my fucking hand! Again!
305,FROST,305,"You seem to be in the habit of losing
them fairly often, Quinn. Maybe the
amputee lifestyle just suits you."
306,QUINN,306,"We need to find him, tonight."
307,FROST,307,"Down, boy. Blade's not going anywhere.
I promise. Right now, though, we've
more pressing business --"
308,FROST,308,It's time Dragonetti paid the piper.
309,WHISTLER,309,"Blade's unique, you know. A one in a
billion anomaly. He can withstand
sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he
still has the Thirst."
310,KAREN,310,"What happens if he doesn't take the
serum?"
311,WHISTLER,311,"The Thirst overcomes him, just like
the others. It's not something he can
control."
312,WHISTLER,312,"The problem is, time's running out.
His body's starting to reject the
serum. And so far, all my efforts to
find a cure have ended in failure --"
313,KAREN,313,"No offense, Whistler, but you're not
exactly working with state of the art
equipment here. You might have missed
something."
314,WHISTLER,314,"Which is why you're here. We could use
someone with your experience."
315,WHISTLER,315,"This used to be mine, you know. It's
been passed down through the
centuries, from one hunter to the
next --"
316,KAREN,316,Why do you hunt them?
317,WHISTLER,317,"Habit, mostly, just like this."
318,WHISTLER,318,"I had a family once -- a wife, three
daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon
Frost came calling one evening --"
319,KAREN,319,He killed them?
320,WHISTLER,320,"Eventually. He toyed with them first.
He made me choose, do you understand?
Which order they would die in --"
321,KAREN,321,How did you escape?
322,WHISTLER,322,"I didn't. He was cruel enough to let
me live."
323,WHISTLER,323,"Even gave me a souvenir to remember
him by."
324,KAREN,324,"And now you're using Blade to exact
your revenge?"
325,WHISTLER,325,"Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and
I'm not getting any younger, am I?"
326,WHISTLER,326,"I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
It's best to leave him alone when he's
like this."
327,KAREN,327,I'll take my chances.
328,KAREN,328,Blade?
329,KAREN,329,It's dark in here.
330,BLADE,330,You get used to the darkness.
331,KAREN,331,Whistler told me about your mother.
332,BLADE,332,"I can't close my eyes without hearing
her scream."
333,KAREN,333,"Those aren't real memories. No one has
that kind of recall."
334,BLADE,334,"I do. I remember from day one. People
staring at me, sensing I was
different. Watching the fear grow in
their eyes, knowing in their hearts I
wasn't human."
335,KAREN,335,"If you're not human, then why do you
bleed like us?
I've seen vampire blood, you don't
have it running through your veins."
336,BLADE,336,Just get out of here.
337,KAREN,337,Blade --
338,BLADE,338,"I said, GET OUT!!!"
339,FROST'S VOICE,339,"Rise and shine, little wing."
340,DRAGONETTI,340,What is this? Where am I?!
341,FROST,341,"When was the last time you stopped to
appreciate a sunrise, Dragonetti?
Three, four hundred years?"
342,FROST,342,How do you like that? Right on time.
343,DRAGONETTI,343,"The other elders will never let you
get away with this!"
344,DRAGONETTI,344,"Don't you see, you fools?! He'll
betray you too! He's planning on
invoking LaMagra himself!"
345,FROST,345,"The wheel turns, old fang. Guess you
just got a little too long in the
tooth."
346,FROST,346,"Dragonetti was right. You were fools
to trust me."
347,WHISTLER,347,Going somewhere?
348,BLADE,348,China Town. I need more serum.
349,BLADE,349,What's all this?
350,KAREN,350,"I made a trip to the hospital last
night, borrowed some equipment."
351,BLADE,351,For your miracle cure?
352,WHISTLER,352,"She's been making real progress,
Blade."
353,WHISTLER,353,Show him --
354,KAREN,354,"This is sodium citrate. It's an
anti-coagulant. We use it to treat
blood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood
is thinner than humans, though. Watch
what happens when I introduce some
into a sample --"
355,WHISTLER,355,"Can you imagine what a dash of that
would do on your sword?"
356,KAREN,356,"Before you go, I'd like to take a
sample of your blood."
357,KAREN,357,Is he sick?
358,BLADE,358,Cancer.
359,KAREN,359,"You care about him, don't you?"
360,BLADE,360,"We've got a good arrangement, that's
all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use
them, the vampires die -- end of
story."
361,KAREN,361,"My mother used to say that a cold
heart is a dead heart."
362,BLADE,362,"Your mother sounds like a Hallmark
greeting card."
363,BLADE,363,"I'd wish you luck, Doc, but I never
put much stock in optimism."
364,BLADE,364,"How's it going, Kam?"
365,KAM,365,You're a week early.
366,BLADE,366,I was in the neighborhood.
367,BLADE,367,"Whistler says I'm building up a
resistance to it."
368,KAM,368,I was afraid that might happen.
369,BLADE,369,"Maybe it's time to start exploring
other alternatives."
370,KAM,370,"There's only one alternative to the
serum."
371,BLADE,371,Yeah. I know.
372,BLADE,372,"Thanks, Kam."
373,BLADE,373,"One other thing. Have you ever heard
of a vampire called the Sleeper?"
374,BLADE,374,"I found this in there archives. I need
to find someone who can read their
language."
375,KAM,375,"I've heard about a woman named
Miracia. Some say she's a mayombero, a
Santeria witch. Supposedly she lives
in that tent community down by the
city dump. I'm told she only sees
people at night."
376,VOICE (o.s.),376,Blade.
377,VOICE (o.s.),377,Blade.
378,MAN,378,"Afternoon, Blade."
379,FROST,379,Easy.
380,FROST,380,"Wouldn't want our little friend here
to wind up on the back of a milk
carton, would we?"
381,FROST,381,"Beautiful day, isn't it?"
382,BLADE,382,How can you be out here?
383,FROST,383,"I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical
research. We've developed a type of
sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a
few others things."
384,FROST,384,"It's not very effective in direct
sunlight, but it's a start. The goal,
of course, is to be like you, ""the
Day-walker""."
385,BLADE,385,I don't buy it.
386,FROST,386,"Why not? The future of our race runs
through your bloodstream. You've got
the best of both worlds, Blade. All of
our strengths and none of our
weaknesses."
387,BLADE,387,Maybe I don't see it that way.
388,FROST,388,"Oh, so it's back to pretending we're
human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle
Tom routine. You can't keep denying
what you are. You're one of us, Blade.
You always have been."
389,BLADE,389,You're wrong.
390,FROST,390,"Am I? You think the humans will ever
accept a half-breed like you? They
can't. They're afraid of you."
391,FROST,391,"The humans fear us because we're
superior. They fear us because in
their hearts they know their race has
become obsolete."
392,FROST,392,"Look at them, just an endless stream
of cattle in a mad race to the
slaughterhouse."
393,FROST,393,The pause that refreshes --
394,FROST,394,"Care for some? Smells good, doesn't
it? Pungent, with just an
irrepressible hint of iron."
395,BLADE,395,Pass.
396,FROST,396,"You sure now? I bled a newborn for
this. You won't find a drink that's
sweeter."
397,FROST,397,"Tell me honestly, do you really get
the same rush from that pasteurized
piss-serum of yours?"
398,FROST,398,"You're surprised I know about your
serum? You shouldn't be. I know
everything about you."
399,FROST,399,"You can't keep walking the razor's
edge, Blade. The day will come -- and
soon, when you'll have to choose
between our kind and their's. If I
were you, I'd take care not to wind up
on the wrong end of the fang."
400,FROST,400,"Love to continue this chat, but it
appears I'm melting."
401,BLADE,401,You're not going anywhere.
402,FROST,402,Watch me.
403,MERCURY,403,"This is Mercury. Tell Deacon I've
found their hiding place."
404,BLADE,404,Any progress?
405,KAREN,405,Some. It's been slow --
406,BLADE,406,You don't look so good.
407,KAREN,407,"I'm just tired, that's all. We've been
up all night."
408,KAREN,408,Excuse me.
409,BLADE (O.S.),409,It's started.
410,BLADE,410,You've got another day or two at most.
411,BLADE,411,"For what it's worth, I'm sorry."
412,KAREN,412,"You make it sound like I'm already
dead."
413,MAN,413,Extranjero. Â¿Quien es?
414,BLADE,414,I'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me.
415,WOMAN,415,This way.
416,KAREN,416,"All right, let's start with the basics
-- why do vampires need to drink
blood?"
417,WHISTLER,417,"Their own blood can't sustain
hemoglobin."
418,KAREN,418,"Then vampirism is a genetic defect,
just like Hemolytic anemia?"
419,KAREN,419,So what about gene therapy?
420,KAREN,420,"Basically you'd have to re-write the
victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA
will produce proteins capable of
generating hemoglobin."
421,WHISTLER,421,How?
422,KAREN,422,"With a retrovirus. It's injected into
the bone marrow cells, it causes the
host's DNA to mutate. They've been
using them to treat Sickle-cell
anemia."
423,WHISTLER,423,"You're serious? You actually think
this could work?"
424,KAREN,424,"On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so
sure --"
425,KAREN,425,"The problem is, Blade didn't contract
the vampire virus from a bite like I
did. He was born with it. The irony
is, I could probably cure every
vampire but him."
426,WHISTLER,426,"Then we're back to square one, aren't
we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always
wins."
427,KAREN,427,What happened to the power?
428,WHISTLER,428,"I don't know, but the back-up
generator should've kicked in."
429,WHISTLER,429,UV floodlights are down too.
430,WHISTLER,430,Get it!!!
431,WHISTLER,431,"Understand this -- they are monsters.
Hesitate for even a moment, and you've
lost."
432,FROST (O.S.),432,"Words to live by, Whistler."
433,FROST,433,"It's been a long time, hasn't it, ""old
friend""?"
434,MIRACIA,434,"Is something wrong, my friend?"
435,BLADE,435,You're blind --
436,MIRACIA,436,There are other ways to see. Sit.
437,MIRACIA,437,"Perhaps you have brought me something
-- an offering for the orishas?"
438,MIRACIA,438,Hold out your hands.
439,BLADE,439,"I didn't come here to get my palms
read. I need something translated."
440,MIRACIA,440,Show me.
441,MIRACIA,441,Sangre. Written in blood.
442,MIRACIA,442,"This is an old tongue, from an old
world. It concerns LaMagra."
443,BLADE,443,Who is LaMagra?
444,MIRACIA,444,"The vampire God. This speaks of His
return."
445,MIRACIA,445,"""-- there will come a Day Walker."""
446,MIRACIA,446,"""His blood will call the Sleeper from
beyond the Veil of Tears."""
447,BLADE,447,His blood -- ?
448,MIRACIA,448,"The Day Walker's blood is a disparador
-- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's
return. One need only consume it and
the spirit of his ancestors will
settle upon him."
449,MIRACIA,449,"""And the Sleeper will rise from the
shadows anew, cleansing the world in a
Tide of Blood."""
450,BLADE,450,"""The Blood Tide""."
451,MIRACIA,451,"Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is
said that all who feel its taint will
succumb to the Thirst."
452,BLADE,452,How do I stop it?
453,MIRACIA,453,"The Great Wheel turns, my friend. The
Dark is rising. How would you fight a
shadow?"
454,MIRACIA,454,I am tired. Dawn is coming.
455,BLADE,455,But I just got here --
456,MIRACIA,456,"You've been here longer than you
think."
457,BLADE,457,WHISTLER?!
458,BLADE,458,"Jesus, Whistler, what did they do to
you?"
459,WHISTLER,459,Frost took her --
460,BLADE,460,Don't try to talk --
461,WHISTLER,461,"Listen. You have to -- finish me off.
You don't want me coming back."
462,BLADE,462,"No, we can treat the wounds --"
463,WHISTLER,463,"Too far gone, you know that."
464,BLADE,464,"Whistler, I can't."
465,WHISTLER,465,Yes you can. Now get on with it.
466,BLADE,466,"Whistler, I --"
467,WHISTLER,467,I know.
468,WHISTLER,468,"Just be quick about it, will you? Do
it right."
469,FROST,469,"Hello, Blade. By the time you watch
this, Whistler will no doubt be
winging his way to Heaven, thanks to
your capable hands. If it makes any
difference to you, he put up quite a
fight."
470,FROST,470,"Now, I'm sure you're wondering about
Ms. Jansen's well-being. She's alive
and kicking -- ""ambulatory"", as they
like to say in the trade. Whether or
not she remains so is entirely up to
you."
471,FROST,471,"I'll make this as easy as possible for
you, Blade. You can find us at the
Edgewood Towers. We'll be waiting with
baited breath."
472,FROST,472,"Well, here we are, Doctor."
473,KAREN,473,Why haven't you killed me yet?
474,MERCURY,474,"Deacon likes to play with his food
before he eats it."
475,KAREN,475,How many of you are there?
476,FROST,476,"A few thousand scattered about the
globe. In the past, we've had to
restrict our numbers for fear of
discovery. That won't be necessary
after tonight."
477,KAREN,477,What happens then?
478,FROST,478,"The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied
holy war against the humans. There's a
force, you see -- a spirit that exists
in our blood. I've discovered a way to
invoke it."
479,KAREN,479,LaMagra --
480,FROST,480,"That's right. The answers were there
all along, of course, scribbled down
in the forgotten languages of my kind.
Waiting for someone with the patience
to decipher them.
My elders were foolish enough to
dismiss them as wives tales. But I
knew better."
481,FROST,481,"Imagine my surprise when Blade turned
out to be the key which would set that
force free."
482,FROST,482,"LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a
spirit, requiring a flesh and blood
host in order to manifest himself."
483,KAREN,483,You.
484,FROST,484,Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
485,KAREN,485,"There's no need for any of this. Your
condition can be treated. Whistler and
I were working on a cure when --"
486,FROST,486,"What makes you think we want to be
cured? Blood is only part of the
equation. The hunt, the killing,
that's what the Thirst is really
about."
487,KAREN,487,But you use blood banks --
488,FROST,488,"Only as a last resort. Preserved blood
is inferior. There's no flavor left to
it, no life."
489,FROST,489,"Fortunately, I've found a way around
that particular obstacle."
490,FROST,490,"Under these conditions I can keep a
donor alive for years, producing
anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints
of blood."
491,FROST,491,"Of course, this is just a pilot
program, really. Once the Tide comes,
we'll need to expand production. So
many more mouths to feed --"
492,KAREN,492,You're a monster.
493,FROST,493,"Why? Because we live at another
species' expense? Your people farm
cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening
them up with steroids? It's called
evolution, Doctor. Survival of the
fittest."
494,FROST,494,"I have a wake-up call for the human
race. You're no longer at the top of
the food chain."
495,VAMPIRE,495,"You think I'm afraid of that toothpick
of yours?"
496,BLADE,496,"You should be. I've made some
improvements."
497,VANESSA,497,Jason.
498,BLADE,498,Mother -- ?!
499,VANESSA,499,"I've missed you so much, Jason."
500,VANESSA,500,"You have no idea what I've been
through, how much I've wanted to see
you --"
501,BLADE,501,But you -- died --
502,VANESSA,502,Deacon brought me back.
503,BLADE,503,Fight him --
504,FROST,504,"She can't. She's one of my thralls
now. She has about as much free will
as a puppet on a string."
505,FROST,505,"You love me, don't you, Vanessa?"
506,VANESSA,506,Yes.
507,FROST,507,"What do we have here? Your precious
serum? I don't think you'll be needing
this anymore."
508,BLADE,508,Please --
509,VANESSA,509,"Listen to your father, Jason. It's
going to be a better world."
510,FROST,510,"Don't look so surprised, Blade. You've
spent your life looking for the
vampire who fathered you. Well you can
rest easy now, you've found him."
511,FROST,511,Daddy's here.
512,FROST,512,"It's true, Blade. You've got my blood
running through your veins."
513,FROST,513,"Thirty years ago. A moonlit street, a
woman on her way home alone. You were
conceived the night I tore my fangs
into your mother's flesh."
514,KAREN,514,Are you all right?
515,BLADE,515,I've been better --
516,BLADE,516,How long have we been driving?
517,KAREN,517,"I don't know. I woke up just before
you did --"
518,KAREN,518,Is it bad?
519,BLADE,519,"We get out of this alive, maybe I'll
take that miracle cure of yours."
520,KAREN,520,It won't work on you.
521,BLADE,521,What are you talking about?
522,KAREN,522,"Your condition's congenital, the
genetic mutations occurred in utero.
All the other victims contracted
vampirism after birth."
523,KAREN,523,"I can't cure you, Blade. I can cure
myself, but I can't cure you."
524,KAREN,524,I'm so sorry.
525,FROST,525,"Welcome home, children."
526,FROST,526,"On its surface, this building houses
one of the city's oldest financial
institutions -- and for over
two-hundred years its served our
corporate needs. Look beneath the
surface, however, and you'll discover
another truth entirely --"
527,FROST,527,"As above, so below."
528,FROST,528,"Welcome to our hall of ancients,
Doctor. We call it the Temple of
Night."
529,FROST,529,Let's see this sword of his.
530,FROST,530,"Still quite sharp, I see."
531,KAREN,531,Blade --
532,FROST,532,"You're wasting your breath, woman. He
can't hear you now. It's the Thirst,
you see? It already has him in its
grip."
533,FROST,533,"How long has it been since you had
your serum? Twelve hours? More? You
must be quite thirsty by now."
534,FROST,534,"What does it feel like? Is your blood
on fire? Are you burning up inside?
Give in to the Thirst, Blade. Embrace
your true nature."
535,BLADE,535,-- go to hell --
536,FROST,536,"I've got news for you, Blade. We're
already here."
537,FROST,537,"Take him to the sanctuary. It's time
he was bled."
538,FROST,538,"I'd let you watch the proceedings,
Doctor, but I'm afraid that privilege
is reserved for members of my own
race. Don't worry, though, I've made
alternate arrangements for you."
539,FROST,539,"We call this the Bone Pit. It's where
we keep our mistakes, the ones who
couldn't successfully make the
transition from human to vampire."
540,FROST,540,"They'll feed on anything, given the
chance -- animals, corpses, even other
vampires."
541,FROST,541,"Of course, a strapping young woman
like yourself -- well I think you just
might be considered finger food."
542,FROST,542,"It's been a long road, hasn't it? Such
a pity Whistler led you so far astray."
543,FROST,543,"I don't blame you, though. I want you
to know that. Even after all you've
done. I understand, Blade, I really
do. It's the human side of you which
has corrupted your reasoning, made you
weak. But we'll take care of that,
won't we?"
544,BLADE,544,"I'd kill myself -- before I turned
into something like you."
545,FROST,545,"No you wouldn't. I'm going to bleed
you dry, Blade. All the poison that
makes you human."
546,FROST,546,"When the Tide comes, you'll be begging
me put you through the Change."
547,FROST,547,"It's done. We should ready ourselves
for the ritual of invocation."
548,VANESSA (O.S.),548,"There's no use fighting us, Jason."
549,BLADE,549,How could you be a part of this?
550,VANESSA,550,"These are my people now. I'm one of
them."
551,BLADE,551,You don't have to be.
552,VANESSA,552,"You don't understand. I've killed,
I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it."
553,VANESSA,553,"I wish you could see the world as I
do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no
turning back from that."
554,BLADE,554,I don't believe that.
555,VANESSA,555,"You will. Time is on our side. Sooner
or later, the Thirst always wins."
556,BLADE,556,Mother!
557,VANESSA,557,"Your mother died the night you
were born."
558,REVENANT (O.S.),558,Karennnnn --
559,REVENANT,559,"Karreennnnnn. I never thought I'd see
you againnnnn."
560,KAREN,560,Curtis?!
561,CURTIS REVENANT,561,"Tell, me, Karennn -- ever have second
thoughts -- about us?"
562,MERCURY,562,"It won't be long now, lover."
563,QUINN,563,We should finish him off.
564,MERCURY,564,No. Deacon wants him turned.
565,QUINN,565,"Fucking waste, if you ask me."
566,FROST,566,"Tonight is the night we've waited our
entire lives for. Tonight, the
blood-dimmed Tide is loosed upon the
world. Tonight, the Age of Man comes
to an end."
567,KAREN,567,Blade.
568,FROST,568,"""And what rough beast, its hour come
round at last, slouches towards
Bethlehem to be born?"""
569,BLADE,569,Get out of here --
570,KAREN,570,I'm not leaving without you.
571,BLADE,571,You don't understand. The Thirst --
572,BLADE,572,-- tearing me -- apart.
573,KAREN,573,I know. Take some of my blood.
574,BLADE,574,No --
575,KAREN,575,"It's the only way. You know that.
We'll never get out of here alive if
you don't."
576,BLADE,576,I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
577,KAREN,577,"Yes you will. The human side of you is
stronger. I know it is."
578,BLADE,578,NO!!!!
579,KAREN,579,Don't stop --
580,KAREN,580,My God --
581,KAREN,581,Are you -- all right?
582,BLADE,582,Never been better.
583,MERCURY,583,Deacon?
584,FROST,584,No longer.
585,BLADE (O.S.),585,Frost!!!
586,BLADE,586,Who dies first?
587,FROST,587,Take him.
588,QUINN,588,Grew another hand for you sweetmeat --
589,QUINN,589,-- and now I'm gonna kill you with it.
590,BLADE,590,"Let's see if you can grow a new one
of these!"
591,BLADE,591,Next?
592,MERCURY,592,Have a taste of your own medicine!
593,FROST (O.S.),593,Enough!!!
594,FROST,594,"You're too late, Blade. I'm already
changing. Don't you see? The Sleeper
has awakened. I'm not just Frost
anymore. I'm becoming a god now,
blood incarnate."
595,VANESSA,595,"Did you think I'd forgotten you, you
little whore?"
596,FROST,596,You can't hurt me anymore.
597,BLADE,597,Where are you?!
598,FROST,598,Everywhere.
599,FROST,599,You want my blood so much?! Take it!
600,FROST,600,"I was wrong about you, Blade. You were
never one of us. You're a traitor to
your race."
601,KAREN (O.S.),601,Get away from him!
602,KAREN,602,Blade!
603,BLADE,603,"Guess you're not quite as invulnerable
as you thought."
604,FROST,604,"You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and
my transition will be complete. Even
your sword won't be able to affect me
then."
605,BLADE,605,"You don't have a few minutes, Frost."
606,FROST,606,"Just as I thought. Still chained to
your mother's breast after all these
years."
607,FROST,607,"You're too human, Blade."
608,BLADE,608,"It's because I'm human that I can do
this."
609,KAREN (O.S.),609,Blade?
610,KAREN,610,"I never imagined I'd be so happy to
see the sun rise --"
611,KAREN,611,"It's over, isn't it?"
612,BLADE,612,For them. But for me --
613,BLADE,613,I feel like it's finally beginning.
