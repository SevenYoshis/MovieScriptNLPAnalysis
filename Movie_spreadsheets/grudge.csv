0,MARIA,0,Hey.     Are you okay?
1,MARIA,1,Peter?    What's the matter?
2,MARIA,2,"Standing in the middle of the rush-hour pedestrian traffic is
KAREN (20s, American). She faces upstream, looking for
someone. The flow threatens to carry her away in a
heartbeat. She looks fragile, intimidated by the madness."
3,DOUG (O.S.),3,"Karen!
She turns to see her boyfriend DOUG (20s, American)
approaching. With a reassuring smile he takes her hand --
-- and together, they force their way through the throng,
trying to escape the flow. They're jostled and crushed by
the crowd, and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer."
4,KAREN,4,I'll never get used to this.
5,DOUG,5,"Maybe we should find a different
train station.
He abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still
holding Karen's hand. She turns, wondering what's going on.
She sees the smile on his lips a moment before --
-- he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her. As if the
crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all.
It's tender and loving, and she responds... at first.   But
then she pulls away, shy."
6,KAREN,6,"A public display of affection is
considered rude in Japan.
There's an opening ahead into a SIDE STREET.   Doug and Karen
deftly slip out of the traffic --"
7,KAREN,7,OMITTED
8,KAREN,8,"-- and walk hand-in-hand down the much quieter street, away
from the crowded thoroughfare.
Doug smiles as they pass by two JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL COUPLES,
making out on the street corner. He turns to give Karen a
sarcastic look --"
9,KAREN,9,What's that?
10,DOUG,10,"We walk past this temple every day,
Karen --"
11,KAREN,11,"Yeah, but I've never seen this
before."
12,KAREN,12,"It's a Buddhist ritual. The
incense smoke carries the prayers
to the spirits of his ancestors, to
help them remain at peace."
13,DOUG,13,"It's amazing. You're like this
infinite storehouse of wisdom. Or
trivia. I'm not sure which."
14,KAREN,14,"It's not trivia. It's what they
believe. And it's far better, by
the way, than your little pollution
ritual."
15,KAREN,15,What?
16,"Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      2B.
DOUG",16,"Nothing. I just -- I like that
about you. You seem to be able to
remember everything that's really
important."
17,DOUG,17,Except the time.
18,KAREN,18,"Oh, crap --"
19,KAREN,19,"C'mon, you're gonna be late."
20,KAREN,20,"An international college in Tokyo. The autumn chill doesn't
deter the students from enjoying the beautiful day.
Karen and Doug, still holding hands, enter the campus."
21,KAREN,21,"Karen and Doug approach the doors of a NURSING CARE CENTER.
She pulls him to the side just as he's stepping under a
WORKMAN'S LADDER by the doors."
22,KAREN,22,Uh-uh. Seven years of bad luck.
23,KAREN,23,"And I might have a vested interest
in those years."
24,DOUG,24,Is that right?
25,KAREN,25,"Maybe.
Doug smiles, kissing her romantically.   Then:"
26,DOUG,26,Will I see you tonight?
27,KAREN,27,"I'll call you when I get home.
With a flourish, Doug SWINGS HIMSELF back under the ladder."
28,DOUG,28,Fourteen.    I hate odd numbers.
29,DOUG,29,"Through the front doors, we see Doug kiss Karen again.   They
finally separate, and Doug walks off."
30,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     5.,30,Karen!
31,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     5.,31,Are you free this afternoon?
32,KAREN,32,"I just came by to pick up some
books I left here. I'm not
scheduled to work today --"
33,KAREN,33,"I know. But are you free?    Do you
have class?"
34,KAREN,34,"(shaking her head:)
Just a test to study for.   Why?"
35,KAREN,35,Your wish has been granted.
36,KAREN,36,"It's Yoko's case, but she didn't
show up for work this morning, and
I can't reach her at home. She
must be sick, or something. And
she has the damn house key."
37,KAREN,37,What's this phrase?
38,KAREN,38,"""Mild dementia with severe
lethargy."" Apparently she sleeps
through most of the day. Her
daughter-in-law doesn't work, so
she'll probably be there."
39,KAREN,39,"You're the one who's been bugging
me about getting out there on your
own. Besides, it's an English-only
house."
40,KAREN,40,"Here's the address. Use the wall
chart if you need help -- and don't
forget to bring a map."
41,KAREN,41,"Karen looks at THE ADDRESS -- a string of thirty numbers and
Japanese characters. She glances up at
THE WALL CHART: a color-coded diagram shows how the long
address string is broken down into Postal Code, Prefecture,
City, Ward, District, Block, Sub-Block and House Number."
42,KAREN,42,"Don't worry Karen, you're ready.
Karen nods.   But she's not quite as confident."
43,KAREN,43,"People rush madly around Karen as she studies A LARGE MAP on
the wall. It's the Tokyo rail system -- daunting, at best."
44,KAREN,44,OMITTED
45,KAREN,45,"Karen sits uncomfortably on the crowded transit car, squeezed
in tightly by the people around her. The LOUD CRYING of a
baby adds to her discomfort."
46,KAREN,46,"The transit car pulls to a stop and a handful of people get
out. Karen is one of them, shouldering her backpack."
47,KAREN,47,"Karen walks down the populated sidewalk, weaving through
STREET VENDORS, and passing a large GROCERY STORE.
She pauses, looking at the address on her card. She
approaches a WOMAN and her DAUGHTER (6) and speaks to them in
Japanese. The woman nods, pointing towards a small ALLEY.
Karen gives the daughter a smile;   the girl hides behind her
mother's leg."
48,KAREN,48,"Karen exits the alley, entering a quiet, narrow street.
She's still not sure if she's in the right place.
But then her eyes fix on something. She begins to walk
towards it, her gaze never leaving it --"
49,KAREN,49,"-- it's THE HOUSE.   Cozy and shaded, nestled into the dead
end of the street.   Large by Tokyo standards.
She double-checks the address and opens the gate, walking
around a BICYCLE leaning against the wall and following the
stepping-stone path to the front door. She knocks. No
answer. She tries again. Nothing.
Then, an afterthought, she tries the handle.   It's unlocked."
50,KAREN,50,Karen pokes her head inside the genkan (entry hall).
51,KAREN,51,"Hello?   Mrs. Williams?
Nothing. She tentatively steps inside, and the door closes
behind her. It's dark and musty -- the blinds are drawn."
52,KAREN,52,"Is anyone here?
She turns and LOCKS THE FRONT DOOR."
53,KAREN,53,"Karen stands in the doorway, surveying the room.   The place
is in a complete state of disarray.
A SCRAPING sound grabs Karen's attention.
HER POV: at the far end of the room, a FROSTED-GLASS PANELED
DOOR leads to an adjacent room.
A HAND is visible on the other side, clawing at the glass.
Karen runs over and slides open the door, revealing --"
54,KAREN,54,"EMMA (60s, American). The older woman in the picture from
Karen's file. She's lying on her stomach on a stained
mattress, feebly looking up at Karen."
55,KAREN,55,"Oh my God... are you alright? --
Karen immediately kneels down next to the infirm woman,
helping her sit up. Emma looks dazed and disoriented.
Karen's eyes sweep the room.   It reeks of neglect."
56,KAREN,56,"Emma sits on the back porch, staring vacantly. But her
expression isn't simply blank - there's an odd sadness there."
57,KAREN,57,"Okay, Emma. Let's try again: my
name is Karen. Do you remember?
I'm from the Health Center. I'm
substituting for Yoko, just for
today.
Emma doesn't respond -- and there's no indication that she
remembers Karen introducing herself before.
Kneeling in front of Emma, Karen notices a BAND-AID around
one of her fingers. Blood has soaked through it."
58,KAREN,58,"Looks like you need a new Band-Aid.
How'd this happen, Emma?"
59,KAREN,59,"Would you like a bath? Maybe that
will help you feel better.
Emma doesn't even turn towards her."
60,KAREN,60,"Karen turns on the water, puts the stopper over the drain."
61,KAREN,61,"Karen supports Emma's weight as she leads the old woman
slowly down the hallway to the bathroom entrance --
-- Emma stops at the doorway.    Eyes fixed on THE TUB."
62,KAREN,62,"It's okay, Emma.
She takes Emma's hand and walks inside. But Emma doesn't
budge. Her free hand TIGHTLY CLUTCHES the door frame.
Her eyes are wide.   Staring at the bathtub."
63,KAREN,63,"Karen uses a sponge to bathe Emma, her robe rolled to her
waist. Emma stares absently at the sky."
64,KAREN,64,"With Emma back in bed, Karen steps out of the back room and
slides the door shut. Leans against it for a moment. A
tough first day on the job."
65,KAREN,65,"Karen has straightened up the room, and is vacuuming the
floor. Something under the couch catches in the vacuum
intake, jamming it.
She turns off the vacuum and feels underneath, pulling out A
CRUMPLED PHOTO -- ripped into pieces, compressed in a ball."
66,KAREN,66,"Karen sits at the kitchen table, flattening and taping
together the pieces of the photograph. She finishes.
ON THE PHOTO: a grinning JAPANESE BOY holds a cute BLACK
CAT. His MOTHER and FATHER stand beside him. They're all
beaming at the camera -- a perfect, happy family.
But there's a piece missing.   The MOTHER'S FACE.
Karen walks back into the Living Room. She looks underneath
the couch for the missing piece. Can't see anything.
She lays down and sticks her arm under the couch, feeling
around. Nothing.
Karen sticks her arm in deeper, to the shoulder, straining...
She suddenly jerks her arm back, wincing.   She has a small
cut on her finger.
Karen looks under the couch for what cut her --
-- a small FURNITURE NAIL sticks out underneath."
67,KAREN,67,"Nice one, Karen.
She gets to her feet, folding up the incomplete picture and
stuffing it into her pocket."
68,KAREN,68,"Karen steps into the foyer with the vacuum cleaner. She
looks up at A RAILING overhead. Some trash is visible
sticking over the edge. Karen shakes her head:"
69,KAREN,69,How did you get up there?
70,KAREN,70,"She gathers up the vacuum and heads up to the SECOND FLOOR
HALLWAY. There's a nearby door, closed (the FRONT ROOM), and
an open door at the end (the REAR ROOM).
As she looks for an outlet, she hears a SCRATCHING SOUND.
Karen stands there for a moment, listening.    Silence.
Then she walks towards the open door at the end of the hall."
71,KAREN,71,"Karen steps inside. MOVING BOXES are stacked against the
wall, next to a desk. It's an unfinished room.
She listens.   No scratching.   Nothing unusual here.   Except --
Karen notices a lone object sitting on an otherwise empty
shelf. It's a BLACK CERAMIC CAT. Facing the wall. Strange.
And then Karen hears the SCRATCHING SOUND again."
72,KAREN,72,"Karen steps into the hallway and listens.   There it is again,
and this time there's no doubt --
The sounds are coming from the room by the stairs.
Karen walks to the door. She pauses, disturbed by the eerie
sounds from inside. Then she reaches for the doorknob.
THUD. THUD. Karen hesitates. The strange rhythmic THUDDING
continues, coming from beyond the door."
73,KAREN,73,"Hello?
Karen takes a breath.   And turns the doorknob."
74,KAREN,74,"The sounds immediately stop as Karen enters the MASTER
BEDROOM. It's dark, thick blinds covering the windows. A
frosted window, overlooking the foyer, isn't helping much.
She stands there for a moment, listening.   Silence.
Then --"
75,KAREN,75,"SCRATCH SCRATCH. Startled, she gasps and turns towards THE
CLOSED CLOSET DOORS. That's where the sound is coming from.
And then she notices something strange about the closet door:
It's been sealed shut with duct tape.
The SCRATCHING quickens, as if sensing a presence nearby.
And then there's a muffled MEOW.   There's a cat in there?
Karen pulls off the duct tape. She reaches for the door
handle, slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside --
The closet seems empty, except for a large BOOK on a shelf.
Karen reaches inside and picks it up.
Then she sees, in the darkened far corner of the closet, a
SMALL BLACK CAT. It's sitting on something, watching her.
Karen slides the door the rest of the way open --
-- revealing A YOUNG JAPANESE BOY (age 7) sitting in the
corner, staring at Karen. The cat is curled up on his lap.
Startled, Karen drops the book and falls backwards."
76,KAREN,76,Karen is on her cell phone:
77,KAREN (INTO PHONE),77,"Yes, he was shut in a closet!
There was tape around the -- No,
they're not home yet. I don't
know, Emma hasn't said a word to me
-- He's still upstairs -- yes, I'm
sure he's Japanese -- But -- Yes,
alright, Alex. Just please get
here as soon as you can.
Karen hangs up, putting the phone down on the kitchen table.
She leans against the counter, exasperated.
Then her attention turns to THE BOOK she found in the closet.
Karen can't resist.   She opens it.
THE BOOK is a large journal, filled with elegant Japanese
writing. Karen flips through it, stopping on --"
78,KAREN (INTO PHONE),78,"A PHOTOGRAPH.   A handsome young man, smiling at the camera.
We recognize him.   It's PETER, from the opening scene."
79,KAREN (INTO PHONE),79,"Karen walks to the front door, reaching out to unlock it --
-- but she pauses, realizing something.
She reaches into her pocket, pulling out THE PHOTO she found.
It only takes a second to verify --
-- THE BOY in the photo is the one she found in the closet.
Karen lowers the photo, bewildered.    Then she looks up,
startled by --
THE BOY. He's kneeling on the second floor landing above,
watching her through the bars of the metal railing. Creepy.
Karen takes a step forward, forcing a smile."
80,KAREN (IN JAPANESE),80,"Hello there.
Really creepy.
The boy just stares at her."
81,KAREN (IN JAPANESE),81,My name is Karen. What's yours?
82,KAREN (IN JAPANESE),82,"Toshio.
Before she can respond --
RING! RING!   The phone in the next room startles her."
83,KAREN (IN JAPANESE),83,"Karen enters the room as the ANSWERING MACHINE picks up, the
voices of a happy couple on the GREETING (in English):"
84,MATTHEW & JENNIFER (ON MACHINE),84,"""Konnichiwa! Matt and Jennifer
aren't around, leave a message."""
85,SUSAN (ON MACHINE),85,"""Hey, guys, it's Susan. Matt, are
you there? Pick up..."
86,(MORE),86,"Okay, well, I'm leaving work now so
you can try my cell, or just call
me at home later.""
The caller pauses. Karen steps closer to the phone base,
curious, listening:"
87,SUSAN (ON MACHINE),87,"""I just wanted to make sure Mom is
okay. Yesterday was... a bit
weird, and -- I'm just a little
worried.""
Karen, reluctant but realizing she should pick up, reaches
for the phone...
...but the PHONE BASE is empty.   The cordless is missing.
As Karen tries to figure out how to answer with the base:"
88,SUSAN (ON MACHINE),88,"""Listen, just give me a call when
you can, okay?""
CLICK.   Too late -- the caller hangs up.
Silence returns to the room... but not completely.     Karen
hears the soft sound of WHISPERING from nearby.
Beyond her, we see a PALE FACE (KAYAKO) pressed against the
frosted window of the sliding door of the TATAMI ROOM.
The face pulls away from the glass just before Karen turns
towards it. But the sound of WHISPERING continues.
As she slowly walks to the door, we can make out some words:"
89,SUSAN (ON MACHINE),89,"...I've told them over and over...
I've told them over and over...
Karen listens for a moment, then slides the door open."
90,SUSAN (ON MACHINE),90,"It's very dark in the room -- the lights have been turned
off. Emma, sitting up in bed, turns towards Karen."
91,KAREN,91,"Emma, who were you talking to?"
92,KAREN,92,"That's when Karen notices THE INDENTATION in the mattress,
across from where Emma is sitting. Where someone else would
be, if the old woman was having a conversation.
Emma looks up at Karen with pleading eyes."
93,EMMA,93,"I just want her to leave me alone.
Karen sits down next to her."
94,KAREN,94,"You should get some rest, Emma.
She helps Emma lie back --
-- but as the old woman's eyes move to the ceiling, they
suddenly grow wide, her mouth opening in fear --
-- Karen follows her gaze, looking up --
-- and she SCREAMS, falling off the mattress, backing away --
A MURKY BLACKNESS is lowering from the ceiling. Formless at
first, but flowing and shifting... like a FIGURE draped with
black silk. Drifting down until the shadowy ""head"" is only
inches from Emma's terrified face.
And then the ""head"" slowly turns, rotating towards Karen.
In the midst of the blackness are TWO DISEMBODIED EYES.
Filled with an intense rage. Focused directly on Karen.
Off Karen's NERVE-SHATTERING SCREAM, we..."
95,KAREN,95,"MATTHEW and his wife JENNIFER are in bed. He sleeps soundly,
she doesn't. She's staring at the ceiling, listening to --
-- SOUNDS coming in through the open bedroom door. Someone
moving downstairs, fumbling around, bumping into things.
Jennifer, frustrated, lets out a sigh."
96,KAREN,96,"Matthew comes downstairs, dressed in a business suit.    He
pauses to pick up some of the RUBBISH on the stairs."
97,KAREN,97,"Jennifer watches the last drops of coffee fall into the pot.
She pours herself a mug, takes a big sip. Looks exhausted.
Matthew enters, surprised to see her."
98,KAREN,98,You're up?
99,KAREN,99,"Mmmmmm.
Matthew glances into the back room through another sliding
door -- the windows on this one are clear, not frosted like
the living room.
HIS POV:   Emma is asleep on her mattress."
100,KAREN,100,"I wonder if Mom's okay. She's been
sleeping ever since we got here."
101,KAREN,101,"Not at night.
Matthew turns to her, surprised."
102,KAREN,102,"I told you, Matthew, you can sleep
through anything.
Matthew comes over, kisses her."
103,KAREN,103,"I'm sorry, sweetheart. It was
probably just the move -- I'm sure
she'll get back on schedule.
Jennifer nods, not convinced."
104,KAREN,104,You seen my travel mug?
105,KAREN,105,"I didn't unpack it yet.
Matthew kneels down next to a pair of MOVING BOXES in the
corner -- `KITCHEN' written on the side. He explores it."
106,KAREN,106,"Maybe you should say something to
the helper, what's her name?"
107,JENNIFER,107,Yoko.
108,JENNIFER,108,"Who knows? Maybe there's something
she can suggest."
109,JENNIFER,109,Yeah.     Maybe.
110,JENNIFER,110,I miss seeing this every morning.
111,JENNIFER,111,"Hey, kiddo. You okay?"
112,JENNIFER,112,"I went for a walk yesterday. Just
to explore. I got lost and
couldn't find anyone who could
speak English, who could help me.
I felt so... stupid."
113,JENNIFER,113,"This will get easier soon, for Mom,
for all of us. I promise."
114,JENNIFER,114,Or else?
115,JENNIFER,115,"Or else I'll tell the company it's
just not working out, and that
we're going back to the States with
or without my old job. They can
get someone else to crunch their
numbers."
116,MATTHEW,116,"But until then -- promise me you'll
give it a good try, okay Jen?"
117,JENNIFER,117,Deal.
118,JENNIFER,118,"The door opens and Matthew walks outside, stopping to look at
a familiar BICYCLE, leaning against the house near the door."
119,MATTHEW,119,Is this Yoko's bike?
120,JENNIFER,120,I think so.
121,MATTHEW,121,"It's been here all night.
Matthew rolls the bike from the porch to the gate, leaning it
against the wall (where we saw it earlier).
He turns back to Jennifer, giving her a kiss."
122,MATTHEW,122,"I'll probably be home late, maybe
around nine or so.
Jennifer gives him a look."
123,JENNIFER,123,"I knew you'd forget.
Matthew pauses, looks back blankly.    Jennifer just smiles."
124,JENNIFER,124,"Dinner, your sister?    At seven?"
125,MATTHEW,125,Oh yeah.   Right.
126,JENNIFER,126,You were going to cook.
127,MATTHEW,127,"I have a big conference.    They
usually run long.
Jennifer rolls her eyes."
128,JENNIFER,128,"I'll do the shopping. Just call me
if you're going to be late.
She goes back inside, closes the door."
129,JENNIFER,129,"Jennifer stands by a cart, looking pale under the stark
fluorescent lighting. She also looks shell-shocked.
HER POV: before her is a WALL OF JAPANESE PRODUCTS. Barely
a lick of English on any of the brightly-colored packages.
Jennifer is, in a word, clueless. She looks around for
assistance -- but she's lost in a whirl of Japanese faces.
She tentatively reaches towards a bowl-shaped package.
Studies the Japanese writing.
Stealing a glance around her, she quietly tears open a corner
of the bowl. Peeks inside. Sniffs it. She smiles."
130,JENNIFER,130,"CLOSE ON the same package, a microwaveable soup bowl, now
open with a spoon sticking out of it. Resting, with a glass
of water, atop the kotatsu table.
PAN TO REVEAL a pair of feet on the lip of a MOVING BOX next
to the table. It's Jennifer, asleep on the couch.
A CLATTERING sound wakes her, followed by the sound of
FOOTSTEPS running away. We PULL BACK as Jennifer sees her
bowl, and the glass next to it, have been knocked over.
She sits up, looking into the TATAMI ROOM. Emma sits on the
edge of her mattress, staring blankly at her.
Jennifer gets up, sternly walks over."
131,JENNIFER,131,"If you need something, all you have
to do is say so --
She stops short as she sees...
FOOTPRINTS. Formed from the broth, and noodles, of her
spilled soup. They're the footprints of a child.
And they lead away from the back room, down the main hallway."
132,JENNIFER,132,Jennifer looks back up to see Emma watching her.
133,JENNIFER,133,"Jennifer follows the DAMP FOOTPRINTS. They're getting
lighter, and cease altogether in the foyer.
She stands there for a moment, bewildered. Then she tenses,
as if sensing she's being watched. She slowly turns to see --
-- A BLACK CAT. Sitting on the first landing of the stairs.
Staring at her with bright yellow eyes.
As Jennifer takes a step towards it --
TWO CHILD'S HANDS reach around the corner, and pick up the
cat, pulling it out of view.
Jennifer freezes."
134,JENNIFER,134,"Who's -- who's there?
No response. She walks up the stairs and looks around the
corner. Nothing there.
She takes a deep breath, and starts to climb."
135,JENNIFER,135,"Reaching the top, Jennifer catches a glimpse of a familiar
BOY running into the FRONT ROOM.
She slowly walks towards the open door -- we can't see inside
the room from the hallway. But she pauses as she hears --
THUD.   THUD.   The same rhythmic thumping that Karen heard.
After a moment, Jennifer steps inside the room, disappearing
from our sight.
We hear her suddenly draw a GASP.
A beat. As we DRIFT CLOSER to the doorway, we notice
something strange: the room appears to be growing darker.
A SHARP BREATHING can be heard from inside... quick, panicked
gulps of air. Growing faster.
Just as we reach the doorway, the harsh breathing stops."
136,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04   20A.,136,"Matthew enters from work, jacket slung over his shoulder."
137,MATTHEW,137,"Sorry I'm late, it took awhile to
wrap things up.
He leaves his briefcase by the door and turns to the hall --
-- noticing the house is completely DARK."
138,MATTHEW,138,Jen?   Susan?
139,MATTHEW,139,"Matthew turns on the lights. The room has reverted to its
messy state, even worse than before.
He looks down at A PICTURE, formerly hanging on the wall, now
lying on the ground. The glass is broken."
140,MATTHEW,140,"What the hell? --
He quickly goes to the BACK ROOM. Emma sits on the edge of
her bed, dazed and staring. In the darkness."
141,MATTHEW,141,"Mom?   Are you alright?
No answer.    He kneels down next to her."
142,MATTHEW,142,"Where's Jennifer, Mom?
Still nothing.      He surveys the mess in the room.   Angrily:"
143,MATTHEW,143,"Did Yoko come today, Mom?
Remember? The pretty girl?
He gets to his feet, looking at the SPILLED SOUP in the
living room, now hardened and crusty."
144,MATTHEW,144,"OVER THE RAILING:     Matthew re-enters the foyer, looking up."
145,MATTHEW,145,"Jen?   Are you up there?
He climbs up the stairs, walking to --"
146,MATTHEW,146,"Matthew stands in the doorway of the dark room.   He tries the
light switch. Nothing happens."
147,MATTHEW,147,"Dammit.
He slowly enters, feeling his way through the room. We can
barely make him out in the darkness... we see the shape of
THE BED by a window...
Matthew feels his way to a table next to the bed.   Switches
on a small lamp --
-- JENNIFER IS RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. Lying in bed, staring wide-
eyed at the ceiling. Matthew, startled, falls backwards."
148,MATTHEW,148,"Jennifer?    What is it --
Matthew rushes to her, shaking her. She's unresponsive. The
only sign she's alive is that HER FEARFUL EYES slowly fix on
him. Her mouth opens, as if she's trying to speak."
149,MATTHEW,149,"What's wrong? What happened???
She tries harder to form words, but can only produce a CROAK."
150,MATTHEW,150,I'll... I'll call an ambulance...
151,MATTHEW,151,"Matthew runs into the kitchen grabbing A LARGE BOOK on one of
the moving boxes. The Japanese equivalent of a YELLOW PAGES.
He whips it open -- hardly a word of English in it."
152,MATTHEW,152,"A stack of BOOKS sit on the very top of a tall bookshelf.
Scissors and a roll of DUCT TAPE rest atop them.
Matthew pushes everything aside to get at a JAPANESE/ENGLISH
DICTIONARY underneath. The DUCT TAPE falls to the floor.
He tears across the room to THE PHONE BASE -- but the
cordless phone is missing."
153,MATTHEW,153,Dammit!
154,MATTHEW,154,"Matthew re-enters, out of breath. He sits next to Jennifer,
who hasn't moved. Puts a hand on her chest to make sure
she's still breathing. She is."
155,MATTHEW,155,"Jesus Christ...
He looks through the dictionary, finding the word he needs:"
156,MATTHEW,156,"`Ambulance'... ""kyukyusha"".
Then he quickly rips open the Yellow Pages --
-- seeing, in plain English, `EMERGENCY' on the first page.
Below that: `FIRE/AMBULANCE -- DIAL 119'.
He drops the book and reaches across the bed for a phone, on
a table at the far side --
-- THE BOY (TOSHIO) stands up, between Matthew and the phone.
But he looks different from before: his skin is discolored,
his lips and eyes are ringed and sullen."
157,MATTHEW,157,"Who are you? What -- what are you
doing here?
Toshio makes a STRANGE SOUND. Looks at Jennifer, then turns
to Matthew, SNARLING at him like a CAT.
Matthew, shocked, falls backwards off the bed, hitting the
table with the lamp. It drops to the ground --"
158,MATTHEW,158,"-- and TOSHIO'S SHADOW, cast by the fallen light, begins to
STRETCH AND GROW across the ceiling. The shadow creeps over
Jennifer, shifting and coming towards Matthew --
-- Matthew grabs the lamp.    He reaches it, holding it up --
At first, it looks like both Jennifer and Toshio have
disappeared. But then --
-- Jennifer, suddenly back on the bed, SITS UPRIGHT, jerkily,
as if she's been yanked up and forward. Her mouth is wide
and gasping --
-- and then she falls back onto the bed.     Dead.
Matthew, stunned, backs away from the bed, against the
closet. Terrified, he doesn't notice --
-- the THUD THUD sound growing around him.     Then --
-- TOSHIO'S HEAD comes into frame behind him. Matthew hears
a GROWLING SOUND and turns, seeing Toshio right there! --"
159,MATTHEW,159,"The DOORBELL rings.   Then a few more times.
SUSAN (American, late 20s) enters, with two bottles of wine."
160,SUSAN,160,"Hello?
She kicks off her shoes."
161,SUSAN,161,You guys in the kitchen?
162,SUSAN,162,"Susan walks in, puts the wine on the table.     Looks around."
163,SUSAN,163,"I thought you guys were gonna cook!
She goes into the BACK ROOM.    Sits next to Emma."
164,SUSAN,164,"Hi, Mom.    How are you feeling?
Emma turns to her with her usual vacant look."
165,SUSAN,165,"I guess I came at a bad time, huh?"
166,SUSAN,166,"Twisting a corkscrew into a wine bottle, Susan leans into the
foyer, yelling upstairs:"
167,SUSAN,167,"I'll give you guys one minute to
finish whatever you're doing up
there and get your butts down here.
As she heads back towards the kitchen, we CRANE UP to see --
MATTHEW. He's walking down the second floor hall. He looks
different: the expression on his face is troubled, occupied.
And he's dragging his dead wife's body.   By the hair.
He pulls her inside the REAR ROOM -- the doorway looks more
imposing, more ominous, than before. It's dark and
malevolent, the threshold to a secret that won't stay buried.
We CRANE BACK DOWN to see Susan in the kitchen.   She's poured
a glass of wine and sighs impatiently.
She walks back down the hall into the foyer."
168,SUSAN,168,"I mean it, guys.
Silence from upstairs.   Shaking her head:"
169,SUSAN,169,"Well, I warned you. Prepare to be
emotionally scarred.
She starts up the stairs and turns the first corner --
-- MATTHEW is sitting there, hands on his knees, looking
harried. Susan YELPS."
170,SUSAN,170,"Matthew!   Don't scare me like that!
He's shaking slightly.   His eyes drift up to hers."
171,SUSAN,171,What's going on?   Where's Jennifer?
172,"Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      26.
MATTHEW",172,She went out. Something came up.
173,SUSAN,173,"I hope she's not long.    I'm
absolutely starving."
174,SUSAN,174,"I knew it. You guys forgot to go
shopping, didn't you?"
175,MATTHEW,175,I'm sorry.     This is a bad time.
176,SUSAN,176,Are you okay? What's going on?
177,MATTHEW,177,You should go.
178,SUSAN,178,Did something happen?    What's --
179,MATTHEW,179,"She doesn't love me... she never
loved me..."
180,SUSAN,180,What are you talking about?
181,SUSAN,181,"Stop it, Matthew."
182,MATTHEW,182,Leave me alone.
183,SUSAN,183,"Matthew, please --"
184,MATTHEW,184,"GO AWAY!!!
Susan fumbles with the front door. She gets it open and runs
out just before Matthew reaches her.
ON MATTHEW: he stands there, head tilted down, for a moment.
Then he straightens. Slowly closes the front door.
Matthew heads back upstairs. He reaches the second floor and
opens the door to the rear bedroom.
The room beyond is dark. But A DARK FIGURE is visible,
standing in the far corner, facing Matthew.
He steps inside, and the door slowly swings shut behind him."
185,MATTHEW,185,"It's an overcast afternoon.  Swollen clouds hang low over
The House. It looks a bit more imposing than usual.
THE MAILBOX is adorned with the Japanese equivalent of a ""For
Sale"" sign -- weather-worn, and looks like it's been there
for years.
SUZUKI (30s, Japanese), a Real Estate agent, waits by the
gate. Then he notices something. Waves, and smiles.
It's SUSAN, approaching with MATTHEW, JENNIFER and EMMA.
Susan shakes Suzuki's hand and they exchange a greeting in
Japanese. She turns to her brother."
186,SUSAN,186,"This is Suzuki-san, he's the Real
Estate broker.
Suzuki bows at Matthew and Jennifer, says something."
187,MATTHEW,187,What did he say?
188,SUSAN,188,"He said: ""welcome to Tokyo"". And
that you must be very important to
your company for them to rent this
place for you."
189,SUSAN,189,Matthew grins.   Susan rolls her eyes.
190,SUSAN,190,"Everyone enters, checking the place out. Suzuki and Susan
slip off their shoes. As Matthew steps into the foyer:"
191,SUSAN,191,Your shoes.
192,MATTHEW,192,"Oh.    Right.
He kneels down, untying his shoes.   Jennifer looks perplexed."
193,JENNIFER,193,Even in our own house?
194,SUSAN,194,"Even in your own house.
Suzuki smiles as Matthew and Jennifer take off their shoes.
Susan says something to him in Japanese and he laughs. They
walk down the hall, and Matthew and Jennifer follow."
195,SUSAN,195,"Suzuki opens the blinds, letting some light into the place.
It's not helping much -- it's still pretty dreary."
196,MATTHEW,196,"Isn't the layout great? Wait `till
you see the back room. It's
perfect for Mom -- she won't have
to deal with the stairs.
Jennifer follows him through the room.   She doesn't look
quite as enthusiastic.
Matthew slides open the door leading to the TATAMI ROOM."
197,MATTHEW,197,"Her bed won't be here until next
week, but we can put the mattress
on the floor. What do you think?
Jennifer warms a bit.   The wooden room is beautiful.
Susan asks Suzuki a question in Japanese, and he responds."
198,SUSAN,198,"He says no one has lived in this
house for three years."
199,JENNIFER,199,"Why?
Susan asks Suzuki in Japanese.    He shrugs."
200,JENNIFER,200,"Ex-pen-sive.
Matthew suddenly realizes:"
201,MATTHEW,201,"Where's Mom?
We slowly CRANE UP to the SECOND FLOOR HALL, moving towards
the REAR ROOM at the end. The door is ajar."
202,MATTHEW,202,"Susan comes up the stairs, worried."
203,SUSAN,203,Mom?   Where are you?
204,SUSAN,204,"Susan looks inside -- Emma isn't there. She's about to leave
when something catches her attention. She walks to
THE CLOSET. The door is open. Susan kneels down, looking at
something inside it. She picks it up --
-- it's the CERAMIC CAT Karen found earlier. As Susan
examines it, she notices something on the wall of the closet
(which we don't see). Her face softens, and she smiles."
205,SUSAN,205,Did you get her?
206,SUSAN,206,"Take a pill, will ya?
Susan stands and walks out of the room. But we stay in the
closet, PANNING TO REVEAL the closet wall. It's covered with
BLACK CRAYON, low to the ground, the work of a child. The
images are dozens of BLACK CATS."
207,SUSAN,207,"Emma stands in the dead center of the empty bedroom.
Looking directly up at the ceiling.
Susan enters, placing the ceramic cat on THE SHELF where
Karen found it earlier. Except Susan faces it INTO THE ROOM."
208,SUSAN,208,"C'mon, Mom. You know what the
doctor said about stairs.
She takes Emma's hand, but the old woman doesn't move.
Matthew and Jennifer enter, worried."
209,MATTHEW,209,She okay?
210,SUSAN,210,"Mom?   What is it?
Everyone follows her gaze to the ceiling.   Only Emma has the
unmistakable look of dread on her face.
A long beat."
211,SUSAN,211,"Suzuki walks from the kitchen into the hallway, giving the
place one final look-over.
He pauses by the open bathroom door.   Looks inside."
212,SUSAN,212,"Suzuki enters, looking at THE TUB:    filled to the brim.
After a moment, Suzuki kneels down next to the bathtub.     He
pulls the thin CHAIN connected to the rubber stopper --
-- but the end of the chain comes out of the water.      Hmmm.
It's not connected after all.
Suzuki eyes the plug at the bottom of the tub.
Then he takes off his jacket.   Rolls up his shirt sleeve.
And reaches into the water for the rubber stopper.
It's just out of reach.
He rolls up his sleeve a little more.   Reaches deeper --
-- suddenly there's a BURST OF SOUND: a dull THUMPING,
something THRASHING in water, the SCREAMING of a YOUNG BOY,
voice MUFFLED by water --
-- Suzuki recoils as water SPLASHES UP around him --
-- he falls away from the tub in horror, landing on his butt.
THE BATHTUB: Filled to the brim.     Still and silent.    Not so
much as a ripple on the surface.
That couldn't have just been his imagination, could it?
As he slowly stands, he sees something out of the corner of
his eye --
-- a DEAD CAT, bloody and torn, in the corner of the room."
213,SUSAN,213,"As Suzuki backs away from it, eyes widening in horror, he's
startled by --
MATTHEW, standing in the doorway.   Beaming at him."
214,MATTHEW,214,"It's perfect. We'll take it.
Suzuki looks back to the corner.    There's no dead cat.
A RINGING SOUND comes into focus -- the BEEPING of a phone,
waiting for someone to pick up and make the connection..."
215,MATTHEW,215,"It's after-hours in this office space: CUBICLES fill the
center, surrounded by glass-windowed OFFICES. The glittering
lights of the Tokyo cityscape beyond show a hell of a view.
One light still burns in an office towards the end --
-- SUSAN'S OFFICE. She's working late. She wears a phone
headset while she types lines of code into her computer.
No one's answering.   A familiar answering machine picks up:"
216,MATTHEW & JENNIFER (ON MACHINE),216,"""Konnichiwa! Matt and Jennifer
aren't around, leave a message."""
217,MATTHEW & JENNIFER (ON MACHINE),217,"Hey, guys, it's Susan. Matt, are
you there? Pick up... Okay, well,
I'm leaving work now so you can try
my cell, or just call me at home
later.
She pauses.   Leans back, away from the keyboard."
218,MATTHEW & JENNIFER (ON MACHINE),218,"I just wanted to make sure Mom is
okay. Yesterday was..."
219,(MORE),219,"a bit weird, and -- I'm just a
little worried. Listen, just give
me a call when you can, okay?
She hangs up, taking the headset off.   Concerned."
220,(MORE),220,"Susan walks through the hallway. She hears a strange
scraping sound -- it sounds as though something is being
dragged.
Susan turns around, but the hallway looks normal. Is it just
her imagination?
The sound starts again, coming closer. Susan gets scared and
opens the door to the emergency stairwell beside her."
221,(MORE),221,"The hallway is chilly -- Susan shivers. She's about to start
walking down when she looks up, noticing THE LIGHTS at the
top floor FLICKERING.
A wind suddenly blows through the center of the stairwell
with an eerie ROAR.
Susan looks disconcerted as she starts walking down...
Then we hear the SCRAPING SOUND again. Startled, Susan
pauses and looks down, over the railing.
There's nothing there -- but the sound continues, growing
louder, like something is moving up towards her."
222,SUSAN,222,"Is anybody there?
Just then, the lights on the top floor finally GO OUT.
Susan's breath catches in her throat as she looks up --
The lights on the next floor go out. And the next. The
darkness above growing closer with each darkening floor.
Susan nervously looks back down -- the SCRAPING is even
closer. And then, for an instant, she sees A SKINNY PALE
HAND on the railing two floors down.
Terrified, Susan starts to back up -- but stops as she
realizes that the darkness from above is almost upon her."
223,SUSAN,223,"Then Susan sees A FINGERTIP of the hand at the corner of the
floor where she stands, and A HEAD COVERED WITH BLACK HAIR
slowly crawling up on the wall.
Susan's mouth opens in a silent screen. With nowhere to
escape, she opens the same door and rushes back into the
hallway --"
224,SUSAN (IN JAPANESE),224,"In the stairs... there was...
something... a strange person...
all the lights were going out..."
225,SUSAN,225,Please. Help me.
226,GUARD (IN JAPANESE),226,I'll take a look. Wait here.
227,GUARD (IN JAPANESE),227,"Susan takes a breath and sits down, trying to relax. It's
obvious that she feels safer, here in the Security Room.
Then she notices movement on one of the SECURITY MONITORS --
ON THE SCREEN: -- the GUARD continues down the 10TH FLOOR
HALL, stopping at the door to the stairwell.
Susan leans toward the monitor for a better view.
ON THE SCREEN: the Guard opens the stairwell door and leans
inside, checking it out.
ON SUSAN:   her eyes are glued to the screen.   Waiting.
ON THE SCREEN: the Guard, finding nothing out of the
ordinary, closes the door and continues on down the hall.
SUSAN leans back, exhaling.    Relieved.
Then the video CRACKLES with a sudden quick burst of static.
And Susan GASPS, sitting upright, as she sees --
ON THE SCREEN:   the stairwell door OPENS AGAIN.   And then --
-- something DARK moves out of the stairwell, entering the
hallway.
ON SUSAN: she recoils from the screen in horror, unable to
tear her gaze away. Her mouth opens in a silent scream, her
eyes widening as she watches --
-- and then she finds the strength to get to her feet."
228,GUARD (IN JAPANESE),228,"Susan bursts out of the security room and runs through the
empty lobby, towards the front doors."
229,GUARD (IN JAPANESE),229,"Susan rushes out of the front doors and runs to the street.
She frantically hails a cab and gets in."
230,GUARD (IN JAPANESE),230,"Susan presses herself in the corner of the back seat, purse
clutched tightly in her white knuckles."
231,GUARD (IN JAPANESE),231,"A shifting wash of colors flood the taxi: the NEON LIGHTS of
the surrounding buildings tower above, threatening to swallow
her whole."
232,GUARD (IN JAPANESE),232,"Susan rushes through the front doors, clutching her purse
strap with both hands. Shaken, just wanting to get home.
She runs to the elevator and jabs the button for her floor."
233,GUARD (IN JAPANESE),233,"Susan tries to regain her composure as the elevator rises.
She closes her eyes and leans against the wall --
-- not noticing A FAMILIAR PALE JAPANESE BOY looking at her
through the window of every floor she passes --
Toshio. He's standing CLOSER TO THE WINDOW with each floor.
Until finally, he's RIGHT NEXT TO THE GLASS --
The elevator stops at her floor:    no little boy this time."
234,GUARD (IN JAPANESE),234,"Susan gets out of the elevator, moving quickly to her
apartment at the end of the hall.
She chances a look over her shoulder as she puts the key in
her lock. Then she goes in and closes the door."
235,GUARD (IN JAPANESE),235,"Susan enters. She takes a long, deep breath. Safe at home.
She sits at her kitchen table, laying her purse down.
Her eyes go to the BROKEN CHAIN still hanging from the strap,
with some rabbit's foot fur lodged in the links.
Susan's home phone RINGS, and she jumps.    She stares at it
for a moment, then tentatively answers:"
236,SUSAN (INTO PHONE),236,Hello?
237,MATTHEW (PHONE),237,It's me.
238,SUSAN (INTO PHONE),238,Matthew!   Are you alright?
239,MATTHEW (PHONE),239,"I'm downstairs. What number are
you again?"
240,SUSAN (INTO PHONE),240,"702.   I'll buzz you in.
She presses a button on the phone, and is about to hang up --
Almost immediately there's a LOUD KNOCK at her door. She
gets to her feet, surprised. How did he get up so fast?
Susan goes to the door and looks through the peephole.
HER POV: Matthew's face, distorted by the fish-eye glass.
He's looking into the peephole, with a sneer on his face.
Susan opens the door."
241,SUSAN,241,"I don't know what you're up to, but
this is not cool --
She catches her breath.   THERE'S NO ONE THERE.
Then the phone emits the THROATY CROAKING sound.   Quickly
growing louder and LOUDER...
Susan cries out and drops the phone. It BREAKS OPEN on the
hallway floor as Susan slams her apartment door."
242,SUSAN,242,"Susan quickly draws the chain lock. Then she builds the
courage to step forward, and look through the peephole --
HER POV: the phone lies broken in the middle of the floor.
Otherwise, the hallway is empty.
Susan backs away from the door, shaking in fright.
Breathing hard, she backs into --"
243,SUSAN,243,"Susan enters, turning off her cell phone and unplugging the
bedroom phone from the wall.
Then she retreats to the safety of her bed, eyes on --
THE APARTMENT DOOR, next to the kitchen.    Silence.
Susan's breathing slows. But she looks around the room,
still anxious -- it's too quiet in here. Her panic builds.
But she's alone in the room, isn't she?
As we MOVE IN on Susan, the room starts to become quieter.
The SOUND OF TRAFFIC from outside, the HUMMING REFRIGERATOR
in the kitchen... everything fades to a stifling silence.
And Susan notices, all right.    Her breath, now suddenly loud,
catches in her throat.
A long moment of silence.   Then --
-- DRIP.   DRIP.
It's coming from the KITCHEN SINK.
Susan stares at it.   She finally stands, and --"
244,SUSAN,244,"-- slowly walks into THE KITCHEN. She reaches out and turns
the faucet handle. Tightens it. The dripping stops.
Relieved, Susan turns away --
-- DRIP.   DRIP.   It begins again.   Louder, more intense.
Scared, Susan turns back to the sink. Water is now GUSHING
OUT from the faucet, filling up a bowl in the sink.
She slowly reaches out a hand and turns the faucet, as
tightly as she can manage --
-- tighter... tighter... straining with the effort..
Until the water stops.   Only then does she let go --
-- just then, a CHILD'S PALE HAND quietly rises to the
surface from water in the bowl, and starts VIOLENTLY
SPLASHING the surface."
245,SUSAN,245,Susan screams and runs back to her bedroom --
246,SUSAN,246,"She lies down, shivering, pulling the quilt to her chin.      A
final retreat."
247,SUSAN,247,"Please... stop it...
The SPLASHING SOUNDS in the kitchen continue for a while.
Then, it suddenly stops.
Susan is so terrified that she almost faints.
Then her breathing stops.   Her eyes widen.
Her hand reaches up under her pillow, feeling around --
-- and she comes out with HER LUCKY RABBIT'S FOOT.
The one she left behind in the stairwell.
Susan suddenly CRIES OUT, her head tilting back, her body
abruptly going stiff. We soon see why:
A LUMP begins to rise at the foot of the bed. A big one.
Moving slowly up Susan's body. Reaching the edge of the
quilt, which slowly rises --
-- revealing a QUICK FLASH of the PALE FACE OF THE JAPANESE
WOMAN WITH LONG DARK HAIR on top of her!
Susan SCREAMS, and is abruptly pulled under the covers --"
248,SUSAN,248,"Dark and still.   Lying in wait.   Completely silent, except --
-- someone's KNOCKING on the front door."
249,SUSAN,249,They're still KNOCKING.
250,SUSAN,250,"Apparently, whoever's KNOCKING isn't going to give up --
-- the DOOR HANDLE jiggles.   But it's locked."
251,SUSAN,251,"Karen's CELL PHONE lays on the table in the foreground.
Beyond is the hallway, and the front door."
252,SUSAN,252,"The knocking has stopped.    Silence.
Then Karen's cell phone suddenly LIGHTS UP, ringing.
It rings four times, then goes to voice mail."
253,SUSAN,253,"A new SOUND breaks the silence: movement outside. Crunching
footsteps on gravel, someone brushing past tree limbs.
A SHADOW falls over the window.   A face looks inside --
-- it's ALEX, Karen's boss. He walks away from the window
and continues down the side of the house --
-- we TRACK down the hallway, past the bathroom, through the
kitchen, following his progress into --
THE BACK ROOM: Alex is visible through the sliding door
leading to the back porch. He peers inside.
HIS POV: A FIGURE covered head-to-toe in a white sheet lies
on the mattress. Unmoving.
Alex tries the sliding door -- it's open.     He steps inside."
254,ALEX,254,"Karen?
Silence greets him.   He stares down at the figure in the bed.
Alex licks his lips, nervous.   Finally walks to the mattress,
kneeling down next to it.
Raises a hand and grabs the sheet.      Raises it over the head --
-- it's Emma. As we last saw her, eyes on the ceiling, mouth
and eyes wide open in fear.
But now it's clear, from the tache noire in the eyes, the
blanched skin, the rigidity of her body: she's dead.
Alex falls back onto his butt, staring at Emma.     He pulls
himself away from the corpse --
-- and freezes.    There's something right behind him.
He whirls around --
-- it's KAREN.    In the corner, looking pale and dazed."
255,ALEX,255,"Two POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE are parked out front.
An UNMARKED CAR pulls up, and DETECTIVE NAKAGAWA (40s) exits
the passenger side. He looks up at The House with dread.
The driver, DETECTIVE IGARASHI (30s), moves next to him."
256,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),256,"I can handle this myself, you know.
It's just a routine call. I don't
know why you wanted to come.
He turns to Nakagawa, awaiting a response. He doesn't get
one. Nakagawa just stares up at The House."
257,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),257,"The house feels completely different: all the interior
lights are on, a few POLICE OFFICERS mill about, two EMTs
wheel EMMA'S BODY out the front door on a gurney.
Alex sits at the kitchen table, frazzled.   He turns to --
-- KAREN. She's sitting in the living room, wrapped in a
blanket, being attended to by a FEMALE NURSE and speaking
with Nakagawa and Igarashi, who is taking notes on a pad.
Karen says something and the Detective looks over at Alex.
Then he speaks to the Nurse, who helps Karen to her feet.
Nakagawa and Igarashi enter the kitchen.    In perfect English:"
258,NAKAGAWA,258,"I am Detective Nakagawa. This is
Detective Igarashi, my assistant."
259,ALEX,259,Is Karen okay?
260,NAKAGAWA,260,"She is very shaken. We would like
her to stay in the hospital
tonight, under evaluation."
261,NAKAGAWA,261,Do you know these people?
262,ALEX,262,"Matthew Williams, and his wife
Jennifer. He's Emma's son, the
woman Karen came here to see."
263,NAKAGAWA,263,When was the last time you saw him?
264,ALEX,264,"I met them when they came to
register. It's standard procedure,
though the visits were arranged by
his employer. He works at --"
265,NAKAGAWA,265,"We've spoken with his employer.   He
did not show up for work today."
266,NAKAGAWA,266,"If you could please come by
tomorrow to make a statement, the
address is there, at the bottom --"
267,ALEX,267,"(realizing)
Yoko."
268,NAKAGAWA,268,I'm sorry?
269,ALEX,269,"Karen was a substitute -- Yoko is
the girl who is normally in charge
of Emma. She's also been missing
from work."
270,NAKAGAWA,270,For how long?
271,ALEX,271,For the last two days.
272,ALEX,272,I think I saw her bike outside.
273,ALEX,273,"Nakagawa stands outside by the front gate, looking at --"
274,ALEX,274,"-- YOKO'S BICYCLE.   He looks down at it, frowning.
Then he suddenly cocks his head.    As if sensing something.
He turns to look up at A WINDOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR.
It's empty."
275,ALEX,275,"Igarashi stands by the ANSWERING MACHINE.    The message
counter reads `1'. He presses PLAY.
SUSAN'S MESSAGE replays, and he listens carefully. As it
ends, he turns to see NAKAGAWA standing in the doorway."
276,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),276,"That's Matthew's sister.
He shows Nakagawa a PHOTO of Matthew and Susan, brother and
sister, grinning at the camera."
277,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),277,"This must be her.
The look on Nakagawa's face is grave."
278,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),278,"Call her at work, then at home. If
no one answers, send someone to --
He trails off, looking down at --
-- the PHONE BASE.   The cordless phone is missing.
Nakagawa reaches down, pressing the `LOCATE' button.
A distant BEEPING SOUND can be heard.
Everyone in the room stops what they're doing.    They listen."
279,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),279,"Nakagawa and Igarashi enter from the hallway, followed by
their men. They look up to the second floor.
The BEEPING is definitely coming from upstairs."
280,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),280,"Nakagawa and Igarashi come upstairs, their men following
close behind.
They pause in the hallway for a moment. Then Nakagawa walks
into the rear room (Matthew's office). The BEEPING is close.
He stands there, in the center of the room, listening.
Then he looks up, at the ceiling.    Everyone follows suit.
Nakagawa turns to the CLOSED CLOSET DOORS."
281,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),281,"He quickly pulls open the door.   The closet is empty.
Nakagawa looks up, peering into the darkness.
HIS POV:   the ATTIC PANEL yawns wide open.
And right next to it are FOUR LONG GROOVES in the ceiling.
As if something was dragged across it, right to the edge.
Something like fingernails.
Nakagawa leans out, looking at Igarashi."
282,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),282,I need your flashlight.
283,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),283,"A shaft of light from the flashlight through the open attic
access cuts through the thick darkness.
Nakagawa appears, pulling himself up into the attic.     He
swings his flashlight slowly around the room.
Igarashi comes up next to Nakagawa just as the Detective's
flashlight stops on something.
A beat as they exchange an uneasy look.
Then Nakagawa and Igarashi crawl through the darkness towards
the far corner of the space.
Two bodies are tucked into the corner.    MATTHEW AND JENNIFER."
284,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),284,"God!
Nakagawa sits in front of the bodies, examining them."
285,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),285,"What the hell... what is going on?
Nakagawa sees the beeping CORDLESS PHONE a few feet away.
SOMETHING next to it attracts Nakagawa's interest. We can't
see what it is, but there's some DEEP RED in it, and
something very WHITE --"
286,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),286,"What is that?
-- Nakagawa's eyes widen as he realizes what he's looking at."
287,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),287,"The POLICE CARS outside have attracted a small crowd.   The
TWO BODIES are being loaded into a POLICE VAN.
Nakagawa stands with THE CORONER. The CORONER'S ASSISTANT,
wearing a face mask and rubber gloves, approaches. He holds
something small, wrapped in a bloody white sheet.
The Coroner slowly unfolds the sheet. We can't see what he's
looking at -- but it elicits quite a reaction."
288,CORONER (IN JAPANESE),288,Who does this belong to?
289,NAKAGAWA   (IN JAPANESE),289,"We don't know.
The Coroner quickly re-covers the object."
290,CORONER (IN JAPANESE),290,"I can use the blood to help
identify the person.
As the Coroner and his assistant walk away:"
291,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),291,"Is it possible that someone could
live without... that?
The Coroner turns back, his face pale."
292,CORONER (IN JAPANESE),292,"Nakagawa turns away to see Igarashi approaching, talking into
a cell phone. He looks disturbed. As he hangs up:"
293,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),293,"Someone just reported another
death. It's not in our district...
but I think we should check it out.
Nakagawa realizes something's troubling his partner."
294,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),294,Why?
295,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),295,"The cause of death is not clear...
but it is the man who sold them
this house."
296,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),296,"CLOSE ON the spinning wheels of a bicycle.      A familiar one.
The pedals are being pumped by a beautiful young Japanese
woman -- this is YOKO (early 20s).
Yoko turns, riding down a small side street.      It ends, and
she rounds a corner stopping in front of --"
297,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),297,"Yoko opens the gate and walks her bike to the front door,
leaning it against the wall nearby (exactly where we saw
Matthew bump into it earlier).
She rings the door buzzer. Waits. She seems to have
expected this: she pulls a KEY from her pocket, with a
plastic LABEL on it."
298,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),298,"Yoko steps inside. She instinctively slips off her shoes.
She calls out, in decent English:"
299,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),299,"Hi, excuse me?
There's a small ENVELOPE with YOKO'S NAME resting on a small
table by the door. She takes it, opens it."

301,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         46A.,301,"The house is the least ""moved-into"" that we've seen so far:
although the main furniture is in place, MOVING BOXES are
stacked in every room, in various stages of unpacking.
But there's also an unusual amount of mess in the house -- a
disarray, much like the opening sequence, that isn't exactly
related to moving in.
Yoko surveys the room, dismayed by the mess.
Then she sees EMMA at the far end of the living room, her
back to Yoko. She's looking down at something in her hands."
302,YOKO,302,"Hi, Emma.    It's good to see you
again.
Emma turns. Looks blankly at Yoko, who approaches.
Realizing the woman doesn't remember her:"
303,YOKO,303,"My name is Yoko.
The old woman still gives no sign of recognition.   Yoko
gently takes her arm."
304,YOKO,304,"You should be in bed --
Then she sees what Emma was looking at: the roll of DUCT
TAPE. She's cut her finger on the serrated cutting blade."
305,YOKO (IN JAPANESE),305,"You shouldn't be playing with this!
Shaking her head, Yoko takes the duct tape and looks around
for a place where Emma can't get at it --
-- she puts the tape ON THE STACK OF BOOKS at the top of the
bookshelf, next to the scissors (where Matthew found them)."

307,YOKO (IN JAPANESE),307,"From the entrance, we see Yoko come out of the kitchen
holding a tray with a teapot and cup.
She walks into the BACK ROOM, looking down at Emma's bed.
The old woman must be asleep: Yoko gently lays down the
tray, quietly steps out of the room and slides the door shut.
Then Yoko moves through the LIVING ROOM to the PHONE BASE --
-- she picks up THE CORDLESS, finally where it belongs.
Yoko dials a number as she walks into THE ENTRANCE HALL.     She
begins a conversation (in Japanese) as she looks at the
scattered rubbish on the ground, shaking her head.
She climbs up to the SECOND FLOOR, pausing to kneel and pick
up some pieces of crumpled paper, chatting all the while.
THUD. THUD. Yoko pauses, turning towards the open door to
the front room. The rhythmic THUMPING continues."
308,YOKO (IN JAPANESE),308,"The room is a mess. The bed is unmade, clothes are strewn on
the floor. Looks like a storm swept through it.
Yoko stands in the doorway, listening for the THUMPING
sounds. But they've stopped.
She finishes her call and hangs up. Sighs. She sticks the
cordless phone into her pocket and starts to clean the room.
As Yoko straightens the bedspread, she hears something.
Pauses. And we hear it too --
-- a familiar THROATY CROAKING SOUND.   Quiet and muffled."
309,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         49A.,309,"HER POV: the murky blackness of the hall seems to be slowly

around all sides, not just the bottom.
Yoko backs up to the bed, still clutching the CORDLESS PHONE.
She looks back at the door, suddenly CRYING OUT --"
311,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         49A.,311,"-- A BLACK CAT sits in the doorway. Tail wrapped around
itself, sitting perfectly still, like a statue. Staring at
Yoko with its yellow eyes. Something unnatural about it.
Yoko backs away towards the closet.   Nowhere to go.
The cat suddenly HISSES AT HER --
-- and that's all Yoko can take.    In a panic, she opens the
closet door, ducks inside."
312,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         49A.,312,"Yoko slams the door shut, pulling herself up onto a raised
shelf. Breathing hard, looking down at --
-- the crack under the door.   The light is beginning to dim.
Yoko presses back into the closet, trapped.
The closet is starting to get dark.   Quickly.
Yoko looks around desperately.   Looking up, she sees --
-- THE ATTIC PANEL above her is wide open.
Caught between a rock and a hard place.   Yoko decides:
She shakily stands on the shelf and reaches up to pull
herself into the attic."
313,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         49A.,313,"Yoko's head appears. Then her shoulders.     She looks around,
but can't see a thing in the darkness.
She's about to pull herself all the way up --
-- when she hears the THROATY CROAKING SOUND.
Coming from the darkness.
Yoko stiffens, her breath catching in her throat.
ANOTHER POV: we're at the far end of the attic, suddenly and
rapidly RACING FORWARD TOWARDS YOKO...
ON YOKO:   something brushes her face.   Long, black hair.
There's a head, just inches from hers.    Almost nose-to-nose."
314,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         49A.,314,"Yoko is paralyzed with fear, eyes wide.   A long beat.
Then she reaches into her pocket, pulling out a LIGHTER.
Yoko raises it and flicks the wheel --
-- we get a glimpse of a PALE FACE, surrounded by long black
hair, eyes wide and mouth open, the THROATY SOUND suddenly
increasing in pitch and volume --
-- as the face moves forward --"
315,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         49A.,315,"Karen slowly wakes up in bed.    As her eyes clear, she sees --
DOUG. He sits on the edge of the bed, slightly slumped, his
back to her.
He slowly turns -- and a relieved smile crosses his face.     He
moves closer, and reaches out a hand."
316,DOUG,316,"It's okay.     I've got you.
Karen nods, lacing her fingers in his. But her eyes are
glazed and unfocused -- she's exhausted."
317,DOUG,317,"Your boss told me what happened.
I'm sorry.
She turns away, the memory bothering her.    Doug takes her
hand, massaging her fingers, worried."
318,DOUG,318,"I talked to your teachers. They
said you can take as much time as
you need. We could go to Kyoto for
a weekend, see those temples you're
always talking about.
Karen tries to smile back, but her heart's not in it."

320,"Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     51A.

quite simply, beyond help."
322,KAREN,322,"No, that's not what I mean..."
323,KAREN,323,That house. There was something...
324,DOUG,324,"Don't beat yourself up searching
for a greater truth, Kat. An old
woman passed away in her sleep.
It's sad, but that's all it is --"
325,KAREN,325,Is that how they said she died?
326,DOUG,326,"I'm sorry this happened to you.
But maybe, in a way, it will help
you later. Death is an unfortunate
but integral part of your future
career. There's no avoiding it.
Maybe now you'll be more... ready
for it."
327,KAREN,327,"I don't think I'll ever be ready
for something like that."
328,NAKAGAWA,328,"I'm sorry to disturb you, Miss
Davies. I was wondering if you
could answer some additional
questions?"
329,DOUG,329,I'm Doug.    Karen's boyfriend.
330,DOUG,330,You up for this?
331,KAREN,331,"(nodding:)
Why don't you find out when I can
check out of here."
332,NAKAGAWA,332,How are you feeling?
333,KAREN,333,Okay.   Tired.
334,NAKAGAWA,334,"You are an exchange student?
(Karen nods:)
And you have been volunteering at
the Health Center for...?"
335,KAREN,335,"Three months. I needed a social
welfare credit."
336,NAKAGAWA,336,"You said this was the first time
you'd been in that house?"
337,KAREN,337,Yes.
338,NAKAGAWA,338,"About the Japanese boy you said you
saw there --"
339,KAREN,339,Did you find him?
340,NAKAGAWA,340,"No, not yet. You said the boy had
been taped into the closet?"
341,KAREN,341,"Yes, that's right. He was...
holding a cat. A black cat.
(remembering:)
There was a book in the closet,
too. I think it was a journal."
342,NAKAGAWA,342,Did it belong to the boy?
343,KAREN,343,The writing. It looked feminine.
344,"Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04    54.
KAREN",344,I left it on the kitchen table.
345,NAKAGAWA,345,"I didn't see any book on the table.
Perhaps someone moved it. Did you
speak with the boy after you opened
the closet?"
346,KAREN,346,"I asked him his name.   He said
`Toshio'."
347,NAKAGAWA,347,"One more question, please."
348,NAKAGAWA,348,We found this in the room where...
349,KAREN,349,This is him. This is the boy.
350,NAKAGAWA,350,Are you certain?
351,KAREN,351,Yes.   Positive.
352,KAREN,352,Detective Nakagawa?
353,KAREN,353,"The whole time I was in that house,
I felt something was... wrong."
354,KAREN,354,What happened there?
355,NAKAGAWA,355,"The bodies of the son and daughter-
in-law of the woman you were caring
for were found in the attic.
Karen just stares at him, stunned."
356,NAKAGAWA,356,"It seems that the son killed his
wife, and then himself --
There's a KNOCK on the door. Igarashi stands in the doorway.
He speaks to Nakagawa in Japanese."
357,NAKAGAWA,357,"Please excuse me for a moment.
Nakagawa puts the photo down and steps into the hallway and
closes the door, but not all the way. Karen watches and
listens through the crack:"
358,NAKAGAWA,358,IN THE HALLWAY:   the men speak with hushed voices.
359,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),359,"We checked the apartment of Susan,
the sister. She wasn't there...
He trails off, hesitating."
360,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),360,Yes?
361,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),361,"The chain lock had been drawn from
the inside. And the deadbolt. But
we found no one in the apartment.
Nakagawa takes this in."
362,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),362,"Get the surveillance tapes from the
office building.
Igarashi nods.    But doesn't move.   After a moment, quietly:"
363,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),363,"They were the first family to live
in that house since the incident
three years ago --"
364,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),364,"Nakagawa's harsh look silences him. Then the Detective
turns, noticing KAREN watching them. He pulls the door shut."
365,IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE),365,"Nakagawa's stern voice is muffled by the closed door.    Karen
sits back in bed, disturbed.
Then her attention turns to THE FILE on the table.
She considers.   Then reaches for it.   Opens it.
It's a POLICE REPORT, in Japanese.
Karen scans it, and turns the page.     She draws a breath --
-- it's a photo of THE HOUSE. Cordoned off with police tape.
An ambulance out front. Like the scene she just left...
...only the picture is dated three years ago.
THREE DETECTIVES are visible beyond the open front door,
conferring in the entryway.
The photo of the house is attached to a POLICE REPORT, with
THREE PICTURES. A stern-looking Japanese man (TAKEO), a
somber woman (KAYAKO), and a YOUNG BOY we know very well --
Karen makes the connection. She picks up the taped-up photo
and compares it to the file... the boy and his father are the
same as in the newspaper.
Karen gently touches the ""missing"" face of KAYAKO -- then her
eyes move to the picture of THE BOY.
Her eyes widen as she reads THE JAPANESE TEXT under his face:"
366,KAREN,366,Toshio...
367,KAREN,367,"The place is quiet, completely deserted.    Except for --
-- Alex. He's behind his desk in the reception area, staring
off into space. Alex finally glances up at a clock -- it's
almost ten o'clock.
He gets up, turns off his computer, switches off the lights,
and walks around the reception desk towards --"
368,ALEX,368,Yoko?
369,ALEX,369,"What... What happened, Yoko?
Now she finally stops, two steps away.    A long beat."
370,ALEX,370,"Say something, please...
Yoko slowly raises her head towards him --
-- the lower half of her face is missing. Her jawbone has
been ripped out, her tongue hanging limply on her chest.
Alex stumbles backwards... and his foot lands right in a
puddle of blood. His legs fly out from under him and he
CRACKS HIS HEAD AGAINST THE GROUND.
HIS POV: everything goes blurry, and canted 90 degrees.       But
it looks like there's A FIGURE standing in the hallway,
watching the scene...
...a small boy holding a black cat...
Dazed, Alex plants a hand on the ground and pulls himself
into a seating position --
-- and coming face-to-face with YOKO, kneeling down directly
in front of him. Her bloody tongue dripping, lolling...
ON ALEX:   eyes wide, he opens his mouth to scream --"
371,ALEX,371,"Nakagawa sits at the desk. Exhausted, dark circles under his
eyes, he's staring down at --
THE FILE on his desk.   As if he's afraid to even open it.
But he does. He flips through the photos, pausing on that of
TOSHIO, but continuing on to THE BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO of The
House from three years ago (the one Karen saw), with the
THREE DETECTIVES.
Nakagawa turns to a FRAMED PICTURE on his desk -- it's
YOUNGER NAKAGAWA at a bar with THREE FAMILIAR DETECTIVES.
They're off-duty, grinning at the camera. Buddies.
The two photographs share THE SAME THREE DETECTIVES."
372,ALEX,372,"As Nakagawa looks at the crime scene photo, he realizes
something. He slowly stands, in shock, trembling.
The phone RINGS, startling him.
Nakagawa walks over, picks up the phone."
373,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),373,"Hello?
He listens.
His face goes blank.    He slowly lowers the phone."

375,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),375,"The CORONER sits on a stool, staring at the floor. TWO
BODIES lie under bloody white sheets on two STEEL TABLES.
Between them is a small cart -- a bloody cloth on top.
Nakagawa and Igarashi enter. The Coroner stands, nervous.
He walks to one of the tables and pulls back the sheet."
376,NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE),376,"Have you determined a cause of
death?"
377,CORONER (IN JAPANESE),377,"Not yet. The blood on his body --
isn't his. It belongs to her.
He points to the other table.    But doesn't look at it."
378,DOUG,378,"I got us a guidebook to Kyoto. I
thought maybe we'd leave tomorrow --"
379,KAREN,379,Why didn't you tell me?
380,DOUG,380,Tell you what?
381,KAREN,381,"About the bodies they found in the
attic."
382,DOUG,382,"You were recovering from a shock.
I didn't want to --"
383,DOUG,383,Karen -- wait --
384,DOUG,384,"Look, I'm sorry. I was just
worried about you, and -- I know
you, Karen."
385,KAREN,385,"The same thing happened three years
ago, Doug. To a Japanese family,
who lived in that house. They were
all found dead."
386,DOUG,386,"So you think the events are
connected?"
387,KAREN,387,How would you explain it?
388,DOUG,388,"Okay. How about this: the
American family knew about what had
happened there before, and this
knowledge subconsciously caused
them to repeat the same events."
389,DOUG,389,"It's exactly how superstitions
survive: if you walk under a
ladder and think uh-oh, you're in
for some bad luck, sure enough,
what do you know? You trip over --"
390,KAREN,390,"(heard it before:)
-- trip over the curb and sprain
your ankle."
391,DOUG,391,"Makes sense, right?"
392,KAREN,392,"Okay. Then explain this: when I
went to that house, I didn't know
anything about its past. But yet I
still saw..."
393,DOUG,393,Saw what?    Karen?
394,KAREN,394,"Emma and I were alone in that room,
but -- there was something else
there. I'm sure of it."
395,DOUG,395,"You watched a woman die, Kat.
That's a horrible thing to
experience. I can't imagine how
you must feel. But sometimes the
mind tries to cope with terrible
things in a way that distorts what
actually occurred."
396,KAREN,396,"You might be right, Doug. But I
know what I saw.
(then, faltering:)
I think I know what I saw..."
397,DOUG,397,"You just need to rest. We'll get
you home, get a good night's sleep."
398,KAREN,398,Yeah.
399,KAREN,399,"You've got class, and I'm sure I
only have to fill out a few forms
or something --"
400,DOUG,400,You sure?
401,KAREN,401,"I'm fine, Doug. Really."
402,KAREN,402,"Karen sits at her computer desk.   She looks exhausted.
Online, Karen pulls up the home page for The Japan Times, an
English-language newspaper.
She types Toshio's full name into a SEARCH window.
A LIST of links appear, filling the screen. Karen scans
them. Tries one. It's not what she's looking for.
She re-enters Toshio's name along with a year -- `2001'.
Only ONE LINK appears.   The word `MURDERED' in the headline."
403,KAREN,403,"Karen clicks it.   The article fills the screen.
As Karen reads it, we catch glimpses of names -- `Toshio',
`Kayako', `Takeo'. And an ominous phrase: ""MURDER/SUICIDE"".
Karen clicks a link marked `IMAGE'. A scanned picture of the
newspaper appears -- the article is on the front page, with
familiar photos of Toshio, Kayako and Takeo.
But then Karen's eyes drift to another picture at the bottom
of the page --
-- PETER. She quickly recognizes him from the picture she
found in the journal. His name is printed below the photo.
A picture of Peter and Maria's CONDO BUILDING is next to it.
She looks at the headline:   ""AMERICAN ENGLISH TEACHER THROWS
SELF FROM BUILDING"".
Karen scans the article, thinking.   Then she looks up at --
-- TOSHIO'S PICTURE."
404,KAREN,404,"Nakagawa is looking at the same picture, in his file.
OFFICER #1 appears in the hall.   Knocks gently on the door."

surveillance video you requested.
It takes a moment for Nakagawa to snap out of it.
He finally nods, takes the tape. He opens the envelope and
looks at the cassette. Like he doesn't want to watch it.
Then he turns to a TV/VCR combo and inserts the tape.
ON THE SCREEN: the 10TH FLOOR HALLWAY from Susan's office
building, and the door leading to the stairwell.
A beat.   The image FLICKERS for a moment.
Then the door suddenly bursts open and Susan, terrified, runs
from the stairwell and down the hall.
ON NAKAGAWA:   he fast-forwards the video.   Until --"
406,OFFICER #1 (IN JAPANESE),406,"ON SCREEN: -- the SECURITY GUARD appears in the hallway.        As
Susan saw earlier, he opens the door to the stairwell and
looks inside. Then he closes the door and continues o.s.
ON NAKAGAWA:   he reaches forward to turn off the video --
ON SCREEN:   -- but then the video CRACKLES with a quick burst
of static.   And the door to the stairwell opens again.
ON NAKAGAWA: he's watching, entranced, terrified.      He can
hardly believe what he's seeing --
ON SCREEN: -- A DARK FIGURE EMERGES FROM THE STAIRWELL.    It's
the shape of a woman with long hair --
-- but the figure is BLURRY AND SHIFTING, as if the black
shadow has loosely compacted itself into the form of a human.
NAKAGAWA watches, breathless, as THE FIGURE slowly enters the
hallway, passing by, underneath the camera.
The image stops flickering.    An empty hallway now.   A beat.
Nakagawa, his hand shaking, reaches forward, about to turn
off the television set, when --
DARKNESS SUDDENLY OVERTAKES THE SCREEN, rising up from the
bottom until everything is dark. A strange HUMMING RATTLE
comes from the speakers, and the image JITTERS madly.
Nakagawa leans forward, right up to the screen, trying to
make out an image in the swirling blackness --
Two eyes open, staring at Nakagawa.
Terrified, Nakagawa stands and turns away, closing his eyes.
And when he finds the strength to look back --
-- THE EYES are still there.
Locked onto him, even though he's moved.
Unflinching.   Unblinking."

enters, carrying a bag. He closes the door behind him and
walks in, turning the corner --
-- finding Karen, looking a bit dazed, standing right there.
He's startled, but quickly recovers:"
410,DOUG,410,"I come bearing gifts.
Karen smiles weakly. She takes the bag and enters the
kitchen. He watches her go, worried. Then he notices --
HER DESK. Doug walks over, looking at the printouts she's
taped to the wall. And the photo of The House in the center.
Bewildered, he sits down, leaning forward and taking a good
look. His eyes stop on the picture of TOSHIO.
Doug turns to see Karen staring at him from the kitchen.
It's an awkward moment: he's concerned, but doesn't know
what to say. And neither does Karen.
Finally she approaches, looking at Toshio's picture:"

house, Doug. Something really bad.
(re: Peter's photo)
The boy in that house, he had a
photo of this man. He died on that
same day three years ago. I need
to talk to his wife... widow. If I
can find out what happened, or
if... maybe --"
413,DOUG,413,"Maybe, what?"
414,DOUG,414,"I'm concerned about you going out
while you're so upset --"
415,KAREN,415,"You don't understand.   I have to,
Doug."
416,DOUG,416,Why?
417,KAREN,417,"Because I've been inside that
house, Doug. Don't you get it?
I've been inside!"
418,KAREN,418,I love you. But I have to go.
419,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     70-72.,419,"The same building from the newspaper clipping.   Monolithic
against a cloudy, bleak sky.
Karen stands before it, staring up at it.
Then she walks to the intercom and looks at the directory,
finds `M. Kirk'. She activates the intercom and dials the
number. It rings a few times, and then a voice picks up:"
420,"MARIA (INTERCOM, IN JAPANESE)",420,Yes?
421,KAREN,421,I'm looking for Maria Kirk?
422,KAREN,422,Who is this?
423,KAREN,423,"My name is Karen Davies. I'm a
student at -- I'm sorry to bother
you, but I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions.
A long beat.   Karen stares at the intercom."
424,KAREN,424,Ms. Kirk?
425,KAREN,425,Questions about what?
426,KAREN,426,"I'm here because... I need to speak
with you about your husband.
When Maria's voice comes back through the intercom, she
sounds different, shaken:"
427,KAREN,427,Leave me alone.
428,KAREN,428,Maria --
429,MARIA (INTERCOM),429,"Please.
Karen stands there for a moment.   Then, as she walks away --"
430,MARIA (INTERCOM),430,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04   73.
431,MARIA,431,I'm late for work.
432,KAREN,432,I just need a couple minutes.
433,MARIA,433,Make yourself at home.
434,MARIA,434,Well?
435,KAREN,435,"Your husband, Peter.    Three years
ago he..."
436,MARIA,436,He what?
437,KAREN,437,He killed himself.
438,"Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        74A.
KAREN",438,"(almost ashamed:)
I'm... sorry."
439,MARIA,439,Thank you.
440,MARIA,440,How did you know Peter?
441,KAREN,441,I didn't.
442,MARIA,442,Then what are you doing here?
443,KAREN,443,"I think there's a connection
between your husband's death and
something that happened to me."
444,MARIA,444,What happened to you?
445,KAREN,445,It's... hard to explain.
446,KAREN,446,"Look, I know this sounds strange,
but... I don't think your husband
wanted to die."
447,MARIA,447,"(even:)
Then why would he throw himself out
a window?"
448,MARIA,448,Let me guess: `hard to explain'?
449,"Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04    74B.
MARIA",449,"I put all this behind me. I don't
want to open it back up again."
450,KAREN,450,"If that's true, then why are you
still here in Japan?"
451,MARIA,451,"Because I can't leave. I tried.
But I couldn't. Not without..."
452,MARIA,452,"He usually didn't wake up before
me. But that morning, he did. He
made coffee for us. Then he sat
there and waited for me to wake up.
And when I did, he looked me right
in the eye. And then he jumped.
The night before we'd been talking
about having children together..."
453,KAREN,453,Did you know a woman named Kayako?
454,MARIA,454,No.
455,KAREN,455,Did Peter?
456,MARIA,456,I don't think so.
457,KAREN,457,"Maybe it was someone he worked
with?"
458,MARIA,458,"Look. I've had the police up here,
I talked with Detectives, I even
hired a P.I.--

through, or what you think you know
about my husband. But I don't have
any answers. I'm sorry."
460,KAREN,460,"Please. I don't know what else to
do. Please help me."
461,MARIA,461,This is all his stuff from school.
462,MARIA,462,This was our first date.
463,KAREN,463,"(under her breath:)
Oh my God."
464,MARIA,464,What?   Did you find something?
465,MARIA,465,"The same GROUP PHOTO is in a frame on Peter's desk.
Peter stands behind the desk, using a small mirror to knot
his tie. His open door reads: `DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH'.
A CO-WORKER (20s, Japanese) enters with a stack of mail."
466,MARIA,466,Happy Monday.
467,MARIA,467,"Yeah, right. Here's your mail.
He hands it to Peter. On the top is a small BLUE ENVELOPE.
The name in the return address is `Kayako'."
468,CO-WORKER,468,"Another one, huh?"
469,PETER,469,"I don't even know her. She says I
used to tutor her, but I don't know
who the hell she is."
470,PETER (IN JAPANESE),470,Hello?   Excuse me?
471,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      79A.,471,"A familiar BOY is inside -- it's TOSHIO. His glazed and
staring eyes don't seem to notice Peter, standing right in
front of him."
472,PETER (IN JAPANESE),472,"Hello.
No reaction. There's definitely something wrong with this
boy. Peter looks beyond him, into the dark house."
473,PETER (IN JAPANESE),473,"My name is Peter. I'm here to see
your mother. Is she home?
The boy slowly straightens. His eyes focus on Peter. Then
he FALLS BACKWARDS. Startled, Peter tries to see inside:"
474,PETER (IN JAPANESE),474,"Hey!   Are you okay??? Hello???
Peter quickly goes back to the front door.   Tries the handle -
- it's unlocked. He opens the door."
475,PETER (IN JAPANESE),475,"Peter steps inside, unsure about entering uninvited."
476,PETER (IN JAPANESE),476,"Hello? Excuse me. I'm coming in.
His concern for the boy wins out. He kicks off his shoes,
and quickly walks to the open bathroom door."
477,PETER (IN JAPANESE),477,OMITTED
478,PETER (IN JAPANESE),478,"Peter enters, finding Toshio lying on the floor. He must
have been standing on the edge of a TUB by the window."
479,PETER (IN JAPANESE),479,"Are you alright?
As Peter helps the boy to his feet, he glances at the
bathtub. It's filled, literally to the brim, with water."
480,PETER (IN JAPANESE),480,"Peter holds Toshio's hand as he leads him back to a couch in
the living room."
481,PETER (IN JAPANESE),481,"Are you alone? Where are your
parents?
The boy sits in the couch, slumped over, still looking dazed.
Peter studies him, looking at the ugly BRUISES on his arms
and legs. There's also a big one around his neck."
482,PETER (IN JAPANESE),482,"What happened to you?
Peter reaches out to lift Toshio's chin, but he FLINCHES,
pulling backwards. His eyes manage to focus on Peter.
Then the boy looks away.    Lowers his head.   A long beat.
Peter's worried. This really doesn't look good.     He scans
the messy room, eyes falling on something.
He reaches down and picks up PIECES OF A PHOTOGRAPH, lying
next to a broken frame -- they've been crumpled into a ball.
ON THE PHOTO: Peter unfolds the pieces and rearranges them.
We've seen this picture before --
-- a FAMILY PORTRAIT. TOSHIO, holding a cute BLACK CAT.
Standing with his mother and father -- KAYAKO and TAKEO.
They're all beaming at the camera, a perfect, happy family.
Except that the mother's face has been torn out.
Then there's a muffled MEOW.    Peter looks over at the window.
Did that come from outside?
Another MEOW.   Peter walks to the window, looking out.
FROM OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN: a worried look crosses Peter's
face as the MEOW becomes more of a GROWL, as if in warning.
He looks outside, but can't see anything --"
483,PETER (IN JAPANESE),483,"-- but we see, over Peter's shoulder, that TOSHIO is now
LOOKING DIRECTLY AT HIM, eyes wide --
-- the MEOWING emitting from his wide open mouth --"
484,PETER (IN JAPANESE),484,"Karen enters quickly, going up to the front desk.
OFFICER #2, filling out paperwork, doesn't look up."
485,KAREN (IN JAPANESE),485,"Excuse me, I need to speak with
Detective Nakagawa.
Officer #2 looks up at her.   Blankly."
486,KAREN (IN JAPANESE),486,It's an emergency.
487,KAREN (IN JAPANESE),487,"One moment.
Officer #2 walks to the end of the desk, where two more
OFFICERS speak in hushed tones with DETECTIVE AOKI.
Officer #2 interrupts their conversation. And they all look
over at Karen. A beat. Then Detective Aoki approaches."
488,KAREN (IN JAPANESE),488,"You are asking for Detective
Nakagawa?"
489,KAREN,489,"Yes, I have important information
for him about a case...
She looks around. Everyone is watching her. The mood is
decidedly grim. She can tell something's up."
490,KAREN,490,"Detective Nakagawa is not here
right now. Can you tell me what
case this is regarding?
There's something behind the Detective's words."
491,KAREN,491,"His partner, Detective Igarashi?
Can I speak with him?"
492,KAREN,492,Aoki exchanges a look with the officers.
493,KAREN,493,"Can you tell me your name, please?
Karen looks at the somber faces in the quiet station.     She
backs away from the desk as the realization sinks in."
494,KAREN,494,"They're dead, aren't they?
Karen turns and runs for the exit."
495,KAREN,495,"Miss, wait please --
But she's long gone."
496,KAREN,496,"A reading light on the computer desk provides the only
illumination in the dark apartment.
Karen enters, standing in the doorway for a moment.     Shell-
shocked. As she slides off her coat:"
497,KAREN,497,Doug?
498,DOUG (ON MACHINE) (cont'd),498,"If all this is real to you, then
it's important to me, and I'm gonna
check that house out. So just sit
tight, I won't be long. I love
you."""
499,KAREN,499,No.
500,DOUG,500,Hello?
501,KAREN,501,Doug!   Where are you???
502,KAREN,502,Doug???
503,VOICE (O.S.),503,"Hey, Maria, it's me. Yeah, I'm
still at school..."
504,VOICE (O.S.),504,"-- PETER. She recognizes him immediately.    He's standing in
the hallway, talking on his cell phone."
505,VOICE (O.S.),505,"...I know, I'm sorry -- these staff
meetings always run over -- maybe
another ten minutes or so -- okay,
I'll be home soon -- I love you
too.
He hangs up.   Leans against the wall.   Looking into --
THE FRONT BEDROOM. Karen gasps as she sees TOSHIO through
the open door. He's sitting on the ground, making drawings
of BLACK CATS. This is his bedroom."
506,PETER,506,"Guess your mom's late, huh?
Then Toshio suddenly looks up.   Right at Karen.
Following Toshio's gaze, Peter quickly turns to face Karen.
But even though she's right there, he doesn't see her:
She's seeing something that happened three years ago.
As if sensing her presence, Peter walks right to the edge of
the stairs, looking down. Then:
A RUSTLING SOUND comes from the dark hallway. Peter turns
towards the REAR BEDROOM at the end of the hall."
507,PETER,507,"Peter stands in the doorway, looking into the MASTER BEDROOM
of Toshio's parents. His attention is drawn to something
near the door --
-- a DESK. It's got a computer, some files.     Someone's
personal work space.
Peter steps to the desk. He picks up A STACK OF PHOTOGRAPHS.
Family pictures: with father (TAKEO), mother (KAYAKO), and
son (TOSHIO), holding his black CAT.
KAYAKO'S FACE has been torn out of every one.
Peter notices something underneath the pile of photos -- a
familiar JOURNAL. The same one Karen found in the closet.
He opens it."
508,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        88.,508,Peter backs away in horror --
509,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        88.,509,"Peter backs into the hallway, breathing hard.
Then a familiar sound reaches our ears:   THUD.   THUD.   THUD.
It's coming from Toshio's room. And it's the same rhythmic
THUDDING we've heard coming from this room before.
Peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads
quickly down the hall (with Karen following him):"
510,PETER,510,"Toshio!   We have to --
He stops short at the door, as he sees --
-- TAKEO, Toshio's father. Eyes rolled back in his head,
tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips.
He's dead -- he's hanging from the ceiling by BLACK HAIR that
seems to cover its entire surface. Kayako's hair.
TOSHIO, now back to his ""dead"" appearance, playfully swings
the body. Takeo's feet THUD rhythmically against the wall."
511,KAREN,511,"Oh my God...
Peter doesn't stay to see any more.   He runs."
512,KAREN,512,"Peter tears down the stairs and runs for the front door,
passing a mirror --
-- he freezes. He saw SOMETHING in the reflection as he
passed. Something wrong.
He takes a step back and looks --
-- it's not his reflection in the mirror.   It's KAYAKO.
Peter stares at the image in disbelief. Then he notices
TOSHIO standing next to Kayako, looking up at her."
513,Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     89A.,513,That came from upstairs.
514,KAREN,514,DOUG!   NO!!!
