0,LLOYD,0,"Excuse me, can you tell me how to
get to the medical school? I'm
supposed to be giving a lecture in
twenty minutes and my driver's a bit
lost."
1,YOUNG WOMAN,1,"Go straight aheads and makes a left
over za bridge."
2,LLOYD,2,"I couldn't help noticing the accent.
You from Jersey?"
3,YOUNG WOMAN,3,Austria.
4,LLOYD,4,Austria? You're kidding.
5,LLOYD,5,"Well, g'day, mate. What do you say
we get together later and throw a
few shrimp on the barbie."
6,LLOYD (CONT'D),6,"Guess I won't be going Down Under
tonight..."
7,"DISPATCHER
(v.o.)",7,"Carr 22, come in, car 22..."
8,LLOYD,8,This is 22.
9,DISPATCHER,9,"22, where the hell are you, Lloyd?
You're running late on the East Side
pick-up."
10,LLOYD,10,"Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my
way."
11,"DISPATCHER
(v.o.)",11,"Well hurry it up. And make sure you
park legally. One more ticket and
your ass is history."
12,HARRY,12,"Okay, gang, single file. You know
the rules: No pushing, no humping,
and no sniffing heinies..."
13,PALMER,13,"Hey, why aren't those mutts on
leashes?"
14,HARRY,14,"The same reason you're not on a leash,
sir because it's demeaning and it
chafes like hell."
15,PALMER,15,"Just get them in here now! They all
have to be bathed and clipped in an
hour."
16,HARRY,16,You kids stay right here...
17,"HARRY (CONT'D)
(at truck)",17,"Hey, wait a minute!"
18,MARY,18,Hello.
19,(beat),19,I'll be just a minute...
20,LLOYD,20,"Why you going to the airport? Flying
somewhere?"
21,"MARY
(dead-pan)",21,How'd you guess?
22,LLOYD,22,"Well, I saw your luggage, then when
I noticed the airline ticket, I put
two and two together."
23,(beat),23,So where you heading?
24,MARY,24,Aspen.
25,LLOYD,25,"Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear
California's beautiful this time of
year."
26,LLOYD (CONT'D),26,Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.
27,MARY,27,I'm Mary.
28,LLOYD,28,"Uh, this isn't my real job, you know.
It's only temporary."
29,MARY,29,Oh?
30,LLOYD,30,"Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I
are saving up our money so we can
open our own pet store."
31,MARY,31,That's nice.
32,"LLOYD
(smiling)",32,I got worms.
33,MARY,33,I beg your pardon?
34,LLOYD,34,"That's what we're gonna call it: I
Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in
selling worm farms you know, like
ant farms. A lot of people don't
realize that worms make much better
pets than ants. They're quiet,
affectionate, they don't bite, and
they're super with the kids."
35,MARY,35,"Aren't ants quiet, too?"
36,LLOYD,36,"Uh... well, sure but they aren't half
as affectionate. And if you cut an
ant's head off, it won't grow back."
37,MARY,37,I see.
38,LLOYD,38,"And best of all, worm farming is a
seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year
industry. I wouldn't mind having a
piece of that pie, if you know what
I mean."
39,LLOYD (CONT'D),39,"What's the matter? Little tense about
the flight?"
40,"MARY
(beat)",40,Something like that.
41,LLOYD,41,"It's really nothing to worry about,
Mary. Statistically, they say you're
more likely to get killed on the way
to the airport. You know, like in a
head-on crash, or something."
42,MARY,42,"Um, Lloyd, could please keep your
eyes on the road."
43,LLOYD,43,"Good thinking. There's a lot of bad
rivers out there."
44,MARY,44,Here you go.
45,LLOYD,45,Keep it. It was my pleasure.
46,LLOYD (CONT'D),46,"Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and
pass out. You'll be there before you
know it."
47,MARY,47,Thanks Lloyd.
48,(beat),48,And good luck with your worms.
49,POLICE OFFICER,49,"Come on, move it, you're in a red
zone."
50,ARMANI SUIT,50,"She's gonna leave the briefcase at
the foot of the escalator. You make
the pick-up."
51,PLAID SPORTCOAT,51,Piece of cake.
52,"LLOYD
(to car's driver)",52,"Drive around me, you pinhead!"
53,LLOYD,53,Damn!
54,LLOYD,54,You can't do this! I'll lose my job!
55,MENTAL,55,"Who the hell do you figure this guy's
working for?"
56,SHAY,56,"I don't know, but we'd better find
out..."
57,SHAY (CONT'D),57,Your ulcer?
58,MENTAL,58,It ain't gonna kill me.
59,HARRY,59,I got fired again.
60,LLOYD,60,"I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but
let's face it, you are one pathetic
loser. No offense."
61,HARRY,61,"None taken. Were you shitcanned,
too?"
62,LLOYD,62,Of course not.
63,(beat),63,I quit.
64,HARRY,64,Why'd you quit?
65,LLOYD,65,"I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire
me."
66,HARRY,66,"Why didn't you wait and see if your
suspicions were well-founded?"
67,LLOYD,67,"Winners control their own destiny,
Har."
68,HARRY,68,"You know, the thing that really chaps
my ass is that I just spent my life
savings turning my van into a poodle."
69,(beat),69,The alarm alone cost me two hundred.
70,LLOYD,70,"Big deal. That car's an old bomb
anyway."
71,HARRY,71,"What are you talking about? It's
only six years old."
72,LLOYD,72,That's forty-two in dog years.
73,HARRY,73,What's with the briefcase?
74,LLOYD,74,It's a love memento.
75,HARRY,75,Huh?
76,LLOYD,76,"The most beautiful woman alive. Her
name was Mary. I drove her to the
airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran
high, breasts heaved. She left this
case in the terminal and flew to
Aspen and out of my life. End of
story."
77,HARRY,77,What's in it?
78,LLOYD,78,"DO you really expect me to go snooping
around in someone else's private
property?"
79,HARRY,79,Why not?
80,"LLOYD
(beat)",80,It's locked.
81,"LLOYD (CONT'D)
(WHISPERING to Harry)",81,Friend or foe?
82,"HARRY
(WHISPERING)",82,We don't have any friends.
83,HARRY (CONT'D),83,"Can't recognize them. Could be student
loan thugs again, or the IRS, or
maybe somebody pissed off about that
case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced
a check on."
84,LLOYD,84,"Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little
swindlers gave me Peanut Butter
Praline."
85,HARRY,85,"Well, whoever they are, they look
serious. One of them's even wearing
plaid."
86,"LLOYD
(cringing)",86,"That's a hostile pattern. I say we
bail and get down to unemployment."
87,GRABNER,87,"Gentlemen, I'm delighted to say that
neither I nor the unemployment
epartment of the state of Rhose Island
can do anything for you."
88,(beat),88,"You've run out of chances. You're
unemployable. Remember last year?
Middle of winter I busted my butt to"
89,LLOYD,89,"Blew it? For your information, we
only missed three days in two months."
90,HARRY,90,"Yeah, and that was because of a
blizzard"
91,"GRABNER
(exploding)",91,YOU WERE SNOW PLOW OPERATORS!
92,HARRY,92,"Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find
something else for us. How about
another crack at that Suicide Hotline?"
93,GRABNER,93,OUT!!!!!
94,MENTAL,94,"The briefcase ain't here. He must've
taken it with him."
95,J.P. SHAY,95,Shit.
96,(beat),96,Well he's gotta come home sometime.
97,MENTAL,97,"Maybe we should leave him a little
message to let 'em know we're playing
hardball."
98,"MENTAL (CONT'D)
(a la Tweety Bird)",98,I taut I taw a puddy cat.
99,"MENTAL (CONT'D)
(still Tweety)",99,"I did, I did..."
100,LLOYD,100,"Give me what's left of our dough.
I'll go to the corner and buy a few
necessities."
101,LLOYD (CONT'D),101,"What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night
Train?"
102,HARRY,102,Get Robitussin it's a better buzz.
103,LLOYD,103,"Excuse me, little old lady, do you
have change for a dollar?"
104,ELDERLY WOMAN,104,"Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't..."
105,LLOYD,105,"Well could you do me a favor and
guard this while I go break a dollar?
My wallet's locked in this machine."
106,ELDERLY LADY,106,"Of course, young man..."
107,HARRY,107,Where's the booze?
108,LLOYD,108,"It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma
Walton. She got my wallet, too."
109,LLOYD (CONT'D),109,"Come on, man, cheer up. We've been
own before. I'm sure we'll land on
our heads somewhere."
110,HARRY,110,"It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet
Petey he's... he's dead."
111,LLOYD,111,"Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What
happened?"
112,HARRY,112,His head fell off.
113,LLOYD,113,His head fell off?
114,HARRY,114,"Yeah, he was pretty old."
115,"LLOYD
(hopeful)",115,I don't suppose he had a warranty...?
116,HARRY,116,"Nah, I bought him used."
117,LLOYD,117,"That's it! I've had it with this
ump! We don't have food, we don't
have jobs, our pets' heads are falling
off, we're surrounded by roving gangs
of larcenous old"
118,HARRY,118,"Okay, calm down."
119,LLOYD,119,No I won't calm down.
120,LLOYD (CONT'D),120,"What the hell are we doing here
anyway, Harry? We've got to get out
of this town."
121,HARRY,121,"Yeah, and go where?"
122,LLOYD,122,"I'll tell you where: someplace warm,
a place where the beer flows like
wine, where beautiful women
instinctively flock like the salmon
of Capistrano."
123,(dramatic PAUSE),123,I'm talking about Aspen.
124,HARRY,124,Aspen?
125,LLOYD,125,"That's right, Aspen."
126,HARRY,126,"I don't know, Lloyd, the French are
assholes."
127,LLOYD,127,"Let me ask you something: do you
want to end up like Petey dead in
some flea-ridden apartment, face-
down on a Dear Abby column, with a
soggy sunflower seed pressed against
your beak? Or do you want to enjoy
your life?"
128,(beat),128,"Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's
eath be in vain. Don't you see what
he was saying? Spread your wings,
man. he was saying? Spread your wings,
man. Fly."
129,"HARRY
(confused)",129,"What are you talking about, Lloyd?
His head fell off."
130,(dawning realization),130,"Wait a second, I know what you're up
to. You just wanna go to Aspen so
you can find that girl who lost her
briefcase and you need me to drive
you there."
131,LLOYD,131,That's bullshit. I'll drive.
132,(beat),132,"And what's so wrong about going
someplace where we know someone who
can plug us into the social pipeline?"
133,"HARRY
(torn)",133,"I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should
stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep
saving money for the worm store. I'm
getting a little sick and tired of
always running from creditors."
134,LLOYD,134,"You know what I'm sick and tired of,
Harry? I'm sick and tired of having
to eek my way through life. I'm sick
and tired of being a nobody."
135,"LLOYD (CONT'D)
(beat)",135,"But most of all, I'm sick and tired
of having nobody."
136,HARRY,136,"Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss."
137,LLOYD,137,"On the other hand, maybe you're right,
Harry. Maybe we should stay here and
try our luck in bankruptcy court.
With all those lawsuits against us,
I'm sure we'll win at least one. It
could be a boost to our egos."
138,HARRY,138,"Petey, I made a promise to you once,
man..."
139,HARRY,139,"...and I'll be damned if I can remember
what it was."
140,LLOYD & HARRY,140,"""We've got to get out of this place,
If it's the last thing we ever do,
We've got to get out of this place,
Girl, there's a better life, for me
and you..."""
141,LLOYD,141,"Well, we're finally doing it. Do you
realize that in all the years we've
known each other, this is the first
time we've done this together."
142,HARRY,142,Been run out of town?
143,LLOYD,143,Taken a trip.
144,LLOYD (CONT'D),144,Why'd you do that?
145,HARRY,145,What?
146,LLOYD,146,Take your seatbelt off.
147,HARRY,147,"Because we just cleared the danger
zone."
148,LLOYD,148,Huh?
149,HARRY,149,"Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety
percent of all accidents happen within
five miles of home. We've already
traveled 6.3 miles."
150,LLOYD,150,"Well what about the people who live
around here? What if we got into an
accident with one of them?"
151,HARRY,151,Where'd you get those?
152,LLOYD,152,Bought 'em when we filled up.
153,HARRY,153,"Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer
on all expenditures. We're on a tight
budget, remember?"
154,LLOYD,154,"This didn't come out of our travel
fund. I was able to scrape up twenty-
five bucks before we left. You know,
so we could live in style."
155,HARRY,155,"Where'd you get twenty-five extra
bucks?"
156,LLOYD,156,I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C.
157,HARRY,157,You mean the blind kid?
158,LLOYD,158,That's right.
159,HARRY,159,"What did you sell him, Lloyd?"
160,LLOYD,160,Just some odds and ends.
161,HARRY,161,Specifically?
162,LLOYD,162,"Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of
marbles, Petey, three comic books a
second, are you telling me you sold
my dead bird to a blind kid? Well
who else was I gonna sell it to?"
163,HARRY,163,"But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a
head."
164,LLOYD,164,"Put your mind at ease, friend. I
took care of it."
165,BILLY,165,Fly!
166,MENTAL,166,"Those bastards. They're rubbing it
right in our faces."
167,J.P. SHAY,167,"Shit! Andre will have a goddamn
aneurysm if we don't get that
briefcase back."
168,MENTAL,168,"Don't   worry, we'll get it back. And
I'll   tell you something else. They
ain't   gonna reach Aspen, either.
I'll   make sure of that."
169,BILLY,169,"Come on, boy, fly!"
170,BILLY (CONT'D),170,"Excuse me, mister. Is there something
wrong with my bird?"
171,MENTAL,171,"Don't worry, Ironside, he just flew
south for the winter."
172,HARRY,172,How far have we gone?
173,LLOYD,173,"According to this map, about an inch
and a half."
174,HARRY,174,"Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map
or we'll never get there. We don't
have enough gas money."
175,LLOYD,175,Relax. We have more than enough.
176,HARRY,176,"I believe you're wrong, Lloyd."
177,LLOYD,177,"And I believe I'm right, Harry."
178,HARRY,178,"I still say wrong, Lloyd."
179,LLOYD,179,How much you wanna bet?
180,HARRY,180,I don't bet.
181,LLOYD,181,What do you mean you don't bet?
182,HARRY,182,"I mean I don't gamble, you know that.
Never have and never will."
183,LLOYD,183,"Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal
that I can get you gambling before
the day's out."
184,HARRY,184,"There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do
it."
185,LLOYD,185,"I'll give you three-to-one odds.
That's three feedbags if you win,
against only one if you lose."
186,HARRY,186,"You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I
already told you, I don't gamble."
187,LLOYD,187,"Okay, five-to-one I can get you
gambling before the day's out."
188,HARRY,188,"Sorry, pal, no way."
189,LLOYD,189,Make it ten-to-one.
190,HARRY,190,"You got yourself a bet, sucker!"
191,LLOYD (CONT'D),191,What's the soup du jour?
192,WAITRESS,192,It's the soup-of-the-day.
193,LLOYD,193,Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl.
194,WAITRESS,194,"Anything else before I leave the
area?"
195,HARRY,195,"Actually, this chocolate milk isn't
mixed very well. Could you please
bring me a spoon?"
196,WAITRESS,196,There. Now you don't need one.
197,LLOYD,197,Uh-oh...
198,HARRY,198,What's the matter?
199,LLOYD,199,"You spilled the salt. That's bad
luck. We're driving across the country
and the last thing we need is bad
luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt
over your right shoulder."
200,HARRY,200,What for?
201,LLOYD,201,Because that's good luck.
202,"MALE VOICE
(o.s.)",202,What the fuck?!
203,LLOYD,203,Or was it the left shoulder?
204,TRUCKER,204,"Who's the dead man threw shit in my
eye?"
205,HARRY,205,"It was a terrible accident, Sir.
Believe me, I would never do anything
to offend a man of your size. Please
accept my most sincere apology."
206,BURLY FRIEND #1,206,"Teach him a lesson, Sea Bass!"
207,SEA BASS,207,You gonna eat that?
208,HARRY,208,Um... the thought had crossed my mind.
209,SEA BASS,209,Still want it?
210,HARRY,210,"Nah, you go ahead."
211,HARRY,211,"Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I
still haven't eaten."
212,LLOYD,212,"Well if you'd stop picking fights
with the locals..."
213,(brightening),213,"Wait a second. I think I just had an
idea. Follow me..."
214,LLOYD (CONT'D),214,"Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like
to apologize for that unpleasant
scene a little earlier."
215,SEA BASS,215,Huh?
216,LLOYD,216,"What I'm trying to say is, my friend
and I would like to buy you guys a
round of beers, just to bury the
hatchet."
217,SEA BASS,217,Make it four boiler-makers.
218,LLOYD,218,"Whatever you want, sir. I'll have
the waitress send them over. Oh, and
fellas hope to see you again down
the road."
219,HARRY,219,"Lloyd, what are you doing? You know
we can't afford to buy them drinks."
220,LLOYD,220,"Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered
to pick up our check. They said just
add this to their tab."
221,"CASHIER
(skeptical)",221,Sea Bass said that?
222,LLOYD,222,"Well, if that guy at the table over
there is Sea Bass..."
223,CASHIER,223,"Okey-dokey, if that's what he wants..."
224,HARRY,224,"Oh, and put these on there, too."
225,CASHIER,225,You got it.
226,"LLOYD
(to Cashier)",226,"By the way, how far is it to Rhode
Island from here?"
227,SEA BASS,227,I'm gonna kill those sons-of-bitches!
228,CASHIER,228,"Hurry and you'll catch 'em. They was
on their way to Rhode Island."
229,LLOYD,229,"I just wish we could've seen Sea
Bass's face when he got the bill."
230,HARRY,230,I hope we never have to.
231,LLOYD,231,"Don't worry. That fish-head is
probably half-way to Providence by
now."
232,HARRY,232,I hope so.
233,LLOYD,233,"Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a
whiz."
234,HARRY,234,"Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now.
What if they figure out we went the
other way. They'll be on us in no
time."
235,LLOYD,235,"But I gotta go. What am I supposed
to do?"
236,HARRY,236,Hold it.
237,LLOYD,237,I can't hold it. I'm about to explode.
238,HARRY,238,"Well... just take a whiz in an empty
beer bottle. There's a couple on the
floor in the back seat."
239,LLOYD,239,Are you serious?
240,HARRY,240,"Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping
now. We could get killed."
241,LLOYD,241,Uh-oh...
242,HARRY,242,What's the matter?
243,LLOYD,243,"The bottle's almost full and I'm
still going."
244,HARRY,244,Well stop going.
245,LLOYD,245,"I can't stop once I already started,
you know that. Quick, get me another
bottle."
246,LLOYD (CONT'D),246,"Jesus, be careful! You almost went
off the road."
247,HARRY,247,"I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best
I can."
248,LLOYD,248,"Here, hold this."
249,HARRY,249,"What are you, a goddamn camel?"
250,LLOYD,250,"Hey, I haven't gone all day."
251,"STATE TROOPER
(o.s.)",251,Pull over!
252,HARRY,252,Huh?
253,STATE TROOPER,253,PULL OVER!
254,"HARRY
(calling out)",254,"No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for
noticing!"
255,HARRY (CONT'D),255,"Jesus, what is this, the fashion
police?"
256,STATE TROOPER,256,PULL YOUR CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE
257,STATE TROOPER,257,"License and registration, please."
258,STATE TROOPER (CONT'D),258,"You know, you fellas were all over
the road back there."
259,HARRY,259,"Yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty
in the car."
260,STATE TROOPER,260,Uh-huh.
261,(beat),261,"Have you boys been doing a little
rinking maybe?"
262,HARRY,262,"No, sir."
263,STATE TROOPER,263,Then what's that?
264,HARRY,264,"Oh, that's nothing, sir."
265,STATE TROOPER,265,"Do you know it's against the law to
rive with an open alcohol container
in this state?"
266,LLOYD,266,"But, your honor, he's telling the
truth. It's not beer."
267,STATE TROOPER,267,Is that right?
268,HARRY,268,"Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep
your mouth shut if you knew what was
good for you."
269,STATE TROOPER,269,Get the hell out of here.
270,LLOYD,270,Nothing. Nothing at all.
271,"MARY
(o.s.)",271,"Lloyd, will you wash my nipples...?"
272,"HARRY
(v.o.)",272,"I don't know, Lloyd, I feel a little
sleazy staying here when we're not
even engaged."
273,"LLOYD
(v.o.)",273,"Hey, it's the only motel that charges
by the hour. We can't afford anything
else."
274,LLOYD,274,"Yep, this sure is the life. Cold
beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink
sheets... You know, there's only one
thing that could make this moment
any better."
275,HARRY,275,What's that?
276,LLOYD,276,If you had a nice set of knockers.
277,HARRY,277,"That's two things, Lloyd."
278,LLOYD,278,Right now I'd settle for one.
279,HARRY,279,"I don't know, Lloyd, these places
just don't do it for me. Brings back
too many memories."
280,LLOYD,280,"What happened, Harry? Some little
filly break your heart?"
281,HARRY,281,"Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher.
We stayed at a place like this once
No-Tell Motel out on Route 31."
282,LLOYD,282,"Felcher? You mean the babe who worked
for the tractor company?"
283,HARRY,283,"The same. We had this incredibly
romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd
be together forever."
284,(SIGHS),284,"Then about a week later, right out
of the blue, she sends me a John
Deere letter."
285,LLOYD,285,"That's cold, Har. Give you any reason?"
286,HARRY,286,"I called her up and she gave me some
crap about me not listening to her
enough or something like that. I
wasn't really paying attention."
287,HARRY (CONT'D),287,"Thing that really hurts is I think
she was seeing another guy. Never id
find out who."
288,"MENTAL
(into phone)",288,"The boys are holed-up in a little
love nest for the night. I think
they're a couple of fucking weirdos."
289,ANDRE,289,"What in hell are those guys up to?
Is it possible that they're Feds?"
290,MENTAL,290,Unlikely from what I've seen.
291,ANDRE,291,"I don't like this one goddamn bit,
Mental. You and Shay were supposed
to grab that bag so we could end
this shit. Now I don't know what the
hell's going on."
292,MENTAL,292,"Hold on a second, Mr. Andre..."
293,MENTAL (CONT'D),293,"Sorry, boss. You were saying...?"
294,ANDRE,294,"Look, Mental, just find out what
they're up to. I want to know who
these guys are."
295,MENTAL,295,Don't worry. I'm on it.
296,SHAY,296,What the fuck...?
297,MENTAL,297,Where's the goddamn dog?
298,MARY,298,"It just doesn't make any sense. I
left the money exactly where they
instructed me to."
299,HELEN,299,"Actually, it makes a great deal of
sense, Mary. We should have called
in the authorities the moment we
knew Melvin had been kidnapped."
300,KARL,300,"Now, Helen, we've been through this
already for Christ's sake, Karl,
these bastards will extort us into
bankruptcy if we let them."
301,MARY,301,"But I'd never forgive myself if
something happened to Melvin."
302,KARL,302,"Stop upsetting my daughter, Helen.
She's been through quite enough
already."
303,MARY,303,"It's not her fault, Daddy. We're all
a little on edge."
304,ANDRE,304,"Has there been any word, Mr. Swanson?"
305,KARL,305,"Nothing yet, Nicholas."
306,ANDRE,306,"Perhaps I should call off the
Preservation benefit this weekend."
307,HELEN,307,"No, Nicholas, it's imperative that
we carry on as usual."
308,KARL,308,"Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll do
everything they ask. Nothing's going
to happen to Melvin, I promise you."
309,MARY,309,"Thank you, Daddy."
310,"MENTAL
(to Shay)",310,"Lie down on the front seat. After
they pick me up I want you to follow
us."
311,LLOYD,311,You're it.
312,HARRY,312,You're it.
313,LLOYD,313,You're it. Quitsies.
314,"HARRY
(tapping him back)",314,"Anti-quitsies. You're it. Quitsies.
No anti-quitsies. No startsies."
315,LLOYD,315,"Damn, you're good, Harry."
316,(beat),316,"Hey, didn't I tell you this trip
would be a blast?"
317,LLOYD,317,"See, I told you these country folks
were friendly, Harry."
318,SHAY,318,What happened?
319,MENTAL,319,"These fuckers are really pissing me
off now."
320,HARRY,320,"Refresh my memory on something, Lloyd:
what exactly do we do when we get to
Aspen?"
321,LLOYD,321,"Well the first thing we do is take a
good deep breath of that famous
Aspenese air."
322,HARRY,322,"Fresh, huh?"
323,LLOYD,323,"The freshest. They say on any day of
the week you can smell a moose-fart
ten miles away."
324,"HARRY
(sincere)",324,Wow... talk about paradise.
325,(beat),325,"And after we're finished breathing,
what next, Lloyd?"
326,LLOYD,326,"Then we make a splash on the social
scene."
327,LLOYD (CONT'D),327,"Harry, look the golden arches. Pull
over, I'm starving."
328,MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE,328,"...That's two cheese burgers, two fries,
and two medium Cokes. Five seventy-
two."
329,HARRY,329,Thanks.
330,MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE,330,Hey!
331,HARRY,331,"About this social scene how do you
expect a couple mutts like us to
make a splash in the land of pedigrees
when we don't even have any money?"
332,LLOYD,332,"Look, once we drop the briefcase off
to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll
plug us right into the party circuit.
After that, we do a little of the
ski"
333,HARRY,333,Where'd you hear that?
334,LLOYD,334,Some bum down at unemployment.
335,HARRY,335,"I don't know, Lloyd."
336,LLOYD,336,What's the matter?
337,HARRY,337,"Money does terrible things to people.
I mean, we could lose our friendship."
338,LLOYD,338,Yeah? So?
339,LLOYD (CONT'D),339,"Hey, wait a second. Hold everything."
340,HARRY,340,What?
341,LLOYD,341,Aren't you forgetting something?
342,LLOYD (CONT'D),342,"Back at Mickey D's? A little matter
you might've overlooked...?"
343,HARRY,343,What?
344,LLOYD,344,My change.
345,HARRY,345,"I think this guy's in trouble. Why
on't you pull over."
346,MENTAL,346,"You guys going as far as Des Moines?
My car died and I'm late for a
business meeting."
347,HARRY,347,It's a fruit.
348,LLOYD,348,It's a vegetable.
349,HARRY,349,"I'm telling you, it's a fruit."
350,LLOYD,350,And I happen to know it's a vegetable.
351,HARRY,351,"Tell you what, why don't we leet an
impartial judge decide."
352,LLOYD,352,Fine with me.
353,HARRY,353,"Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet:
Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables?"
354,LLOYD,354,"Okay, Harry, my turn. Let 'er rip."
355,LLOYD (CONT'D),355,"Hmmm... full-bodied, delicate bouquet,
aged to perfection will rip no fart
before it's time."
356,(beat),356,"Come on, Marquis of Dingleberry's
rules: you got ten seconds. All right.
I'll say: cheese doodles, chili dog
extra onions, garden salad with blue..."
357,HARRY,357,And...?
358,LLOYD,358,Kit-Kat bar.
359,HARRY,359,"You're the best, man."
360,(beat),360,"Okay, my turn."
361,LLOYD,361,"Where are your manners, Harry? We
have a guest."
362,HARRY,362,"Come on, Mr. Mentalino. Let one fly.
It's only a buck."
363,HARRY,363,I'll do one if you will.
364,LLOYD,364,"Okay, you go first."
365,HARRY,365,"No, you go first."
366,LLOYD,366,"No, you go first."
367,MENTAL,367,"Why don't you both stop being a couple
of pussies and go at the same time.
It ain't that hot."
368,LLOYD,368,"Hmmm, not bad..."
369,HARRY,369,"Yeah, more tingly than hot."
370,MENTAL,370,Have some water. It'll help.
371,MENTAL (CONT'D),371,"Aw, shucks, that's right. Water just
makes it worse..."
372,MENTAL,372,"It's Mental. I'm just sitting down
to a nice meal with our boys."
373,ANDRE,373,"Good work. What did you find out so
far?"
374,MENTAL,374,"Nothing yet, but I'm gonna shake 'em
own for information at lunch."
375,(beat),375,Then I'm gonna kill 'em for dessert.
376,ANDRE,376,"Well eat fast, time's running out."
377,MENTAL,377,"Relax, they ain't gonna be running
around anywhere after I dump a little
cyanide in their pops."
378,HARRY,378,"That really wasn't very polite of
him, was it? Maybe we should loosen
the screws of his chair."
379,LLOYD,379,"Harry Dunne, I'm surprised at you.
Perhaps it's about time you brushed"
380,"HARRY
(humbled)",380,You mean like 'turn the other cheek?'
381,LLOYD,381,"No, I mean like 'an eye for an eye.'
Hand me those peppers the atomic
ones."
382,"HARRY
(whispering)",382,Here he comes.
383,MENTAL,383,"Feeling any better, boys?"
384,MENTAL (CONT'D),384,"So tell me, why you fellas headed to
Aspen? Vacation?"
385,LLOYD,385,More like re-location.
386,MENTAL,386,"Doesn't look like you packed much.
All I saw was a couple bags... and
that briefcase."
387,HARRY,387,"The briefcase isn't even ours. Some
lady just left it at the airport.
We're bringing it back to her."
388,MENTAL,388,You mean you don't even know her?
389,LLOYD,389,Not really. I was just her limo river.
390,MENTAL,390,"Talk about being in the wrong place
at the wrong time..."
391,HARRY,391,"Hey, you okay, man? It was just a
goof."
392,"MENTAL
(STRAINED WHISPER)",392,My ulcer... quick... pills... in my coat...
393,MENTAL (CONT'D),393,You son-of-a-bitch!
394,HARRY,394,I can't believe it...
395,LLOYD,395,"Life is a fragile thing, Har. One
minute you're chewing on a burger;
the next minute you're dead meat."
396,HARRY,396,"But he blamed me. You heard him.
Those were his last words."
397,LLOYD,397,"If you don't count that gurgling
sound."
398,LLOYD (CONT'D),398,"Hey, relax, man, I'm just as
responsible as you are we both
slipped him the peppers and look at
me, I on't feel guilty at all."
399,HARRY,399,"Small comfort coming from a man who
sells dead birds to blind kids."
400,(SIGHS),400,"Don't you get it, Lloyd. I've got a
ead guy pissed at me. His restless
spirit will probably haunt me for
the next seventy-five years."
401,LLOYD,401,"That's ridiculous. You probably won't
live to see forty."
402,HARRY,402,Oh yeah.
403,(beat),403,Wow. What a relief.
404,DOCTOR,404,"...My official conclusion is that the
eceased expired from oxygen eprivation
caused by the presence of cyanide in
the bloodstream."
405,DT. DALE,405,You mean he was poisoned?
406,DOCTOR,406,"Unquestionably. We found these by
the body."
407,COP,407,"Waitress says he was with a couple
of younger guys. They're the ones
who called the ambulance then they
hit the road."
408,DT. DALE,408,Any idea where they were going?
409,COP,409,"A witness at the next table thought
he heard them say they were driving
to France."
410,COP (CONT'D),410,"We got a report they were seen heading
west on I-80 toward Colorado."
411,DT. DALE,411,Get a make on the vehicle?
412,COP,412,"Yes, sir. They were driving an '84
poodle."
413,DT. DALE,413,An '84 what?
414,"COP
(straight-faced)",414,"Well it might have been a wire-haired
terrier, Detective. They're very
similar in appearance."
415,HARRY,415,"Let's get off and crash at a motel
before I crash into one."
416,(yawning),416,I need a crib fast.
417,LLOYD,417,"Sorry, Har. We're gonna have to hold
out. Seems we misjudged our expense
allocation. If we pay for a motel we
won't have enough for gas."
418,HARRY,418,What happened to the dough?
419,LLOYD,419,We over-leveraged.
420,HARRY,420,On what?
421,LLOYD,421,"I sprung for Mr. Chili Pepper's last
meal. Felt it was the least we could
o after we deep-sixed him."
422,HARRY,422,"Wait a second one burger put us
over budget?"
423,LLOYD,423,"The slob ordered a double-bacon eluxe
and a chocolate malt."
424,HARRY,424,Oh.
425,(beat),425,So what are we gonna do?
426,LLOYD,426,"Drive. We've only got ten more hours.
We can take turns."
427,SHAY,427,"You heard me, he's dead. The bastards
killed him."
428,ANDRE,428,Jesus Christ...
429,ANDRE (CONT'D),429,"All right, I want you back here now.
If they're coming this way I'm going
to need you."
430,"SHAY
(v.o.)",430,"How's our bankroll doing? Giving you
a hard time?"
431,ANDRE,431,"Melvin's not the problem. It's these
two other guys that have me worried.
I wish I knew what the hell they"
432,ANDRE,432,"How you doing today, Melvin?"
433,HARRY,433,"Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump."
434,HARRY,434,"Skis, huh?"
435,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,435,That's right.
436,HARRY,436,Great.
437,HARRY (CONT'D),437,They yours?
438,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,438,Uh-huh..
439,HARRY,439,Both of 'em?
440,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,440,"Um, yeah."
441,"HARRY
(impressed)",441,Cool.
442,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,442,"Excuse me, you're spraying everywhere."
443,SEA BASS,443,"Well, well, well, if it ain't my old
friend."
444,(checks watch),444,And right on time...
445,"HARRY
(re: suitcases in",445,"That's a lot of luggage for a little
vacation."
446,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,446,"Actually, I'm moving to Aspen. I've
got to get away from my boyfriend."
447,"HARRY
(holding out mirror)",447,"Here, this is a little loose."
448,HARRY (CONT'D),448,Allow me...
449,HARRY (CONT'D),449,"Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen
we can meet up... you know, for hot
chocolate or something."
450,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,450,"Why not? You seem pretty harmless.
I'll give you my number. Just let me
find a pen."
451,ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D),451,I know I have one here somewhere...
452,"HARRY
(urgently)",452,"Look, why don't you just tell it to
me, I've got a good memory."
453,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,453,Are you sure you won't forget?
454,"HARRY
(desperate)",454,Positive please hurry.
455,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,455,Is something wrong?
456,ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D),456,"Okay, my number is 652-2553."
457,(beat),457,"Oh, wait a second, that's my old
number. It's so funny how your mind
god sakes, give me the damn number!"
458,ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D),458,"Look, man, if you're gonna get pushy
you can just forget it!"
459,SEA BASS,459,"First I'm gonna rape you, then I'm
gonna kill you. Any last request?"
460,LLOYD,460,"Um, yeah could you do it the other
way around?"
461,HARRY,461,"You've got some serious explaining
to o, young man."
462,LLOYD,462,"Look, Harry, I told you what happened,
now drop it."
463,HARRY,463,"Sure thing, Lloyd. I promise not to
mention another word about you being
in a bathroom stall with a six-foot,
five-inch trucker with his pants
own."
464,LLOYD,464,"That's a low blow, man."
465,HARRY,465,Not at that height it's not.
466,LLOYD,466,"Listen, bud, if you're trying to
imply that I'm that thought look,
we're almost in Colorado."
467,HARRY,467,"I think it's about   time we pull over
and change seats.   I've been driving
for nine straight   hours I  don't
have the energy to   start a new state."
468,DT. DALE,468,Any sign of them yet?
469,COP,469,"No, but we're expecting them shortly.
A motorist said he spotted a pooch
about thirty miles back headed this
way."
470,LLOYD,470,"Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky..."
471,LLOYD (CONT'D),471,"Boy, some guys just weren't cut out
for life on the road."
472,LLOYD,472,"Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back."
473,"HARRY
(groggy)",473,How long have I been out?
474,LLOYD,474,"I'd say a good five hours, anyway."
475,HARRY,475,"Great. We must be getting real close,
huh?"
476,LLOYD,476,"Should be. I've been averaging about
ninety miles an hour all night."
477,HARRY,477,Good man.
478,LLOYD,478,"Boy, I'll tell you, this is one
angerous highway. You wouldn't believe
all the road pizza two dead ogs, a
couple of rabbits, a snake and some
big thing I couldn't even recognize."
479,HARRY,479,"That's awful. Did you see them get
hit or were they already lying there?"
480,LLOYD,480,I hit 'em.
481,HARRY,481,"Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains
to be a little rockier than this."
482,LLOYD,482,"I was thinking the same thing. That
John Denver's some full of shit,
huh?"
483,LLOYD (CONT'D),483,"I must say, Des Moines sure is a
pretty little town."
484,HARRY,484,"Yeah, it really is."
485,(beat),485,"Wait a minute when did you visit
Des Moines?"
486,LLOYD,486,Last night. We drove through it.
487,HARRY,487,"What are you talking about? You were
snoring like a baby when we went
through Des Moines."
488,"LLOYD
(sing-song)",488,"Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Rise and
shine."
489,(LAUGHS),489,"You were the one who was asleep,"
490,HARRY,490,"Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't
the sun rise in the east and set in
the west?"
491,LLOYD,491,"In our country it does, yes."
492,HARRY,492,"Then perchance you can explain to me
why the sun is in our face at 7:30
in the morning when we're heading
west."
493,LLOYD,493,"I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can
make a mistake."
494,LLOYD (CONT'D),494,"Come on, man, pull yourself together."
495,HARRY,495,"You know, I got half a mind to just
jump on the bus to Europe and say
goodbye to your ugly mug forever."
496,"LLOYD
(rolls his eyes)",496,"You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo."
497,HARRY,497,Oh yeah? Why not?
498,LLOYD,498,You don't have a passport.
499,LLOYD (CONT'D),499,"Come on, stop being a baby about
this. Okay, so we back-tracked a
tad."
500,HARRY,500,"A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a
sixth of the way across the country
in the wrong direction. Now we don't
have enough money to get to Aspen,
we on't have enough money to get
home, we don't have enough to eat,
we don't have enough to sleep!"
501,LLOYD,501,"Well it doesn't do any good having
you sitting there on your butt whining
about it. If we're gonna get out of
this hole, we're gonna have to dig
ourselves out."
502,HARRY,502,"You know, you're absolutely right,
Lloyd."
503,LLOYD,503,Where you going?
504,HARRY,504,Home. I'm walking home.
505,LLOYD,505,You can't be serious.
506,"HARRY
(sarcastic)",506,"Why not? We're probably only five
miles away."
507,"LLOYD
(CALLING OUT)",507,"Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you
never screwed up."
508,HARRY,508,"Look, man... I'm sorry."
509,(beat),509,"I never should have let you talk me
into this in the first place. You've
got a good reason to goo a beautiful
girl's waiting for you. But let's
face it, Lloyd, there's nothing
waiting for me in Aspen."
510,(beat),510,"There's nothing waiting for me
anywhere."
511,LLOYD,511,"Got room for one more, if you still
want to go to Aspen."
512,HARRY,512,Where'd you find this baby?
513,LLOYD,513,"Used car dealer. I   traded the van
for it. Plus I got   the guy to throw
in fifty bucks for   gas money."
514,(beat),514,"Come on, man, what   do you say? We
still partners?"
515,DT. DALE,515,"It doesn't make sense. They should've
been here hours ago."
516,COP,516,Maybe they're smarter than we thought.
517,DT. DALE,517,"How smart can they be? They're riving
a goddamn dog!"
518,COP #2,518,"We just got a report that they were
spotted about two hours ago heading
east near Des Moines on I-80."
519,"DT. DALE
(incredulous)",519,"Des Moines?! Why that's five hundred
miles from here!"
520,COP #1,520,"Guess they got wind of our welcoming
party."
521,DT. DALE,521,We're wasting time. Let's mobilize.
522,LLOYD,522,"Tell me something, Harry. Would you
really have kept going home if I"
523,HARRY,523,"Well let me put it this way, Lloyd:
Do you remember when we were Cub
Scouts and we got lost in the woods
uring that blizzard? We huddled
together all night, and we made an
oath that if we ever got out of there
alive we'd never ever leave each
other's side again. Do you remember
that?"
524,LLOYD,524,We were never Cub Scouts.
525,HARRY,525,Exactly.
526,HARRY (CONT'D),526,"What the hell is this? There's a
coffin in the back!"
527,LLOYD,527,"Relax, it's empty."
528,HARRY,528,"I don't give a shit. I'm not driving
anywhere with a casket. You know I'm
superstitious calm down. We'll dump
it off first chance we get."
529,WOMAN,529,I married a cheapskate.
530,MAN,530,"Shut your trap, Gerdie."
531,WOMAN,531,"I'm so embarrassed. I'll never be
able to show my face again."
532,MAN,532,"I knew something good would come out
of this."
533,WOMAN,533,"We could have given him a more
ignified burial."
534,MAN,534,"Your uncle was a cheap man. Remember
what he got us for our twenty-fifth?
A friggin' fern. There's no way I'm
gonna spend a load to get him planted."
535,WOMAN,535,You son-of-a-bitch! I want a ivorce!
536,LLOYD,536,"Isn't this wonderful? What more could
a couple of single guys like us ask
for?"
537,HARRY,537,How about food and shelter?
538,LLOYD,538,You're so materialistic.
539,(beat),539,"Why don't we get down to business
and eliver the briefcase to Mary.
Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in
for tea and a strumpet or two?"
540,HARRY,540,"Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes
the lovely young lady reside?"
541,LLOYD,541,Um... good question.
542,HARRY,542,"Well what's her last name? We'll
look it up in the phone book."
543,LLOYD,543,"Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I
caught that either."
544,HARRY,544,"What about the briefcase, Lloyd?
There must've been a name on it,
right?"
545,"LLOYD
(brightening)",545,"Come to think of it, there is. It's
engraved right into the leather."
546,HARRY,546,What is it?
547,LLOYD,547,"Samsonite   spelled just like it
sounds."
548,HARRY,548,Any soup left?
549,LLOYD,549,A little. Shall we share it?
550,HARRY,550,Please.
551,LLOYD,551,Mmmm mmmm good...
552,HARRY,552,"Hey, you got something stuck in your
front teeth."
553,LLOYD,553,"Hmmm... looks like an old piece of
Beef Jerky."
554,HARRY,554,Wanna split it?
555,LLOYD,555,You're pathetic. Get your own.
556,HARRY,556,"I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd."
557,LLOYD,557,Roll up your window.
558,HARRY,558,It is rolled up.
559,LLOYD,559,"Then I guess the damn anti-cold system
isn't working. You really should get
it fixed if we're gonna live here
all winter."
560,HARRY,560,What anti-cold system?
561,LLOYD,561,"Right here the A/C button. I put it
on full blast about an hour ago and,
if anything, the car's getting colder."
562,LLOYD (CONT'D),562,What are you going out there for?
563,HARRY,563,To warm up.
564,LLOYD,564,What are you worrying about now?
565,HARRY,565,"I'm worried about how you're gonna
survive the pummeling I'm about to
give you."
566,LLOYD,566,Huh?
567,LLOYD (CONT'D),567,"Harry, calm down! You're acting like
a wild animal!"
568,HARRY,568,"Get over here and take your medicine,
Lloyd!"
569,LLOYD,569,"Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine.
I'm a Christian Scientist!"
570,LLOYD (CONT'D),570,What are you doing?
571,HARRY,571,"Something I should've done a long
time ago. This stupid thing has been
the root of our problems all along."
572,LLOYD,572,"Don't do anything foolish, Harry."
573,HARRY,573,"Foolish? This is the most sensible
thing I've done in years. I'm gonna
toss this goddamn curse right into
that river."
574,LLOYD,574,"You're making a big mistake, Harry!
I'll never forgive you for this!"
575,LLOYD (CONT'D),575,"Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get
better, I promise! In fact, I think"
576,HARRY,576,You're bluffing.
577,LLOYD,577,"No I'm not, man look."
578,HARRY,578,"That's a filling, you liar!"
579,HARRY (CONT'D),579,"I used to have a life! A miserable
one, but a life, nonetheless!"
580,"LLOYD
(CHOKED VOICE)",580,"Harry, look!"
581,LLOYD,581,"Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a
few bucks just a small loan from
the briefcase, and we check into a
cheap motel."
582,HARRY,582,Sounds good.
583,LLOYD,583,"And we'll keep track of the money we
spend with IOUs."
584,HARRY,584,"We'll be meticulous    right down to
the last penny."
585,LLOYD,585,"That way, whatever we borrow we can
pay back."
586,HARRY,586,Absolutely. We're good for it.
587,LLOYD,587,"You know, as soon as we get jobs."
588,HARRY,588,"It'll come right out of our first
paycheck."
589,BARNARD,589,"...This is the Hotel Danbury's
Presidential Suite, gentlemen. It's
normally reserved for royalty,
visiting dignitaries, and illustrious
stars of stage and take it."
590,BARNARD (CONT'D),590,"Very good, sir. Are there any bags
you'd like sent up?"
591,LLOYD,591,"Thanks, Barnard, but we'll find our
own chicks."
592,"BARNARD
(peevish)",592,I wasn't talking about ladies.
593,HARRY,593,"Oh. Then go ahead and send thim up.
What are their names?"
594,BARNARD,594,"Sir, I meant your luggage."
595,LLOYD,595,"Tell you what you can send up, my
friend how about some chow?"
596,BARNARD,596,I'll bring you a menu.
597,LLOYD,597,"Don't bother. Just order us one of
everything."
598,HARRY,598,One of everything? Lloyd...
599,LLOYD,599,"Oh, sorry."
600,(beat),600,Make that two of everything.
601,LLOYD (CONT'D),601,"And here you go, Barney. You keep us
happy, we'll keep you happy."
602,BARNARD,602,"Yes, sir!"
603,LLOYD,603,Our first IOU. Signed and dated.
604,HELEN,604,Mary? You awake?
605,HELEN,605,"I brought you some tea. I thought it
might help you relax."
606,MARY,606,Thank you.
607,MARY (CONT'D),607,"Yech! What's in this, whiskey?"
608,HELEN,608,"Uh, sorry... that one's mine."
609,HELEN (CONT'D),609,"Feeling any better, honey?"
610,MARY,610,"Just knowing that Melvin's out there,
being held by God knows who..."
611,MARY,611,"It's all my fault. I should've been
there."
612,HELEN,612,"Bullshit. You can't blame yourself
for this. If you'd been there they
would've taken you, too."
613,MARY,613,"Maybe we should just pay them the
money again and get this thing over"
614,HELEN,614,"Now Mary, everything that can be
done is being done. You've got to
stop torturing yourself."
615,MARY,615,"What am I supposed to do? Go about
my life as if everything were fine?"
616,HELEN,616,"That's exactly what you should do.
Get the hell out more, go skiing,
socialize. Don't you see, honey? We
can't let on that anything is wrong.
If the press or authorities get wind
of this, the kidnappers might panic."
617,(beat),617,"Who knows what they'd do to poor
Melvin then?"
618,HARRY,618,"Oh god, it's really true. Last night
I thought I might've been dreaming."
619,LLOYD,619,"It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked
the big time."
620,HARRY,620,"And it was so simple. All it took
was somebody else's money."
621,HARRY (CONT'D),621,"You know, Lloyd, I think you might've
gone a little overboard with the
spending today."
622,LLOYD,622,"What's the big deal? We're gonna pay
it all back anyway, right?"
623,HARRY,623,"Sure, but do you really think you
needed to buy those two surfboards?"
624,LLOYD,624,"Surfboards? I thought those were
beginner's skis."
625,HARRY,625,"Ahhh. I was wondering why you had
those bindings put on them."
626,LLOYD,626,Where'd this come from?
627,HARRY,627,I bought it.
628,LLOYD,628,What for?
629,HARRY,629,"I like the feel of it against my
skin..."
630,(defensive),630,"...I mean, you know, when a woman's
wearing it."
631,LLOYD,631,"Harry, how many women do you know
who wear a size XXL?"
632,HARRY,632,"Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now.
I'm supposed to have a few
eccentricities."
633,LLOYD,633,"Enter, parlez vous!"
634,BARNARD,634,"I brought you your newspaper and
some champagne, gentlemen.
Unfortunately, we didn't seem to
have the, um, label you requested."
635,LLOYD,635,"All out of Boone's Farm, huh?"
636,BARNARD,636,"You have a rapier wit, sir. I took
the liberty of bringing a comparable
substitute: Dom Perignon."
637,LLOYD,637,"Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?"
638,BARNARD,638,"Thank you so much, sir."
639,LLOYD,639,"Oh, one more thing: You can     dispense
with the 'sir' crap. Let's     face it,
Barney, we're all from the     same mold."
640,(winks),640,"We just have a little more     dough
than you right now."
641,HARRY,641,Cocktail hour has commenced!
642,HARRY (CONT'D),642,"Hey, later on what do you say we...?"
643,HARRY (CONT'D),643,Lloyd... you okay?
644,"LLOYD
(dumbstruck)",644,"Harry, it's her."
645,HARRY,645,Who?
646,LLOYD,646,"Mary with the briefcase. This is
her..."
647,LLOYD (CONT'D),647,Mary Swanson...
648,HARRY,648,"Come on, Cinderella, it's time to
get you ready for the ball..."
649,LLOYD,649,"Thanks for the lift, Barney."
650,ANDRE,650,"Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a
five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner."
651,LLOYD,651,This should cover a couple plates.
652,HARRY,652,"I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if
we want seconds?"
653,LLOYD,653,"Put us down for four plates, my good
man."
654,"J.P. SHAY
(WHISPERING)",654,"Jesus Christ, boss... it's them."
655,LLOYD,655,"I'm getting nervous, Harry."
656,HARRY,656,"relax, Lloyd. These people are just
like you and me."
657,LLOYD,657,"What are you talking about? They're
educated, well-bred, charming, and
sophisticated."
658,HARRY,658,"So what? We can be sophistica holy
shit, would you look at the fun bags
on that hose hound."
659,LLOYD,659,"Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm
already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't
like me?"
660,HARRY,660,"Look, let's just go saddle up to the
bar and down a couple bowls of
loudmouth soup. A little booze'll
bring back that old Lloyd Christmas
over-confidence."
661,"LLOYD
(to BARTENDER)",661,"Two martinis, straight up."
662,LLOYD (CONT'D),662,"Shut up, Harry."
663,HARRY,663,I didn't say anything.
664,LLOYD,664,"Yeah, well I know what you were gonna
say and I'm telling you to shut up
in advance."
665,HARRY,665,"How do you know what I was gonna
say?"
666,LLOYD,666,I read you like a book.
667,HARRY,667,"Okay, if you read me like a book
then what was I gonna say?"
668,LLOYD,668,You were gonna say:
669,(in Harry's looped,669,"'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't
mind roasting my weenie in.'"
670,LLOYD (CONT'D),670,"And I would say 'shut up', because
this is our chance to get in with
the rich and powerful and you don't
ingratiate yourself to the kind of
people by acting like Ron Jeremy on
Spanish Fly."
671,ANDRE,671,"If I could have your attention,
please..."
672,ANDRE (CONT'D),672,"I'd like to thank you all for coming
to this very special event. As you"
673,MR. SWANSON,673,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the
Icelandic Snow Owl."
674,MR. SWANSON (CONT'D),674,These magnificent specimens were
675,MR. SWANSON,675,"Here these lovely birds will be
allowed to breed in a natural but
protected habitat. And, God willing,
with your help and that of the
Society's, we will see these wonderful
creatures flourish once more."
676,MR. SWANSON (CONT'D),676,"Again, thank you, and enjoy your
evening. Oh, and feel free to take a
closer look at our new friends here.
Enjoy."
677,LLOYD,677,"Two more, please."
678,HARRY,678,"Lloyd, I've never seen you this
uptight. You've gotta chill out."
679,LLOYD,679,"I can't help it. This is a very
important night for me."
680,"LLOYD (CONT'D)
(beat)",680,"Harry, have you ever wondered why
you and I never have long-term
girlfriends?"
681,HARRY,681,"What are you talking about? I went
out with Fraida Felcher for two and
a half weeks."
682,LLOYD,682,That was a fluke.
683,(beat),683,"The reason we never have long-term
girlfriends is because of one thing:
We're afraid of the C word."
684,HARRY,684,That's crazy. We live for the C word.
685,LLOYD,685,I'm talking bout commitment.
686,"HARRY
(beat)",686,Oh.
687,LLOYD,687,"Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry.
The first time I laid eyes on Mary
Swanson, I knew she was the one."
688,(beat),688,"Some things you feel in your heart,
other things you feel in your groin.
This girl makes me feel it all in
the heart."
689,LLOYD (CONT'D),689,"Oh shit, there she is."
690,"HARRY
(checking her out)",690,"Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd.
She's an angel."
691,(beat),691,"Well, what are you waiting for? Get
over there and talk to her."
692,LLOYD,692,"She's gonna think I'm some kind of
psycho when she realizes how far I
came just to see her."
693,HARRY,693,"You have her briefcase she's gonna
be thrilled to see you."
694,LLOYD,694,"And then what? She'll take it back
and that'll be it. I'm a nobody."
695,HARRY,695,"Look, man, you just drove two thousand
miles to see this girl. Don't quit
on the last fifty feet."
696,"LLOYD
(brightening)",696,"Wait a second, I have an idea. You
go over and introduce yourself. That
way you can build me up so when I
come along I won't have to brag about
myself. Tell her I'm good-looking
and I'm rich and I have a rapist's
wit."
697,HARRY,697,"I can't tell her you're good looking,
Lloyd she's got eyes."
698,LLOYD,698,"Please Harry, I'm appealing to you
as one loser to another. Just build
me up and then give me a signal to
come over. Please."
699,HARRY,699,"All right. But you're gonna owe me a
big one for this."
700,HARRY (CONT'D),700,Nice set of hooters you got there.
701,MARY,701,I beg your pardon?
702,HARRY,702,The owls. They're beautiful.
703,MARY,703,Oh. Yeah.
704,(beat),704,Are you a bird lover?
705,HARRY,705,"Well, I used to have a parakeet, but
my main area of expertise is canines
that's dogs to the layperson."
706,MARY,706,"Thanks. I love dogs, too. So how"
707,HARRY,707,"Oh, I've trained them, bathed them,
clipped them; I've even bred them."
708,MARY,708,Really? Any unusual breeding?
709,HARRY,709,"Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But
one time we successfully mated a
Bulldog and a Shitzu."
710,MARY,710,Really? That's weird.
711,HARRY,711,Yeah. We called it a Bullshit.
712,(breaks out LAUGHING),712,Just a little breeder joke.
713,HARRY (CONT'D),713,"Anyway, the real reason I came over
is because I want to introduce you
to a friend of mine."
714,HELEN,714,"Mary, I don't believe I've met your
friend."
715,MARY,715,"Actually, we haven't been introduced
yet."
716,MARY,716,"I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my
stepmother, Helen."
717,HARRY,717,"Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you
both."
718,HELEN,718,"I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne.
I was hoping we'd get a chance to
meet."
719,"HARRY
(taken aback)",719,You were?
720,HELEN,720,"That tuxedo I love a man with a
sense of humor. So does Mary."
721,HARRY,721,Really?
722,HARRY (CONT'D),722,"Anyway, about my friend you doing
anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because
I believe Mary's looking for somebody
to hit the slopes with. Whuh?"
723,MARY,723,"Helen, you're embarrassing me."
724,HELEN,724,"Well you are, aren't you?"
725,(to Harry),725,"Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So
what do you say, Harry? Are you
available?"
726,HARRY,726,"Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend
your friends for one day. You and
Mary will have a ball."
727,HARRY (CONT'D),727,"Um... well... I don't know. You see, the
thing is... sure."
728,LLOYD,728,How come you didn't call me over?
729,HARRY,729,"Relax, you're golden. I got you a
ate with her tomorrow."
730,LLOYD,730,Wha... you... I... it's...
731,(smiles),731,"I love you, man. I love you!"
732,HARRY,732,"Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making
a scene."
733,LLOYD,733,This calls for a toast!
734,LLOYD (CONT'D),734,"You're gonna be my best man, Har, I
mean it. It was always between you
and my future wife's brother, but
you just earned a seat at the head
table, pal."
735,"HARRY
(under breath)",735,"I think we've done enough hobnobbing,
Lloyd."
736,J.P. SHAY,736,Maybe it was just a coincidence.
737,ANDRE,737,"Don't be stupid. It's a message,
plain and simple: We killed their
bird, now they killed ours."
738,J.P. SHAY,738,"But how could anybody off a bird
with a cork?"
739,ANDRE,739,"These guys arent' just anybody.
They're good. Look what they did to
Mental. He was the best, and yet he
fell right into their web."
740,J.P. SHAY,740,"But the bastards already got our
money. What the hell more could they
want?"
741,"ANDRE
(at wit's end)",741,"I don't know, god damn it!"
742,LLOYD,742,"Mrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs.
Mary Christmas. You"
743,HARRY,743,"Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you
think you may be jumping the gun a
little? I mean, who knows, when you
get to know her, you may find out
she's not your type."
744,LLOYD,744,"Impossible. I know my type    when I
see it. Now let me get this    straight,
she wants me to meet her at    the
Avalanche Bar and Grill on    Main
Street?"
745,HARRY,745,"That's what she said. Ten o'clock
sharp."
746,LLOYD,746,"Time out. Where are going ressed
like that."
747,HARRY,747,"I, uh, thought while you were making
your love connection I'd try my luck
on the slopes."
748,LLOYD,748,"You mean you're gonna go out in public
dressed in tights?"
749,HARRY,749,"These aren't tights. They're
fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers."
750,LLOYD,750,"But you can see the outline of your
who-who."
751,HARRY,751,Really?
752,LLOYD,752,Turn sideways.
753,LLOYD (CONT'D),753,"Actually, it's just a tiny little
lump. No one will ever notice."
754,HARRY,754,"You're right. I can't go out dressed
like this."
755,HARRY,755,"Sorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving
a clutch with these things."
756,"HARRY
(CALLING OUT)",756,"You take the first run alone. I'm
gonna loosen up down here."
757,WAITER,757,"I'm sorry, we don't open until eleven."
758,LLOYD,758,"I'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait
at the bar?"
759,MARY,759,"Beautiful day, huh, Harry?"
760,HARRY,760,Glorious.
761,MARY,761,"God, it feels so good to get up here.
I haven't been outdoors much in the
last couple of weeks."
762,HARRY,762,Why not?
763,"MARY
(evasive)",763,"There's been... family problems. I
on't want to bore you with them."
764,HARRY,764,Thanks.
765,HARRY (CONT'D),765,"Oh, look... frost."
766,MARY,766,Are you okay?
767,"HARRY
(lisping)",767,Sure. I do this all the time...
768,"HARRY
(lisping)",768,See ya at the bottom...
769,"HARRY
(lisping)",769,Hi.
770,(off their looks),770,"Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to
have a cup of warm water, would you?"
771,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,771,Hi.
772,ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D),772,"Bad day, huh?"
773,"ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
(big smile)",773,"well don't worry, Mercury's supposed
to be coming out or retrograde
tonight. Things will get better."
774,MARY,774,"My god. Harry, are you okay?"
775,"HARRY
(lisping)",775,"I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off."
776,SHAY,776,"You're luck just ran out, pal."
777,MARY,777,This is silly. Let me help you...
778,MIME,778,GODDAMN IT! WHAT THE FUCK?!
779,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,779,"...Anyway, after my boyfriend backed
into my garage for the third time, I
said to myself, 'Run, Cathy, run for
your life before he kills you both'.
Then you know what the klutz does
and to be perfectly honest, I on't
really care."
780,(beat),780,"Look, I'm sorry, but I'm not very
good company today. I'll say."
781,(beat),781,"I have an idea. Why don't you tell
me a little about yourself."
782,LLOYD,782,Maybe some other time.
783,LLOYD (CONT'D),783,"Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to
know a Mary Swanson, would you?"
784,BARTENDER,784,"Sure. Her family comes in here all
the time."
785,LLOYD,785,Do you know where she lives?
786,BARTENDER,786,"Yeah, they got that big place up on
Alpine Drive."
787,MARY,787,"I've got to tell you, today was really
just what I needed. Thanks a lot,
Harry."
788,HARRY,788,"My pleasure, Mary."
789,MARY,789,So you'll pick me up tonight at 7:45?
790,HARRY,790,"Better make it quarter to eight.
I've got a few things to take care
of first."
791,"HARRY (CONT'D)
(to himself)",791,"Mary Dunne... Mrs. Mary Dunne... Got a
nice ring to it."
792,LLOYD,792,Some best man.
793,HARRY,793,"It doesn't make any sense, Lloyd.
She told me ten o'clock sharp. Are
you sure you went to the right bar?"
794,LLOYD,794,"Believe me, it was the right place."
795,(SIGHS),795,"I don't know, Har, maybe she just
had second thoughts."
796,HARRY,796,"I have a hard time believing that,
Lloyd. The girl said she couldn't
wait to see you again."
797,HARRY (CONT'D),797,Wait a minute...
798,LLOYD,798,What?
799,HARRY,799,"It just occurred to me. She must've
meant ten o'clock at night."
800,"LLOYD
(brightening)",800,Do ya think...?
801,HARRY,801,"Of course! Why would she have you
meet her at a bar at ten in the
morning?"
802,"LLOYD
(shrugging)",802,"I just figured she was a raging
alcoholic."
803,HARRY,803,"Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties?"
804,LLOYD,804,"I knew there was an explanation. And
here I thought she was standing me
up."
805,HARRY,805,"That'll teach you to jump to
conclusions."
806,(beat),806,"Anyway, since you have your night
all"
807,LLOYD,807,"Will you join me in a good luck toast
before you head out?"
808,"HARRY
(o.s.)",808,"Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think
will help your chances."
809,LLOYD,809,"Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't
you?"
810,HARRY,810,"Uh... it's for mature audiences. I
on't wanna chance getting turned
away at the door."
811,LLOYD,811,I see.
812,LLOYD (CONT'D),812,To my friend Harry the matchmaker.
813,HARRY,813,Mmmmm...
814,MARY,814,Hi. Come on in.
815,MARY,815,"Make yourself at home. I'm almost
ready. Just give me one more minute."
816,"MARY
(o.s.)",816,"Are you in there, Harry?"
817,"HARRY
(nervously)",817,Be right out.
818,"MARY
(o.s.)",818,"I hope you're not using the toilet.
It's broken."
819,HARRY,819,Huh?
820,"MARY
(o.s.)",820,It doesn't flush.
821,HARRY,821,"Um, no, I was just... shaving."
822,MARY,822,Shaving?
823,"HARRY
(o.s.)",823,"Yeah! I was running a little late.
Thought this would save time."
824,MARY,824,"Okay. Well I'll be in the living
room whenever you're ready."
825,"HARRY
(under breath)",825,"Come on, flush, you bastard..."
826,REPORTER,826,"We'll be back in a minute with the
story of the blind Indiana boy who
was duped into buying a dead parakeet."
827,BLIND BOY,827,...I thought he was real quiet...
828,MARY,828,Yes...?
829,LLOYD,829,Hi.
830,(beat),830,Don't you remember me?
831,MARY,831,Um... I'm not really...
832,LLOYD,832,"South Bend. I drove you to the airport
last week."
833,"MARY
(dawning on her)",833,"Oh my god. Lloyd, right?"
834,LLOYD,834,You remembered.
835,MARY,835,What are you doing in Aspen?
836,LLOYD,836,"I brought you your briefcase You
left it at the airport so I picked
it up for you."
837,MARY,837,You're the one who took my briefcase?
838,LLOYD,838,"Yeah, it's back at my hotel room.
Come on, let's take a ride. I'll
give it to you."
839,MARY,839,Wait right here.
840,MARY (CONT'D),840,"Harry, what are you doing in there?"
841,HARRY,841,"Uh... just cleaning my teeth. Give
me a minute, Mary, I'll be right
with you."
842,"MARY
(o.s.)",842,"Sorry, but something important's
come up and I have to run out. It's
sort of an emergency. I'll explain
later."
843,HARRY,843,But Mary --
844,"MARY
(o.s.)",844,"--I'm really sorry, Harry. I promise
we'll do this another time."
845,HARRY,845,Great...
846,ANDRE,846,They're mine...
847,LLOYD,847,"..So anyway, as soon as I got to
town I tried to look you up but I
idn't know your last name."
848,MARY,848,"I don't believe it. You really have
it."
849,LLOYD,849,"'Course I have it. When Lloyd
Christmas drives a woman to the
airport, he makes sure she gets all
her luggage, no matter what he has
to"
850,MARY,850,"This is incredible. You mean to say
you drove two thousand miles just
for me?"
851,LLOYD,851,"Well... no... I mean, you know, there
were other reasons..."
852,(beat),852,"Actually, yeah, I guess I did."
853,MARY,853,"That is the sweetest thing I've ever
heard."
854,"HARRY
(MUMBLING to himself)",854,"It's all Kharma, Harry. You screw
your best friend over and it's gonna
come back to haunt you, plain and
simple..."
855,LLOYD,855,"Look, Mary, I know this may seem a
little sudden but I've given it a
lot of thought: You're the woman
I've been waiting for my whole life,
and I'm not ashamed to admit it --"
856,(holds up his hand),856,"--Please, let me finish."
857,(DEEP BREATH),857,"I'm crazy about you. I've never felt
this way about anyone. You make it
so easy for me to tell you my
innermost desires."
858,(NERVOUS LAUGH),858,"Listen to me, I feel like a schoolboy
again."
859,(beat),859,"A schoolboy who desperately wants to
make sweet, sweet love to you."
860,MARY,860,"Oh... I thought I heard you talking
to someone."
861,LLOYD,861,Mary...
862,(BLURTING OUT),862,"I desperately want to make love to a
schoolboy."
863,"MARY
(taken aback)",863,Maybe I should be going now.
864,LLOYD,864,"No, that's not what Imeant. I meant...
I really like you, Mary. I like you
a lot."
865,LLOYD (CONT'D),865,"I'm gonna ask you something flat out
and I want you to answer me honestly:
What do you think the chances are of
a girl like you and a guy like me
ending up together?"
866,MARY,866,"Lloyd, that's difficult to say. I"
867,LLOYD,867,"--I asked you to be honest, Mary."
868,MARY,868,"But Lloyd, I really can't --"
869,LLOYD,869,"--Come    on, give it to me straight. I
rove a    long way to see you, the least
you can    do is level with me. What
are my    chances?"
870,MARY,870,Not good.
871,LLOYD,871,"You mean not good, like one out of a
hundred?"
872,MARY,872,"I'd say more like one out of a
million."
873,"LLOYD
(Duh)",873,So you're telling me there's a chance?
874,MARY,874,Nicholas... what are you doing here?
875,ANDRE,875,"I've been looking for you, Mary."
876,LLOYD,876,Husband?
877,ANDRE,877,"Aren't you two going to invite me
in?"
878,WOMAN'S VOICE,878,Hey!
879,HARRY,879,You...? What are you doing here?
880,ANDRE,880,"Well at least you two got to say
your goodbyes."
881,LLOYD,881,Who are you?
882,ANDRE,882,"Don't play dumb with me, asshole.
I'm the rightful ower of that
briefcase you've been carrying."
883,LLOYD,883,Uh-oh.
884,MARY,884,"Nicholas, you... you motherfucker!
My family trusted you!"
885,ANDRE,885,Shut up!
886,LLOYD,886,"Uh, sir, about the briefcase, I want
you to know, my friend Harry and I
have every intention of reimbursing
you."
887,ANDRE,887,Open that damn thing!
888,ANDRE (CONT'D),888,"What the hell's this? Where's all
the money?"
889,LLOYD,889,"That's as good as money, sir. Those
are our IOUs. You can add them up
yourself. Every penny's accounted
for."
890,ANDRE,890,You're fucking dead!
891,LLOYD,891,"Now don't do anything hasty, man."
892,HARRY,892,"Lloyd, are you home? We've gotta
talk, man. I have a serious confession
to make."
893,HARRY (CONT'D),893,"Oh good, you found her. I'll just
leave you two kids alone."
894,ANDRE,894,Why don't you stay and join the party?
895,ANDRE,895,"..I want a one-way ticket to Rio De
Janerio departing as soon as
possible..."
896,MARY,896,You mean you two know each other?
897,"LLOYD
(cutting)",897,"Yeah, we used to be best friends."
898,HARRY,898,Until he turned into a backstabber.
899,LLOYD,899,"Me a backstabber? You got a lot of
nerve. I saw her first."
900,HARRY,900,"Hey, I couldn't help it if she found
me irresistable."
901,LLOYD,901,"But you knew how crazy I was about
her."
902,HARRY,902,"Yeah, and you knew how crazy I was
about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't
stop you, did it?"
903,"LLOYD
(waning righteousness)",903,What are you talking about?
904,HARRY,904,"Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me
the whole sordid story."
905,LLOYD,905,"Look... I was gonna tell you about
that. It was gonna be mentioned at
the reading of my will. I swear, you
can ask my lawyer."
906,HARRY,906,"Well I guess we both learned a little
something about each other, didn't
we?"
907,LLOYD,907,"You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as
good friends as we thought we were."
908,HARRY,908,Guess not.
909,LLOYD,909,"I mean, if one beautiful girl   could
rip us apart like this, then   it seems
our friendship isn't worth a   damn."
910,(beat),910,"Maybe we should call it quits   right
here."
911,HARRY,911,"Just tell me where to sign, bud."
912,ANDRE,912,"Okay, which one of you losers wants
to die first?"
913,HARRY,913,"I wouldn't pull that trigger if I
were you."
914,ANDRE,914,"Why not? It'll look like just another
Aspen love triangle. You caught the
two of them in bed, handcuffed them
to the post, murdered them, and killed
yourself."
915,"HARRY
(smug)",915,"Except you're forgetting one minor
etail."
916,ANDRE,916,What's that?
917,HARRY,917,"If you kill us, you'd be killing
yourself."
918,ANDRE,918,Huh?
919,HARRY,919,"You see, philosophers believe that
we're all really just tiny pieces of
one huge universal being. In other
words, I am you and you are me, so
if you were to kill us you'd be
committing suicide, you unenlightened"
920,ANDRE,920,--Shut up!
921,MARY,921,"What about my husband? Did you kill
him, too?"
922,HARRY,922,Husband? What husband?
923,LLOYD,923,"Mary's married, Harry."
924,ANDRE,924,No need to worry about Melvin.
925,(beat),925,"Now this is the last time I'll ask:
Who wants to die first?"
926,HARRY,926,"Kill her. The bitch should've told
him she was married back at the
airport. It would've saved us a lot
of trouble."
927,LLOYD,927,"No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the
one who got you into this mess."
928,HARRY,928,"No, wait, do me first. I'm the one
who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve
it."
929,LLOYD,929,"Jesus Christ! You killed my best
friend, you bastard!"
930,ANDRE,930,"If it's any consolation, you're about
to be reunited."
931,LLOYD,931,Harry! You're alive!
932,COP #1,932,"Get your hands up, asshole!"
933,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,933,"Special Officer Kathryn Frick. Federal
Bureau of Investigation."
934,"LLOYD
(dumbstruck)",934,You gotta be kidding.
935,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,935,"Good work, Harry."
936,HARRY,936,"She grabbed me down in the lobby and
explained what was up. They slapped
this on me and gave me a gun."
937,"LLOYD
(to Athletic Beauty)",937,But how did you...?
938,ATHLETIC   BEAUTY,938,"We've been following   you two all the
way from Providence.   Mr. and Mrs.
Swanson had a homing   device plated
in the briefcase."
939,HARRY,939,"Yeah, about that dough..."
940,ATHLETIC BEAUTY,940,Every bill was counterfeit and marked.
941,LLOYD,941,"She's something, ain't she, Har?"
942,HARRY,942,"You were right, Lloyd. She was
efinitely worth the trip."
943,LLOYD,943,"Guess we have to admit it, she was
too good for us."
944,MELVIN,944,"Oh god, baby, I missed you!"
945,MELVIN (CONT'D),945,"I can't thank you enough, fellas. It
was so darn dank in that well, I
really thought it would be the death
of me."
946,HARRY,946,"Hey, Barney..."
947,BELL CAPTAIN,947,"Yes, gentlemen?"
948,LLOYD,948,"Look, we just wanted to say that we
appreciate all you did for us during
our stay."
949,HARRY,949,"And we're, um, sorry about the money
we gave you turning out to be phony."
950,BELL CAPTAIN,950,"Don't worry about it, gentlemen. The
Swanson family has promised to
reimburse everyone."
951,LLOYD,951,"Well, anyway, thanks again for
everything."
952,BARNARD,952,Where are you two headed?
953,HARRY,953,"I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer
camp somewhere to call home."
954,BARNARD,954,Why not right here?
955,LLOYD,955,"This joint is a little out of our
budget, Barney."
956,"BARNARD
(smiling)",956,"Oh, I think we might be able to find
you a free room somewhere -- after
all, like you once told me, we're
all from the same mold."
957,(winks),957,"You just don't have any dough right
now."
958,HARRY,958,Are you on the level?
959,BARNARD,959,"Absolutely. We'll just slide you
into one of the employee rooms..."
960,BARNARD (CONT'D),960,"...Provided, of course, you don't
mind working one or two afternoons a
week."
961,LLOYD,961,"You know what, Barney, I think we'll
take out chances down the road."
962,"HARRY
(v.o.)",962,"Since we're finished elbow-rubbing,
what next, lloyd?"
963,"LLOYD
(v.o.)",963,"I say we head due south and try a
little nose-rubbing with some of
them slinky eskimo babes."
964,"HARRY
(v.o.)",964,"Now you're talking my language. You
know I got a weakness for blondes."
