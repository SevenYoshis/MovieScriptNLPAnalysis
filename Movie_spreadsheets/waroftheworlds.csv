0,SAL,0,Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa!
1,SAL,1,"I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00
I got half of Korea coming in."
2,RAY,2,"No, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour
blow! Call Tadesko."
3,SAL,3,"Tadesko can't move 40 containers in
an hour. I need somebody who can do
double picks."
4,RAY,4,"I wish I could help you Sal. God damn
union regulations."
5,SAL,5,"(getting angry) Come on, I'm in a position
here!"
6,RAY,6,"Come on, you remember the union regulations,
Sal."
7,SAL,7,"(angrily) You know what your problem
is?"
8,RAY,8,"(joking) I can think of a couple of
women who'd be happy to tell you."
9,RAY,9,Is it 8:30? We say that?
10,MARY ANN,10,We said 8:00.
11,RAY,11,"(changing subject) Hey, this is one
safe looking vehicle you got yourself
here Tim. Congratulations."
12,TIM,12,Thank You.
13,RAY,13,8 o'clock huh?
14,MARY ANN,14,"Um-Huh. We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic."
15,RAY,15,There he is! You got a hug?
16,RAY,16,"(continues) Confusing handshake? (joking)
Kick in the teeth? The door's locked.
(to Mary Ann): Still working on those
manners?"
17,RACHEL,17,Hello dad.
18,RAY,18,"Hello, Rachel!"
19,ROBBIE,19,"(during bickering, at the front door)
The door's locked."
20,MARY ANN,20,"(suit case in hand) I'll just get it
in the door."
21,RACHEL,21,"It's got rollers, just roll it."
22,MARY ANN,22,"Well we can't roll it up the stairs
now can we?"
23,RAY,23,"Really, I got it from here, okay?"
24,RAY,24,"(to Tim) It's a 302 V8. It's gonna be
out of here next week."
25,RAY,25,"(trying to get her to leave) You better
get going if you want to beat the traffic,
don't you think?"
26,MARY ANN,26,"You're out of milk. (smells it) And
everything else."
27,RAY,27,"(mad) Would you close the door please?
Now that that's my refrigerator."
28,TIM,28,"I'm gonna go wait outside. (to Rachel)
I love you sweetheart (hugs her) see
you in a few days."
29,RACHEL,29,Bye Tim.
30,MARY ANN,30,I'd better get this upstairs.
31,RACHEL,31,"(trying to get her bag form Mary Ann)
Mom, Mom!"
32,RAY,32,"Mary Ann, let me get this."
33,MARY ANN,33,I can get it.
34,RAY,34,"(rushes to close his bedroom door, as
if hiding something) Excuse me."
35,MARY ANN,35,"A little old to still be sharing aren't
they?"
36,RAY,36,I don't hear any complaints.
37,MARY ANN,37,"No, I do."
38,MARY ANN,38,"Robbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie
to make sure he's listening) ...on the
French occupation of Algeria due Monday
which he's yet to begin. It would be
nice if he were done by the time we
got back so we don't have to keep him
up all night on Sunday."
39,ROBBIE,39,"I just got to type it up. (makes typing
motion)"
40,MARY ANN,40,"No, you just got to start writing it
first."
41,ROBBIE,41,(interrupts her) I love you mom!
42,MARY ANN,42,"I love you. (begins walking over to
Rachel) Listen to your father."
43,MARY ANN,43,"Oh, no shoes on the bed."
44,MARY ANN,44,"We'll be at my parent's house in Boston
but don't call the house line, because
you know. Well the point is I've got
my cell phone. So if anything comes
up, or if you have any questions just
call."
45,RAY,45,"Believe it or not, I can handle it."
46,MARY ANN,46,I'll leave the phone on.
47,RAY,47,"Mary Ann? (beat) It's a good look for
you."
48,MARY ANN,48,You think?
49,RAY,49,Yeah.
50,MARY ANN,50,Take care of our kids.
51,RAY,51,"Mary Ann, you got nothing to worry about.
Listen, you tell your mother that Ray
sends his love and kisses."
52,MARY ANN,52,(laughs) She'll love that.
53,ROBBIE,53,Baseball season's over.
54,RAY,54,"Five minutes. It's not going to kill
you."
55,RAY,55,"There he is. (Robbie puts on his new
cap) Boston? (hesitating) That's how
it is? (no response from Robbie) That's
how it's gonna be?"
56,RAY,56,Careful with that throw.
57,ROBBIE,57,Whatever Ray!
58,RAY,58,"Your mom says you've got a report due
on Monday, so you are going to work
on that when you're done here."
59,ROBBIE,59,"Yeah, I'm almost finished, I just got
to type it up."
60,RAY,60,"Yeah, bullshit!"
61,ROBBIE,61,"Yeah, and what do you know Ray?"
62,RAY,62,"Everything. Haven't you heard? Between
me and my brother, we know everything."
63,RACHEL,63,What's the capital of Australia?
64,RAY,64,That's one my brother knows.
65,ROBBIE,65,"Is it okay with you if I just laugh
the first 500 times you tell that one."
66,RAY,66,"Just do your report. We don't send you
to school so you can flunk out."
67,ROBBIE,67,"You don't pay for it, Tim does."
68,RAY,68,That's half of what I've got.
69,ROBBIE,69,You're an asshole. I hate coming here.
70,RAY,70,That why you act like such a dick?
71,RAY,71,What?
72,RACHEL,72,"That's not how you're going to get through
to him. You want him to listen to you..."
73,RAY,73,"(interrupts her) What are you? Your
mother or mine?"
74,RACHEL,74,Where are you going?
75,RAY,75,To sleep. I work for a living.
76,RACHEL,76,What are we supposed to eat?
77,RAY,77,"You know, order."
78,RAY,78,What's the matter?
79,RACHEL,79,I got a splinter.
80,RAY,80,Where'd you get it. Come here.
81,RACHEL,81,On your porch railing.
82,RAY,82,"What, you want me to... (beat) You want
me to take that out for you?"
83,RACHEL,83,Absolutely not!
84,RAY,84,"Well, come here let me see it."
85,RAY,85,It's gonna get infected.
86,RACHEL,86,No it wont.
87,RAY,87,"Yes, it's gonna get infected."
88,RACHEL,88,"No, it won't. When it's ready, my body
will just push it out."
89,RAY,89,Push it out?
90,RACHEL,90,"I read that. (as she sits back down)
You should get TiVo. Tim got it for
my room. It's awesome. I can watch all
my shows after homework."
91,RAY,91,"Yeah, I'll just put that on my platinum
card. Robbie? (no response) Robbie?"
92,RAY,92,"(with the disgusting food in his mouth)
What is that?"
93,RACHEL,93,Hummus.
94,RAY,94,Hummus?
95,RACHEL,95,"From the health food place. I kept one
of their menus last time we were here."
96,RACHEL,96,"Uh, you said order!"
97,RAY,97,"(laughs) I meant order food! Where is
Robbie?"
98,RACHEL,98,He went out.
99,RAY,99,Out where?
100,RACHEL,100,"I don't know. He just took your car
and left."
101,FRIEND 1,101,You ever see something like that?
102,RAY,102,"(scratching his chin) In the springtime
maybe. Not this time of year. Come on,
we can see better from the back yard."
103,RAY,103,That is so weird.
104,FRIEND 2,104,What?
105,RAY,105,The wind is blowing toward the storm.
106,FRIEND 2,106,That is weird.
107,RAY,107,"Rachel, wanna see something cool?"
108,RAY,108,It's okay.
109,RACHEL,109,I want to go inside.
110,RAY,110,It's okay.
111,RACHEL,111,I want to go inside.
112,RAY,112,"Okay, you go ahead."
113,FRIEND 2,113,"That's enough weather for me. (begins
walking inside)"
114,RACHEL,114,I don't want to go by myself.
115,RAY,115,"Kind of fun, ain't it?"
116,RACHEL,116,No.
117,RAY,117,"Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of
July."
118,RACHEL,118,No it's not.
119,RAY,119,It's okay. You're fine.
120,RACHEL,120,It hit right behind our house.
121,RAY,121,"Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there
again because lighting doesn't strike
twice in the same place."
122,RAY,122,"Oh, SHIT!"
123,RACHEL,123,Where's Robbie?
124,RAY,124,I don't know.
125,RACHEL,125,"Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you
okay?"
126,RAY,126,Where's the thunder?
127,RACHEL,127,Why won't it stop?
128,RACHEL,128,(with hesitation) Is it over?
129,RACHEL,129,Where are you going?
130,RAY,130,"Just checking things out. Just wait,
wait there."
131,RACHEL,131,Are we going to be okay?
132,RAY,132,I don't know.
133,RACHEL,133,You don't know.
134,RAY,134,"No. I meant... Rachel, please, just
stop asking so many questions. Just
wait here."
135,FRIEND 2,135,You believe this Ray? Every single car.
136,RAY,136,"(worried) Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus."
137,ROBBIE,137,The car just stopped and...
138,RAY,138,"(interrupts him) You're okay? Are you
okay?"
139,ROBBIE,139,"... and the lighting started hitting
about a block away over and over again.
And me and this other guy we..."
140,RAY,140,"(getting angry) Where the hell'd you
go?"
141,ROBBIE,141,"Over on Lincoln Avenue. (break) ...
by the church."
142,RAY,142,"Did you see it? Did you... Were you
near it?"
143,ROBBIE,143,"Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and
over the lighting started hitting. It
opened up this hole or something..."
144,RAY,144,26 times?
145,ROBBIE,145,Yeah.
146,RAY,146,"Okay, well, you're okay?"
147,ROBBIE,147,Yeah.
148,RAY,148,"Good, because your sister is in the
house, I want you to go in that house
and I want you to stay with her. Okay?
(break, as he starts running down the
street) And the next time you take my
car with no driver's license and no
permission, I call the cops. You better
be there when I get back."
149,RAY,149,Robbie. (snaps his hands together)
150,RAY,150,"Manny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it,
dead?"
151,MANNY,151,"All of them, everything, look at this...
(taps the starter motor) starter's fried."
152,RAY,152,Lightning hit it?
153,MANNY,153,"Not even close. I thought if I changed
it... you got any idea what's going
on?"
154,RAY,154,"I'm on my way to find out. Try umm...
try changing the solenoids."
155,MANNY,155,"Right, (to accompanying mechanic) Right
see, I told you that, the solenoids."
156,COP 1,156,Let us through. Let us through here.
157,FRIEND 3,157,"Hey, what up, Ray?"
158,RAY,158,"(joking) I should of known you two were
behind this."
159,FRIEND 3,159,"Hey, god's pissed off at the Neibor
hood"
160,RAY,160,Can you blame him?
161,FRIEND 4,161,You see it?
162,RAY,162,"Yep, you got power where you are?"
163,FRIEND 3,163,"Nope, nothing."
164,RAY,164,It's the cars though. That's the thing.
165,FRIEND 4,165,"Solar Flare, that's what this guy told
me."
166,RAY,166,A solar flare?
167,FRIEND 4,167,"Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma,
they turn into solar flare flashes.
It's the only thing that can kill all
of the electronic stuff."
168,FRIEND 3,168,Can I say something?
169,FRIEND 4,169,What bro?
170,FRIEND 3,170,"The sun does not cause lightning, okay?"
171,FRIEND 4,171,"Bro, I'm just telling you what that
guy said he heard."
172,FRIEND 3,172,"I know but it just sounds dumb saying
that..."
173,COP 1,173,"I never seen anything like this before.
That many strikes of lighting in one
spot."
174,RAY,174,Is this the only place?
175,FRIEND 4,175,Is it hot?
176,RAY,176,No. It's freezing.
177,COP 2,177,What is that?
178,RAY,178,You feel that?
179,FRIEND 3,179,"Yeah, I feel that."
180,FRIEND 4,180,What is it the subway?
181,COP 1,181,There's no subway here.
182,FRIEND 4,182,PATH Train maybe?
183,COP 1,183,That can't be the water main.
184,COP 2,184,There's nothing else down there.
185,COP 1,185,The water main doesn't run through here.
186,COP 2,186,"Well, there's something down there and
it's moving."
187,FRIEND 4,187,Oh my god.
188,FRIEND 4,188,"Ray, no, stay man."
189,ROBBIE,189,What happened?
190,RACHEL,190,What's going on?
191,RACHEL,191,"Dad, what's the matter?"
192,ROBBIE,192,What's all that stuff all over you?
193,ROBBIE,193,"Rachel reaches through a leg of the
island to pull at Ray's hood on his
shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his
head toward Rachel fast enough to make
some of the white powder poof off as
if jerked back into reality. Robbie
jumps as well in fright."
194,RACHEL,194,What's all the stuff?
195,ROBBIE,195,Hello? Ray?
196,RAY,196,We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.
197,ROBBIE,197,"(questioning) What? Wait. I have no
idea what's going on..."
198,RAY,198,"(while Robbie asks) ... all the food
from the refrigerator and the cupboard,
put it in here."
199,ROBBIE,199,"I think we are having a bit of a shock
here...what's going on, just tell me..."
200,RAY,200,Just do it.
201,RAY,201,"Rachel, sweetheart..."
202,RACHEL,202,"Dad, you're really scaring me."
203,RAY,203,I need you to get your suitcase...
204,RACHEL,204,Dad. (break) Dad!
205,RAY,205,"The one that you brought, bring it to
me, okay?"
206,RAY,206,"Can you do that for me, darling?"
207,ROBBIE,207,What's happening?
208,RAY,208,"Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now. We...
We've only got about another minute."
209,RAY,209,"Please, Please, Please."
210,RAY,210,Just keep it down.
211,ROBBIE,211,"Ray, I'm standing right beside you.
Can you please answer me?"
212,RAY,212,Just get in the front seat Robbie.
213,RACHEL,213,Who's car is this?
214,RAY,214,Just get in.
215,RACHEL,215,Who's car is this?
216,MANNY,216,"Hey, Hey, Ray! You were absolutely right.
I had to change the sole... Ray?"
217,MANNY,217,Hey Ray? Ray? What?
218,MANNY,218,Ray. Open up.
219,MANNY,219,"Open the door, come on! OPEN THE DOOR
RAY!"
220,MANNY,220,What are you...
221,RAY,221,(interrupts him) Get in.
222,MANNY,222,"That's funny, you gotta get out of the
car. You can't take it."
223,MANNY,223,"It's not my car. It's not your car.
Where you going? Daddy's acting crazy
kids. Guy's gonna come back..."
224,RAY,224,"(interrupts him) I don't have time to
expl...."
225,MANNY,225,"(interrupts him) You're busting my chops.
I got a shop to run. You know how many
people..."
226,RAY,226,(interrupts him) Get in!
227,MANNY,227,"No, RAY GET OUT OF THE..."
228,RAY,228,GET IN MANNY OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE!
229,RACHEL,229,What do you mean?
230,MANNY,230,"All right, get out of the truck! I'm
not kidding now. GET OUT OF THE CAR
RAY!"
231,MANNY,231,"I'm not fooling around, I got a busy
day ahead of me..."
232,RAY,232,(to Robbie) Close the door! CLOSE IT!
233,MANNY,233,"RAY! BRING THE CAR BACK RAY! IT'S NOT
MY CAR!"
234,RAY,234,GET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN!
235,RACHEL,235,Is this the terrorists?!?!
236,RAY,236,JUST GET DOWN. GET DOWN!
237,RAY,237,GET DOWN!
238,ROBBIE,238,HOLY SHIT!
239,ROBBIE,239,Where are we going?!?!?!
240,RAY,240,"We gotta go! We got to be the only working
car around here. I'm not stopping until
we are clear."
241,ROBBIE,241,CLEAR OF WHAT?!?!
242,RAY,242,We gotta go.
243,ROBBIE,243,WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!?!?!?
244,RAY,244,YOU SAW! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!!
245,ROBBIE,245,BY WHO? WHO IS ATTACKING US?!?!
246,RAY,246,"Rachel... Rachel you've got to keep
it down Rachel!"
247,RAY,247,Rachel! SHUT UP RACHEL! I CAN'T THINK!
248,ROBBIE,248,"(with a vein driven face) YOU ARE FREAKING
HER OUT!!"
249,RAY,249,"WELL, LOOK, I'M DRIVING, DO SOMETHING!!!"
250,ROBBIE,250,"Okay, (slapping his arms together on
top of each other, demonstrating) Put
em' up Rache."
251,ROBBIE,251,"Make the arms. (he grabs her elbows
so she holds the position. He begins
to calm her down) This space right here,
this is yours."
252,ROBBIE,252,"... This belongs to you, right?"
253,RACHEL,253,"(panting, but keeping eye contact) Yes..."
254,ROBBIE,254,"(reassuring her) You're safe in your
space."
255,RACHEL,255,"(keeping eye contact) I'm safe in my
space."
256,ROBBIE,256,"(reassuring her) You're safe in your
space. Nothing is going to happen to
you in your space."
257,RACHEL,257,I'm really scared.
258,ROBBIE,258,"I'm gonna go to the front seat to talk
to dad..."
259,RACHEL,259,No....
260,ROBBIE,260,"(reassuring her) I will be two feet
away. Okay."
261,ROBBIE,261,Will you hold my hand?
262,RACHEL,262,Yes.
263,ROBBIE,263,Are you gonna be okay?
264,RACHEL,264,(relatively calm) Yes.
265,ROBBIE,265,"(taking a breath to calm himself) I
want to know everything you know."
266,RAY,266,"This thing, this machine, it crawled
out of the ground and started torching
everything, just killing everybody."
267,ROBBIE,267,What is it? (break) Is it terrorists?
268,RAY,268,"No, this came from some place else."
269,ROBBIE,269,You mean like Europe?
270,RAY,270,NO ROBBIE!! NOT LIKE EUROPE!!!
271,RAY,271,"That machine, it was already buried."
272,RAY,272,"Maybe it came down in the lightning
storm."
273,ROBBIE,273,"Wait a minute... you just said it was
buried."
274,RAY,274,"No, the machine I'm talking about was
buried. But, what came down in the lighting
storm, what operates it. That's the...
that's the.... You know. The...."
275,RACHEL,275,The what?
276,ROBBIE,276,"Why aren't there any helicopters or
airplanes?"
277,RAY,277,"Hey Rache. How you doing there girl?
(to Robbie) How she doing?"
278,ROBBIE,278,How you doing?
279,RACHEL,279,I'm fine.
280,ROBBIE,280,(to Ray) She's good.
281,RAY,281,"Good.  Hey, what was that thing you
did with her?"
282,ROBBIE,282,Works sometimes. She gets claustrophobic.
283,RAY,283,Hey Rachel
284,RACHEL,284,I want mom.
285,RAY,285,I know. You feel better?
286,RACHEL,286,I want mom.
287,RAY,287,"Yeah, tell me about it, you know?"
288,RACHEL,288,Take me to Mom's!
289,RAY,289,"Listen, I just need you to hold it together
for me, okay?"
290,RACHEL,290,I WANT MOM!!!
291,RAY,291,"When you start screaming like that,
you know, I can't really..."
292,RACHEL,292,TAKE ME TO MOM!!!
293,RAY,293,I know...
294,RACHEL,294,TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!
295,RAY,295,That's where we're going right now.
296,RACHEL,296,TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!
297,RAY,297,I KNOW!!
298,RACHEL,298,"Come on, hurry up Dad..."
299,RACHEL,299,"Robbie, get the door.... (she knocks
on it)"
300,RACHEL,300,"(begins, and continues once in the house)
MOM! TIM!!"
301,ROBBIE,301,"(begins, and continues once in the house)
MOM!! TIM!!"
302,ROBBIE,302,They're gone.
303,RACHEL,303,Is she dead??
304,RAY,304,"She's not dead. All right? She's just
no here. Okay? They're never here."
305,ROBBIE,305,How do you know?
306,RAY,306,Because they are on their way to Boston....
307,RAY,307,"... and so they just kept on going,
they're probably up to your grandma's
house by now."
308,ROBBIE,308,(dialing the phone) I'm gonna call her.
309,RACHEL,309,"How come the lights are on here and
not at your place?"
310,RAY,310,"Umm.... Because nothing bad happened
here. Okay?"
311,RAY,311,"So, were safe here. All Right?"
312,RAY,312,"Okay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay,
you are safe in your area..."
313,RACHEL,313,Dad. That's not how it goes.
314,RAY,314,"Okay, well, you hungry, huh? I'll get
you some food. I'm gonna feed you. Get
something to eat.  (digs into the box)
What do we have here??"
315,ROBBIE,315,".. Busy signals, one of the fast ones....
You think all the circuits are down?"
316,RAY,316,"(continues) Ketchup, Mustard, Ahh, Tabasco,
Barbeque Sauce. This is really good
Robbie. Vinaigrette. I said pack food.
What... What the hell is this?"
317,ROBBIE,317,That's all that was in your kitchen.
318,RAY,318,"Okay. No, it's all right, it's all right."
319,RAY,319,"Uh, food... Uh, bread... (getting the
bread) okay, we're gonna have... umm....
We'll just get some sandwiches."
320,RAY,320,"You ever see me deal? Wanna see me deal?
Okay, there's two for you, two for Robbie,
two for me, (he has one extra in his
hand) ...one for the house. (laughs)"
321,RAY,321,"Maybe after we get done eating, I will
take you down, teach you how to play
some poker. A little five card stud...
a little blackjack..."
322,RACHEL,322,I'm allergic to peanut butter.
323,RAY,323,(laughs) Since when?
324,RACHEL,324,(with a snotty look) Birth!
325,RAY,325,"Okay, well, umm, here (hands her two
pieces of bread) You can eat the bread.
Okay?"
326,RACHEL,326,I'm not hungry.
327,RAY,327,"Okay, well. Robbie and I are going to
be eating peanut butter sandwiches.
(to Robbie) You want jelly on this sandwich?"
328,ROBBIE,328,I'm not hungry either.
329,RAY,329,"You're not hungry either? Well, that's
fine."
330,RAY,330,"Everybody just relax, okay? Because
we are here now and we're safe, and
we're gonna stay.  And in the morning
your mom and Tim are going to be here
and everything's gonna be fine. Okay?
(no responses) Okay."
331,RACHEL,331,"If everything's fine, why do we have
to sleep in the basement. We've got
perfectly good beds."
332,RAY,332,It's like a slumber party.
333,ROBBIE,333,"What are you afraid is gonna happen
to us?"
334,RAY,334,"(walks over to the weight room corner
of the basement) Nice basement."
335,RACHEL,335,"I want to sleep in my bed. I've got
back problems."
336,RAY,336,"Okay. You know on the Weather Channel
when there's a tornado, and they tell
you to go to the basement for safety?
It's like that."
337,RACHEL,337,There's gonna be tornadoes?
338,RAY,338,"Rachel, no more talking."
339,RACHEL,339,Could you be a little nicer to me. God!
340,ROBBIE,340,Wanna stay here?
341,RACHEL,341,"Yeah. Good night, love you."
342,ROBBIE,342,"Love you, Rache."
343,RACHEL,343,Is the lighting back?
344,RAY,344,"No, this is something else..."
345,ROBBIE,345,(screams) AHHHH... WHAT'S THAT SOUND?
346,RAY,346,I NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE!!!
347,RACHEL,347,IS IT THEM!!! IS IT THEM!!!
348,RAY,348,"WE GOTTA GO!! WHERE DO WE GO??? ROBBIE,
THIS IS YOUR HOUSE, WHERE DO WE GO??"
349,RAY,349,WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!!
350,RACHEL,350,Are we still alive?
351,RAY,351,Down here!
352,RAY,352,Were you on this plane? Are you a passenger?
353,MAX (NEWS CAMERA OPERATOR),353,"Hey, how you doing? Wanna help me open
this?"
354,RAY,354,Are you a passenger?
355,NEWS REPORTER,355,"He's deaf. The shell went off right
beside him. The camera on his shoulder
saved his life. (to Max) You hear that
Max? Your stupid camera saved your stupid
life."
356,RAY,356,Where were you?
357,NEWS REPORTER,357,"Out there in the pine barrens. We were
attached to a National Guard unit, the
83rd Mechanized. They moved to one of
those things around midnight. They've
got some kind of shield around them.
We can't see it, but everything we fire
at them detonates too early before we
can get close enough to cause any damage.
When they flash that thing, everything
lights up like Hiroshima."
358,RAY,358,There's more than one?
359,REPORTER,359,You gotta be kidding me right?
360,REPORTER,360,"We were feeding New York but New York
went dark. So we patched over to D.C.,
they went down, L.A., Chicago, uplink
to London. Even called the affiliates
to try and get them to catch the feed,
but nobody answered."
361,REPORTER,361,"It's the same everywhere. Once the tripods
start to move, no more news comes out
of that area."
362,RAY,362,"Oh, my god!"
363,REPORTER,363,You ain't seen nothing yet.
364,RAY,364,"I saw that storm. I was right in the
middle of one of those."
365,REPORTER,365,"No, you didn't see it like this. Those
machines come up from under the ground,
right? That means they must have been
buried there a long time ago. So who's
driving the god damn things? (pointing
to the monitor) Watch the lightning.
Watch it..... Watch the lighting....."
366,RAY,366,What is that?
367,REPORTER,367,"That is them. They come down in capsules,
riding the lighting into the ground
into the machines right?"
368,DRIVER,368,"You hear that? We're getting the hell
out of here."
369,DRIVER,369,Come on! Get in! Get in! Get in!
370,REPORTER,370,Hey. Were you on that plane?
371,REPORTER,371,"Oh, that's too bad, it would have been
a really great story."
372,RAY,372,Look at me. Look at me.
373,RAY,373,"You keep your eyes only on me, you understand?"
374,RAY,374,"Don't look down, don't look around me.
I'm taking you to the car and you're
gonna want to look around. But you are
not going to, are you?"
375,RAY,375,"You're doing good. You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right
to Boston, and we're gonna see your
mom."
376,RACHEL,376,"I'm not gonna look, dad."
377,RAY,377,"That's a girl. That's my girl.  Okay,
listen, I want you to close your eyes.
Got them closed?"
378,RACHEL,378,Um-Huh.
379,RAY,379,There you go. Keep em' closed for me.
380,RAY,380,"Robbie, get in."
381,RAY,381,ROBBIE!! GET IN!!!
382,RACHEL,382,Why are you yelling?
383,RAY,383,"(to Rachel) It's okay. (to Robbie) Get
in!"
384,ROBBIE,384,Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?
385,RAY,385,"Because I don't want everybody to see
we've got a working car. (going over
the plan) We'll stay along the Hudson
until we find an open bridge or ferry,
then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then
take the back roads across Connecticut
all the way to Boston."
386,RACHEL,386,Where is everybody?
387,RAY,387,"I don't know. Running, hiding, hiding
in their basements."
388,ROBBIE,388,"If we had any balls, we'd go back there
and find one of those things and kill
it."
389,RAY,389,"Yeah, well, why don't you just let me
make the big decisions, okay?"
390,ROBBIE,390,"Which would be when? Never Ray? Never's
about your speed."
391,RACHEL,391,"Okay, enough Robbie!"
392,RAY,392,"(angrily) Okay! Enough with the Ray
shit!! It's dad, sir, or if you want
Mr. Ferrier. That sounds a little weird
to me but you decide."
393,RACHEL,393,Dad?!?!
394,RAY,394,"Yes, Rachel."
395,RACHEL,395,I have to go to the bathroom.
396,RAY,396,Really?
397,ROBBIE,397,"Come on. (tugs at his shirt sleeve which
Ray has a hold of) I gotta go!"
398,RAY,398,"Not so fast, not so fast, all right?
Now, there are two things we have to
watch out for, and the second is people
who might want our car."
399,ROBBIE,399,There's nobody around!
400,RACHEL,400,I gotta go.
401,RAY,401,"(displeased) Rachel! Rachel, that's
good right there. (points to a spot
20' away)"
402,RACHEL,402,I'M NOT GOING IN FRONT OF YOU GUYS!
403,RAY,403,"All right, then just go where I can
see you!"
404,RACHEL,404,ARE YOU CRAZY?? DON'T LOOK!!
405,RAY,405,I'm not gonna look! JUST STAY IN SIGHT!!
406,RACHEL,406,THAT'S LOOKING!!
407,RAY,407,"Listen. Every time you don't listen
to me, I'm telling your mother, okay?
I'm making a list. (reinforcing) I'm
making a list!"
408,RAY,408,"I told you to stay where I could see
you!"
409,RACHEL,409,I'm sorry!
410,ROBBIE,410,STOP!! DO YOU HAVE ROOM??? STOP!!!
411,ROBBIE,411,"WAIT, STOP!!! LET ME ON!!! LET ME ON!!!

412,ROBBIE,412,"WAIT!!! STOP!!! GIVE ME A HAND!!! YOU

413,SOLDIER,413,"Watch it, kid! YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSLELF
RUN OVER!!!"
414,RAY,414,"WHAT!?!?!  ROBBIE, YOU WANT TO GO IN
THAT DIRECTION?"
415,RAY,415,"THERE'S NOTHING LIVING IN THAT DIRECTION,
ROBBIE!!!"
416,ROBBIE,416,"WHAT DO YOU CARE?!?!? YOU NEVER GAVE
A SHIT BEFORE!!! YOU NEVER GAVE A SHIT!!!"
417,RAY,417,"OKAY, HARD ASS, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? YOU'RE
IN CHARGE NOW, YOU TELL ME WHAT WE'RE
DOING!!"
418,ROBBIE,418,"WE CATCH UP WITH THESE SOLDIERS, WE
PICK UP WHOEVER ELSE ISN'T DEAD AND
WE GET BACK AT THEM!!! WE GET BACK AT
THEM!! THAT'S WHAT WE DO!!!"
419,RAY,419,"WELL, NOW LET'S TRY ONE THAT DOSEN'T
INVOLVE YOUR TEN YEAR OLD SISTER JOINING
THE ARMY! YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT???"
420,ROBBIE,420,WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US THE TRUTH???
421,RAY,421,YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT!
422,ROBBIE,422,YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHICH WAY TO GO!!
423,RAY,423,YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT?!?!?!
424,ROBBIE,424,"YOU WANNA COME OFF ALL WISE AND SHIT!!
YOU ONLY CHOSE BOSTON BECAUSE YOU HOPE
MOM IS THERE AND IF SHE'S THERE, YOU
CAN DUMP US ON HER!!! YOU CAN DUMP US
ON HER THEN YOU'LL ONLY HAVE TO CARE
ABOUT YOURSELF!!! WITCH IS EXACTLY THE
WAY YOU LIKE IT!!!"
425,RACHEL,425,"ROBBIE!!! WHERE ARE YOU TRYING TO GO?!?!
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?!?!"
426,RACHEL,426,"WHOE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME IF YOU
GO!!!"
427,RAY,427,"If I close my eyes, why don't you drive
for a bit."
428,ROBBIE,428,I don't have a license.
429,RAY,429,Since when has that stopped you?
430,ROBBIE,430,"Ray. (no response) Ray. (no response)
Dad!"
431,ROBBIE,431,"You think you could.... You think you
could..."
432,RAY,432,"Don't stop... don't take your foot off...
Okay. I got it... I got it...."
433,RACHEL,433,Where's everybody going?
434,RAY,434,I don't know Rach.
435,RACHEL,435,But we do right?
436,RAY,436,"Yeah, we do."
437,RACHEL,437,Why'd he do that?
438,RACHEL,438,Why is he doing that?
439,RAY,439,"He wants a ride. Everybody just wants
a ride."
440,RACHEL,440,Can we give him one?
441,RAY,441,"Just sit back and put on your seatbelt.
Robbie, put on your seatbelt."
442,RAY,442,Put on your seatbelt Rachel.
443,ROBBIE,443,Be careful.
444,RAY,444,"I'm sorry, I can't. Please get away
from the car."
445,RAY,445,HEY!!

476,RIOT MAN 3,476,PUT DOWN THE GOD DAMN GUN!!!
477,RAY,477,"Please, all I want is my daughter."
478,RIOT MAN 3,478,(surprisingly calm) I'm taking the car.
479,RAY,479,"I just want my daughter. Please just

482,RACHEL,482,Looks like the power's still on here.
483,RAY,483,"Yeah, power's still on because nothing
bad has come up from under the ground."
484,WOMAN,484,"Unless you are O-positive and Rh negative,

485,HARBOR MASTER,485,"Please move forward calmly, the boat

561,HARLAND,561,(to Ray) And what about you?
562,RAY,562,"(while Harland moves the wheel barrel)
(to Rachel) There you go. Is that comfortable?
I need you to close your eyes now, okay?
You need some sleep."
563,RACHEL,563,Dad?
564,RAY,564,"He's gonna meet us. Hey, Robbie's gonna
meet us, Rach, In Boston, at your grandma's."
565,RACHEL,565,"(about ready to cry) What do you think
mom's doing right this minute?"
566,RAY,566,"Mom? She's in Boston. Waiting. And I
know she's not sleeping 'cause she is
so worried about you. (trying to comfort
her) ... And she's in grandma's kitchen,
and she's making that awful tea that
she makes. And they're all just... ...
...there all just counting the minutes
until they see you again."
567,RAY,567,"(picking up the ribbon) What is this?
What... What is this?"
568,RACHEL,568,I won.
569,RAY,569,You won?
570,RACHEL,570,"The walk, trot, and canter. Third place."
571,RACHEL,571,"Sing me ""Lullaby and Goodnight""?"
572,RAY,572,"(shakes his head in displeasure because
he can't think of it) I don't remember
that one."
573,RACHEL,573,"Sing me ""Hushabye Mountain""?"
574,RAY,574,"I'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one
either."
575,RAY,575,"(begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby.
So don't put me down. Because I've got
the fastest set of wheels in the town.
Something comes up to me that don't
even try...."
576,RAY,576,"(continues singing) ... If I had a set
of wings, man, I know she could fly.
She's my little deuce coupe. You don't
know what I've got... just my little
deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't
know what I've got...."
577,HARLAND,577,Peach schnapps.
578,HARLAND,578,"Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole
case of this shit."
579,RAY,579,Thank you.
580,HARLAND,580,I'm sorry about your son.
581,RAY,581,"We got separated... he's gonna meet
us in umm... in Boston."
582,RAY,582,"Did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did
you loose anybody?"
583,HARLAND,583,All of them.
584,HARLAND,584,(introduces himself) Harland Ogilvy.
585,RAY,585,(introduces himself) Ray Ferrier.
586,HARLAND,586,"I got water... Food.... Enough for weeks.
You're welcome to stay, both of yous."
587,RAY,587,I'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep.
588,HARLAND,588,"(speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause)
Those machines, those tripods they got...
They buried them... right under our
feet. Since before there were even people
here. They've been planning this for
a million years. We're beat to shit."
589,RAY,589,"Please, my daughter."
590,HARLAND,590,"Think about it.    ...    They defeated
the greatest power in the world in a
couple days. Walked right over us.
....    And these are only the first,
they'll keep coming. This is not a war
any more than there's a war between
men and maggots. This is an extermination."
591,HARLAND,591,"(feeling he's not grasping the reality)
Are you afraid?"
592,RAY,592,Of course I am.
593,HARLAND,593,"(going on) I been around death plenty.
Drive an ambulance in the city. Well,
drove and ambulance in the city. That's
all over now, huh?    ....   You know
the people who make it Ray? The ones
that don't flatline before the hospital?
It's the ones who keep their eyes open,
keep looking at you, keep thinking.
....    There the ones who survive...
....   We can' t loose our heads
Ray.   ....   Running, that's what'll
kill you.    ......     I'm dead set
on livin'."
594,HARLAND,594,Hah. Dead set on Living.
595,RAY,595,Thank you for taking us in.
596,HARLAND,596,We're not going to be exterminated.
597,HARLAND,597,"(with shotgun at side) It's okay! Come
on, I wanna show you something!"
598,HARLAND,598,"We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta
have a weakness. Come on, take a look."
599,HARLAND,599,"Somehow they killed a few of these things
in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling
me the Japanese can figure it out but
we can't?"
600,HARLAND,600,"We can do it. We can get 'em. We can
figure it out."
601,RAY,601,Stay right there!
602,RAY,602,"I have a daughter! Why did you bring
us here?"
603,HARLAND,603,"To fight 'em together, Ray.   ....
Now we'll be the ones coming up from
underground. When the time is right,
we'll take 'em by supries, the way they
took us. We'll take 'em by surprise."
604,HARLAND,604,"We're right under their feet, Ray. Right
here, under their feet."
605,HARLAND,605,"You miss your mommy? I had a little
girl nearly your age. You know, if anything
happens to your daddy, I'll take care
of you."
606,RAY,606,Rachel!
607,RAY,607,"(distinctly angry, but not yelling)
You don't have anything to say to her,
do you understand? If you want to talk
to somebody, or ask somebody a question,
you ask me!"
608,HARLAND,608,"(also angry at Ray) What exactly is
your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna
do. How about you? You gonna sit here,
wait for them to come get you? Is that
your plan?"
609,HARLAND,609,"Maybe you want to get caught. Couple
of days hiding in a basement too much
for you, I bet. You'll probably turn
yourself right in!"
610,RAY,610,Listen. It stopped.
611,HARLAND,611,"(paying no attention) Maybe you'll be
okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll
train you as their pet. You know, train
you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks..."
612,RAY,612,(yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!
613,RAY,613,(dead silent) Give me that!
614,HARLAND,614,"You and I... I don't  think we are on
the same page."
615,HARLAND,615,RAY!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!!
616,RAY,616,KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!!! QUIET!!!
617,HARLAND,617,"(repeats for about 2 minutes) Not My
Blood!!!"
618,RAY,618,"Stop it! Stop it! You gotta stop it!
You gotta be quiet or they'll hear you!"
619,HARLAND,619,"(with an insane expression and tone)
They drink us!"
620,RAY,620,"Please, they'll hear you!"
621,HARLAND,621,"Then they spray us, like a fertilizer!"
622,RAY,622,You gotta be quiet!
623,HARLAND,623,Drink US and....
624,RAY,624,They're gonna come back down here!
625,HARLAND,625,"Then they spit us out all over their
goddamn red weeds!"
626,RAY,626,"(no longer whispering) Do you understand
what I'm gonna have to do? I can't let
my daughter die because of you."
627,HARLAND,627,"This tunnel will get us to the city.
We'll have our own tunnels there. Ready
Made! Subway, see what I'm saying!"
628,RAY,628,Stop it!
629,HARLAND,629,You can hide a whole army down there!
630,RAY,630,Stop it!!
631,HARLAND,631,... We'll go underground!
632,RAY,632,STOP IT!!!
633,HARLAND,633,Sneak attacks at night!
634,RAY,634,YOU STOP IT!!!
635,HARLAND,635,"We're the resistance Ray! They can't
occupy this country! Occupations always
fail! History's taught us that a thousand
times. This is our land."
636,HARLAND,636,"(continues) ... We eat it, we breathe
it, only we can live on it! They can't
survive here Ray. They weren't built
for it."
637,RACHEL,637,What are you doing?
638,RAY,638,"Whatever you hear... don't take this
off."
639,RACHEL,639,Dad??
640,RAY,640,Rach?
641,RACHEL,641,Dad?
642,RAY,642,"What was that song... that lullaby I
didn't know?"
643,RACHEL,643,Hushabye Mountains
644,RAY,644,"Yeah. Please, Rach, sing it."
645,RACHEL,645,(begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze....
646,RAY,646,Don't stop.
647,RACHEL,647,... On Hushabye Mountain...
648,RAY,648,That's my girl.
649,RACHEL,649,... For far away my baby goes...
650,RACHEL,650,... it fills the sails ...
651,RACHEL,651,... of boats that are waiting ...
652,RACHEL,652,... Waiting to sail your worries away
653,RACHEL,653,"... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye
Mountain ..."
654,RACHEL,654,"... Wave goodbye to the cares of the
day and watch your boat, from Hushabye
Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby
Bay."
655,RACHEL,655,(screams) AHHHH!!!

657,RAY,657,"RACHEL!!!  (to himself) Oh, my god,

678,SOLDIER 3,678,"I don't know, something's happening
to them. Please keep moving."

680,SOLDIER 4,680,"Go. Go. Just keep moving, sir."
681,RAY,681,"Excuse me, excuse me, what happened

682,SOLDIER 5,682,"No sir, it was behaving erratically,
walking in circles then it went down
on it's own about an hour ago. (to people)
Now let's keep moving, don't stop do

683,RACHEL,683,How is it dead all by it's self?

700,ROBBIE,700,Hey dad!
701,NARRATOR,701,"From the moment the invaders arrived,
breathed our air, ate and drank, they
were doomed. They were undone, destroyed,
after all of man's weapons and devices
had failed, by the tiniest creatures
that God and his wisdom, put upon this
earth. At the toll of a billion deaths,
man had earned his immunity, is right
to survive among this planet's infinite
organisms. And that right is ours against
all challenges, for men do not live
nor die in vein."
