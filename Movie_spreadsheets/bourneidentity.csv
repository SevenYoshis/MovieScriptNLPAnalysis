8,THE CAPTAIN,8,Giancarlo.
9,THE CAPTAIN,9,"We pick him up? Okay, we have to
pick him up. But that's as far as it
goes."
10,GIANCARLO,10,He needs a doctor.
11,CAPTAIN,11,"Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't
care. We've wasted two hours on this
shit already. You do what you can,
but we're not going back."
12,CAPTAIN,12,You understand me?
13,GIANCARLO,13,"Yes, sir."
14,CAPTAIN,14,Let's get back to work!
15,GIANCARLO,15,You're awake. Can you hear me?
16,GIANCARLO,16,"You've been shot. I'm trying to help
you."
17,GIANCARLO,17,"You were in the water. You've been
shot. It's okay now."
18,THE MAN,18,Where am I?
19,GIANCARLO,19,"You're American. I thought so. From
your teeth -- the dental work --"
20,THE MAN,20,Where am I?
21,GIANCARLO,21,"You're on a boat. A fishing boat.
Italian flag. We're out of Vietri."
22,GIANCARLO,22,"It's the cold that saved you. The
water. The wounds are clean. I'm not
a doctor, but the wounds, it looks
okay. It's clean."
23,THE MAN,23,How did I get here?
24,GIANCARLO,24,"You we're lost at sea. They pulled
you out."
25,GIANCARLO,25,Who are you?
26,GIANCARLO,26,"You were shot -- two bullets -- in
the back. You understand me?"
27,GIANCARLO,27,Who are you?
28,THE MAN,28,I don't know.
29,THE MAN,29,What if it doesn't come back?
30,GIANCARLO,30,I told you. You need to rest.
31,THE MAN,31,"I can read. I can read that sign on
the door. I can count. I can talk..."
32,THE MAN,32,What are you doing?
33,THE MAN,33,What is that?
34,GIANCARLO,34,"It came from your hip. Under the
skin."
35,GIANCARLO,35,You have a bank in Zurich.
36,GIANCARLO,36,You remember Zurich?
37,THE MAN,37,No.
38,GIANCARLO,38,"Look, I'm just on this boat, okay?
I'm an engineer. Whatever this is,
it's not for me to be involved, okay?"
39,THE MAN,39,I don't remember Zurich.
40,GIANCARLO,40,You drink rum?
41,THE MAN,41,I don't know.
42,THE MAN,42,"I don't know who I am. Do you know
who I am? Do have any idea who I am?"
43,THE MAN,43,"Tell me who I am. If you know who I
am, please stop fucking around and
tell me."
44,GIANCARLO,44,"It's not much, but it should get you
to Switzerland."
45,THE MAN,45,I won't forget this.
46,TICKET AGENT,46,Una sola via?
47,THE MAN,47,Si. One way. Una sola via.
48,WOMBOSI,48,"...no, no, no -- the time is not
right, my enemies are too strong.
I'm telling you to wait for this,
you understand? I'm telling you this,
and I'm making a warning to all those
peoples out there that think that my
powers have become so weak that they
can play with me as they wish. You
will see -- I will tell you when the
evidence is clear. Then you will
have a story. My old friends will
hear about themselves."
49,MARSHALL,49,"That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in
Paris the day before yesterday. I'm
sure most of you have a passing
knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of
you on the African desks have worked
with him over the years. Some of you
very closely..."
50,MARSHALL,50,"...He was an irritation before he
took power. He was a problem when he
was in power. And he's been a disaster
for us in exile."
51,MARSHALL,51,"Wombosi likes to send us messages
through the European media. This is
an interview we pulled down from a
local German television station in
Dresden. We've been getting these
little broadsides every couple of
months. He knows this -- he knows
that -- he's writing a book about
the Agency's history in Africa --
he's going to name names. It's
basically a shakedown..."
52,MARSHALL,52,"This interview -- and I'll make the
tape available for anyone who wants
it -- he goes on to claim that he
has just survived an assassination
attempt. He says it's us. He says
he's got proof."
53,MARSHALL,53,"The overwhelming negative
ramifications of this should be
obvious."
54,MARSHALL,54,"The Director wants to know if there
is any possible shred of truth in
this accusation."
55,ZURICH COP #1 (O.S.),55,Can't you read the signs?
56,ZURICH COP #2,56,On your feet. Let's go. Right now.
57,ZURICH COP #1,57,"The park is closed. There's no
sleeping in the park."
58,ZURICH COP #2,58,Let's see some identification.
59,ZURICH COP #1,59,Come on. Your papers. Let's go.
60,THE MAN,60,I've lost them. I've...
61,THE MAN,61,My papers. They are lost.
62,ZURICH COP #1,62,Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up.
63,ZURICH COP #2,63,-- come on -- hands up -- up --
64,THE MAN,64,"-- look, I'm just trying to sleep
okay? --"
65,THE MAN,65,-- I just need to sleep --
66,ZURICH COP #2,66,"-- no -- please God no -- please
don't -- please no -- my Go"
67,CONKLIN,67,What?
68,ZORN,68,Abbott wants to talk.
69,CONKLIN,69,Tell him we're busy.
70,ZORN,70,I tried.
71,ABBOTT,71,"Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It
looks like rain and I don't have a
thing to wear."
72,CONKLIN,72,I don't know what we're talking about.
73,ABBOTT,73,"We're talking about Marseille. We're
talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And
I'm asking you if this abortion in
Marseille has anything to do with
Treadstone."
74,ABBOTT,74,Was this Treadstone?
75,CONKLIN,75,You're asking me a direct question?
76,ABBOTT,76,Yes.
77,CONKLIN,77,"I thought you were never going to do
that."
78,ABBOTT,78,"They're putting together an agency
oversight committee. They're going
to look through everyone's budgets.
Treadstone is a rather sizable line
item in my ledger."
79,ABBOTT,79,What am I going to do about that?
80,CONKLIN,80,"You'd want to make that go away.
You'd want to remind them that
Treadstone is a training organization.
That it's all theoretical. You'd
want to sign off on that."
81,ABBOTT,81,And what if I couldn't do that?
82,CONKLIN,82,"Then I'd have to explain Treadstone.
And you'd have to explain how you
let me get this far."
83,CONKLIN,83,"Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B,
does it?"
84,CONKLIN,84,"We'll clean up the field. You clean
up your budgets."
85,RECEPTIONIST,85,Can I help you?
86,THE MAN,86,I'm here about a numbered account.
87,RECEPTIONIST,87,"If you'll just enter your account
number here I'll direct you to the
appropriate officer."
88,BANK GUARD #1,88,"They've been waiting your hand, sir..."
89,APFEL,89,"Good morning, sir. I assume you're
here about your box."
90,THE MAN,90,...yes...
91,THE MAN,91,The box.
92,BOURNE,92,My name is Jason Bourne.
93,BOURNE,93,"Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason
Bourne, nice to meet you."
94,BOURNE,94,"Bourne. My name is Jason Bourne. I
live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris."
95,BOURNE,95,"I'm trying to think how long it's
been since I was here."
96,DEPOSIT GUARD,96,I'm not sure. Must be three weeks.
97,MARIE (O.S.),97,"-- no, this is not my current address.
It was my current address two days
ago when I started standing in line
outside --"
98,MARIE,98,"-- and so now I lost my apartment, I
have no address, and I have no visa,
and you keep telling me how much
help you cannot give me!"
99,CLERK,99,"Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna
have to ask you to keep your voice
down."
100,MARIE,100,"All the papers -- all the papers
they asked for -- I brought all the
papers --"
101,CLERK,101,"Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you
entered into a fraudulent marriage
in an effort to circumvent the
immigration laws of the United States --"
102,MARIE,102,"You only know that because I told
you!"
103,MARIE,103,"Ask the case officer -- find his
name -- it's on the papers -- I told
him all this myself! --"
104,CLERK,104,"-- it's not the source of the
information that's important here --"
105,MARIE,105,"-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid
him four thousand dollars -- my last
four thousand dollars to marry me,
okay? -- I told this to the case
officer last week..."
106,MARIE,106,"...here -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr.
Thomas I didn't know this guy was
already married -- I admitted this!"
107,CLERK,107,"-- Miss Kreutz, please --"
108,MARIE,108,"-- I'm the one that got ripped off! --
not you -- not the United States
government -- me -- I'm the one being
ripped off!"
109,CLERK,109,"So now you're asking for a student
visa?"
110,CONKLIN,110,-- and they're sure it's him? --
111,ZORN,111,-- he accessed the account --
112,CONKLIN,112,-- but it was him --
113,ZORN,113,"-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --"
114,MAN ON LINE (O.S.),114,You're up.
115,WOMAN CLERK,115,You're a U.S. Citizen?
116,BOURNE,116,Yes.
117,BOURNE,117,"I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes..."
118,WOMAN CLERK,118,"Well, either you are, or you aren't."
119,BOURNE,119,Right.
120,WOMAN CLERK,120,You have your passport?
121,BOURNE,121,I have a passport. I've got...
122,BOURNE,122,"Actually, it's a little complicated."
123,WOMAN CLERK,123,"Do you have your passport, sir?"
124,BOURNE,124,"Look, maybe I should just..."
125,WOMAN CLERK,125,"Sir, you waited on line."
126,BOURNE,126,"Yeah, I know..."
127,SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.),127,-- stop! -- stop right there! --

135,SECURITY CHIEF,135,-- we're evacuating the building --
136,DEPUTY DCM,136,"-- we're in the middle of a trade
meeting! --"
137,SECURITY CHIEF,137,"-- call the code! -- I want everyone
out! --"
138,DEPUTY DCM,138,-- you gotta give me more to go on --
139,SECURITY CHIEF,139,"-- he's running from the cops, he's
got a bag filled with God knows what,
he's in the building and I don't
know where! --"
140,VOICE (O.S.),140,"-- no! -- the other way! -- take the
backstairs! -- the backstairs! --

up --"
145,MARIE,145,Motherfucking sonsofbitches!
146,MARIE,146,What are you looking at?
147,BOURNE,147,I need a ride.
148,MARIE,148,What?
149,BOURNE,149,I need a ride out of here.
150,MARIE,150,"Oh, Jesus..."
151,BOURNE,151,Please. I don't want to scare you.
152,MARIE,152,It's a little late for that.
153,BOURNE,153,I've got a situation here and --
154,MARIE,154,Get the fuck away from my car.
155,BOURNE,155,"I'll give you ten thousand dollars
to drive me to Paris."
156,MARIE,156,"Great. You know what? I'll give you
ten gazillion dollars to get the
fuck away from me before I start
screaming my head off."
157,BOURNE,157,"You don't want the police any more
than I do."
158,MARIE,158,Jesus...
159,BOURNE,159,Get me out of here. Please.
160,CONKLIN,160,"go -- keep going -- go...wait --
stop -- you went past it --"
161,CONKLIN,161,"It's him. My God, it's really him..."
162,COM TECH #2,162,"-- we got a cross-ref ready to go
here, sir, we're running hotel,
airline, train, and medical variables,
anything else you'd like?"
163,CONKLIN,163,No...
164,CONKLIN,164,Go ahead. Run it.
165,CONKLIN,165,"Let's get a map, let's get a grid
map on Zurich."
166,ZORN,166,Sir...
167,CONKLIN,167,What?
168,ZORN,168,"Zurich police are looking for an
American with a red bag. Apparently
he put two cops in the hospital last
night."
169,CONKLIN,169,What the fuck is he doing?
170,ZORN,170,"Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying
to send us a message."
171,CONKLIN,171,"It doesn't matter now. We've just
got to be the first ones there."
172,CONKLIN,172,"Get everybody up. I want them all
activated."
173,ZORN,173,All of them?
174,CONKLIN,174,You heard me.
175,COM TECH #2,175,"Sir, the cross-ref is coming up
cold..."
176,MARIE,176,So what's in Paris?
177,BOURNE,177,I want to go home.
178,MARIE,178,For twenty thousand dollars.
179,BOURNE,179,I said ten thousand.
180,MARIE,180,You have blood on your pants.
181,BOURNE,181,Okay.
182,BOURNE,182,Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.
183,MARIE,183,"No. No, that was too easy --"
184,BOURNE,184,Wait up --
185,BOURNE,185,-- just wait up --
186,MARIE,186,"-- get the fuck out of here -- all
this money, this crazy offer, I mean
give me a fucking break with this,
this is --"
187,BOURNE,187,"Look, I want a ride to Paris."
188,BOURNE,188,That's all I want. I swear.
189,MARIE,189,You swear?
190,MARIE,190,"That's great. I feel so much better
now."
191,BOURNE,191,"I don't want anything but a ride.
All I want to do is go home."
192,MARIE,192,"You could buy a car for twenty grand.
You could buy this car."
193,BOURNE,193,"I don't want to go alone. I want you
to drive me to Paris. Like we're a
couple. Like we're a couple and we're
travelling together. That's all we're
doing."
194,MARIE,194,"And I don't get hurt. I get twenty
thousand dollars and I don't get
hurt."
195,BOURNE,195,I won't hurt you.
196,MARIE,196,What if I say no?
197,BOURNE,197,Then I'll find another ride.
198,MARIE,198,"Just so you know, if you're gonna
burn me on the money, you might as
well kill me."
199,MARIE,199,"I was supposed to have this car back
three days ago. It's not my car."
200,BOURNE,200,I know that.
201,MARIE,201,Shit --
202,MARIE,202,"Can I tell you how much you're
freaking me out? Okay? Because you
are -- you're completely freaking me
out."
203,BOURNE,203,"I'm sorry. Really. What do you want
me to do?"
204,MARIE,204,"I don't know. Smile. Sneeze.
Something. You've got a bag full of
money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it,
I don't know..."
205,MARIE,205,What kind of music do you like?
206,BOURNE,206,I don't know.
207,MARIE,207,What does that mean?
208,BOURNE,208,Listen to what you want.
209,MARIE,209,"Who pays twenty thousand dollars for
a ride to Paris?"
210,BOURNE,210,I don't know. I don't know who I am.
211,MARIE,211,"Yeah, well, welcome to the club."
212,BOURNE,212,"No. No, I mean, I really don't know
who I am. I can't remember anything
earlier than two weeks ago."
213,BOURNE,213,I'm serious.
214,MARIE,214,What? Like amnesia?
215,BOURNE,215,"Look, go ahead... put the radio on..."
216,MARIE,216,Amnesia?
217,MARIE,217,"You're saying you don't remember
anything that happened before two
weeks ago?"
218,BOURNE,218,That's what I'm saying.
219,MARIE,219,Give me a fucking break.
220,MORGUE BOSS,220,"Okay, Monsieur Kane... number 121..."
221,WOMBOSI,221,Get the fuck out of my way --
222,WOMBOSI,222,It's not him.
223,WOMBOSI,223,So who's crazy now?
224,MARIE,224,"And you have no idea -- not a clue --
what came before that?"
225,BOURNE,225,No.
226,MARIE,226,"When you think of it, before the
ship -- before you wake up on the
ship, what do you see?"
227,BOURNE,227,Nothing. It's just not there.
228,MARIE,228,"Well, this is great."
229,MARIE,229,"I'm sick of myself and you have no
idea who you are."
230,BOURNE,230,"I kept trying things, I thought if I
could find all the things I could
do, I could --"
231,MARIE,231,-- you could put it together --
232,BOURNE,232,"-- which was okay for a while, I was
okay with it..."
233,BOURNE,233,"But then -- there's all these other
things -- all these other things I
know how to do -- and this -- this
stuff from the bank and..."
234,BOURNE,234,I think something bad happened.
235,MARIE,235,What are you talking about?
236,BOURNE,236,I don't know.
237,MARIE,237,"Sounds like you were in an accident
or something."
238,BOURNE,238,I was shot twice in the back.
239,MARIE,239,"Okay, so you're a victim."
240,BOURNE,240,"There was a gun. Who has a safe
deposit box with a gun and all this
money and all these passports?"
241,MARIE,241,"Lots of people have guns. You're
American. Americans love guns."
242,BOURNE,242,"I fought my way out of an embassy.
I climbed down a fifty-foot wall --
I went out the window and I was doing
it -- I just did it. I knew how to
do it."
243,MARIE,243,"People do amazing things when they're
scared."
244,BOURNE,244,"Why do I? -- I come in here --
instinctively -- first thing I do --
I'm looking for the exit -- I'm
catching the sightlines -- I know I
can't sit with my back to the door --"
245,MARIE,245,"You're paranoid. You were shot. It's
natural."
246,BOURNE,246,"I can tell you the license plate
numbers of all three cars out front.
I can tell you that the waitress is
left-handed and the guy at the counter
weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds
and knows how to handle himself. I
know that the best, first place to
look for a gun is the cab of that
grey truck outside. I know that at
this altitude I can run flat out for
half a mile before I lose my edge. I
knew that you were my first, best
option out of Zurich? How do I know
all that? How can I know all that
and not know who I am? How is that
possible?"
247,MARIE,247,"God, you're not kidding, are you?"
248,CONKLIN,248,"And that's the best angle of the
courtyard?"
249,RESEARCH TECH #1,249,That's the only angle.
250,CONKLIN,250,"What do they have on the streets?
The area. They must have something."
251,RESEARCH TECH #1,251,Hang on...
252,CONKLIN,252,What?
253,ZORN,253,"Abbott. He knows about the embassy.
He's coming down for a show and tell."
254,CONKLIN,254,That'll solve all our problems.
255,RESEARCH TECH #1,255,Sir...
256,CONKLIN,256,What's that?
257,RESEARCH TECH #1,257,"It's an angle of the street -- some
sort of alleyway -- you can just..."
258,CONKLIN,258,Enhance it.
259,CONKLIN (O.S.),259,Who the hell is that?
260,MARIE,260,I needed a break.
261,BOURNE,261,Where are we?
262,MARIE,262,We're about an hour away.
263,BOURNE,263,I can't believe I slept.
264,MARIE,264,You were tired. Here...
265,MARIE,265,"For twenty-thousand I like to throw
in breakfast."
266,MARIE,266,So what do you dream about?
267,BOURNE,267,"I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm
asleep and I can't wake up."
268,BOURNE,268,I don't think I smoke.
269,MARIE,269,"You ever think maybe you have a
family?"
270,BOURNE,270,I thought about it. I don't know.
271,MARIE,271,"I guess it's like Christmas every
day for you, huh?"
272,ABBOTT,272,Who is she?
273,ZORN,273,"Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty-
six. Born outside Munich. Father was
a welder. He died in '91. We don't
have the mother. There might be a
step-sister, we're trying to track
that down."
274,ZORN,274,"It's tough. She's a wanderer. She
pops up on the grid here and there
but... I mean, the last time she
paid an electric bill in Europe was
'94. No taxes. No steady employer.
She's got three arrests. Two
shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one
in Germany. And she actually did
three months in an Italian detention
center for credit card fraud."
275,ABBOTT,275,No political affiliations?
276,CONKLIN,276,"She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's
a great one."
277,ABBOTT,277,"I'm assuming we're exploring that
possibility."
278,CONKLIN,278,We're exploring every possibility.
279,CONKLIN,279,"We are in pursuit. How much more do
you want me to tell you?"
280,ABBOTT,280,"Pursuit would indicate that you know
exactly where he is."
281,CONKLIN,281,"No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly
where he is."
282,ABBOTT,282,"Yes, well, I think we need some fresh
eyes on this problem. I'm bringing
in some people from upstairs."
283,CONKLIN,283,"We've been down here for two weeks
banging our heads against the wall.
We've been sleeping down here. We
just got our first lead fourteen
hours ago, and now? -- now that we
finally have something to work with --
you want to bring planning personnel
down here?"
284,CONKLIN,284,I'd rethink that.
285,ABBOTT,285,I want a second opinion.
286,CONKLIN,286,This is an operations desk.
287,ABBOTT,287,I'm not asking.
288,BOURNE,288,"Slow down. No, don't stop. Just..."
289,MARIE,289,That's it? Is that it?
290,BOURNE,290,Four-fifty. That's the address...
291,MARIE,291,Looks familiar?
292,BOURNE,292,No.
293,BOURNE,293,No. Go around. Keep going...
294,MARIE,294,Where?
295,BOURNE,295,Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.
296,MARIE,296,"So this is it, right?"
297,BOURNE,297,I guess.
298,MARIE,298,I should go.
299,BOURNE,299,I don't remember any of this.
300,MARIE,300,Jason...
301,BOURNE,301,"Sorry. The money, right?"
302,MARIE,302,"Okay, so..."
303,BOURNE,303,Thanks for the ride.
304,MARIE,304,Anytime.
305,BOURNE,305,"Look, I don't know what's up there."
306,MARIE,306,You got me pretty fucking curious.
307,BOURNE,307,"Look, you could come up. Or you could
wait if you want. I could go check
it out. You could wait."
308,MARIE,308,Nah...
309,MARIE,309,"With you, I mean, you'd probably
just forget about me, right?"
310,BOURNE,310,How could I forget about you?
311,BOURNE,311,You're the only person I know.
312,MARIE,312,I guess you're not home.
313,CONCIERGE (O.S.),313,Monsieur Bourne...I'm coming...
314,CONCIERGE,314,"Mr. Bourne, there you are -- I was
wondering -- I haven't seen you --"
315,BOURNE,315,Here I am.
316,BOURNE,316,I seem to have lost my key.
317,CONCIERGE,317,"I've been ringing your bell. It's
good you were away. We had some
trouble with the hot water. It's
been repaired."
318,BOURNE,318,Great. We could use a shower.
319,BOURNE,319,It was a long drive.
320,MARIE,320,It's big.
321,MARIE,321,This is like a real apartment.
322,MARIE,322,This is really yours?
323,BOURNE,323,I guess so.
324,BOURNE,324,This is my frying pan.
325,BOURNE,325,This is my spoon.
326,BOURNE,326,"I'm Jason Bourne and this is my
kitchen."
327,MARIE,327,This is your office?
328,MARIE,328,"God, you live like a monk..."
329,BOURNE,329,"All this stuff -- it's all about
boats."
330,BOURNE,330,I think I'm in the shipping business.
331,MARIE,331,"See. It's starting to come back,
yeah?"
332,MARIE,332,You mind if I take a bath?
333,BOURNE,333,Go ahead.
334,PHONE MACHINE,334,"""You have no messages."""
335,OPERATOR/PHONE,335,"Bonjour, Hotel Marboeuf..."
336,BOURNE,336,...yes -- oui -- uh...
337,OPERATOR/PHONE,337,"Yes, sir. Hotel Marboeuf, Paris.
How can I direct your call?"
338,BOURNE,338,Paris?
339,OPERATOR/PHONE,339,"Yes, sir..."
340,OPERATOR/PHONE,340,How can I help you?
341,BOURNE,341,"Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason
Bourne."
342,OPERATOR/PHONE,342,"One moment, please..."
343,OPERATOR/PHONE,343,"I'm afraid, I have no one by that
name registered, sir."
344,BOURNE,344,D'accord... Merci.
345,BOURNE,345,Un moment -- un moment --
346,OPERATOR/PHONE,346,-- sir? --
347,BOURNE,347,"-- hang on -- I need you to check
another name for me -- hang on -- un
moment, s'il vous plait --"
348,BOURNE,348,"Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael
Kane?"
349,OPERATOR/PHONE,349,"One moment, sir."
350,MANAGER/PHONE,350,Bonjour? Monsieur? Allo...
351,BOURNE,351,"Yes, I'm here..."
352,MANAGER/PHONE,352,"You call about Monsieur Kane? John
Michael Kane?"
353,BOURNE,353,Yes. Is he there?
354,MANAGER/PHONE,354,You are a friend of his?
355,BOURNE,355,Yes.
356,MANAGER/PHONE,356,"I have some very bad news for you,
sir. I'm terrible sorry to have to
tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has
passed away almost two weeks ago..."
357,MANAGER/PHONE,357,"There was an accident. On the
motorway. Apparently, he was killed
instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry
to be the one to tell you this..."
358,BOURNE,358,...I understand...
359,MANAGER/PHONE,359,"...we actually, we were unaware for
several days that this had happened.
When they came for his things, it
was made known for us, you see?"
360,BOURNE,360,Who? Who came?
361,MANAGER/PHONE,361,His brother. You know his brother?
362,BOURNE,362,Right. Yes. Of course.
363,MANAGER/PHONE,363,"It's very bad this. Terrible sad.
Such a young man."
364,BOURNE,364,"Do you -- his brother -- do you have
a phone number?"
365,MANAGER/PHONE,365,I think not...
366,MANAGER/PHONE,366,"No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden.
He was here very briefly."
367,MARIE,367,"She wasn't kidding about the water.
It's freezing."
368,BOURNE,368,Hang on. I'll check the kitchen...
369,BOURNE,369,"Maybe it takes a while to get all
the way upstairs."
370,BOURNE,370,"Yeah, it's cold in here, too..."
371,BOURNE,371,Let's give it another minute.
372,MARIE,372,-- omigod! --
373,MARIE,373,-- what're you? -- no -- no --
374,BOURNE,374,"-- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not
like that --"
375,MARIE,375,-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
376,BOURNE,376,-- quiet -- quiet --
377,MARIE,377,...what are you doing?...
378,MARIE,378,"omigod -- omigod -- what're you doing? --
what're you doing? --"
379,MARIE,379,"-- what is he? -- what've you? --
omigod -- what is this? --"
380,MARIE,380,"-- what're you doing? -- Jason,
please, tell me what's happening!"
381,BOURNE,381,Open it --
382,BOURNE,382,-- do it -- what's he got in there?
383,BOURNE,383,Who are you?
384,BOURNE,384,-- who are you?
385,BOURNE,385,"-- who are you? -- tell me who you
are -- who sent you? --"
386,BOURNE,386,"-- what is this about? -- YOU'VE GOT
TO TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT! --"
387,BOURNE,387,WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
388,MARIE,388,"...omigod, no..."
389,BOURNE,389,What? -- what? --
390,BOURNE,390,-- what is it?
391,MARIE,391,"...this is my picture... he's got my
picture --"
392,MARIE,392,"-- this is me -- this is Zurich --
this... this... this is yesterday --"
393,BOURNE,393,-- just --
394,MARIE,394,-- where does this come from? --
395,MARIE,395,How do you have my picture?
396,BOURNE,396,"Marie, just --"
397,BOURNE,397,-- just stay there! -- just --
398,MARIE,398,"-- he's got my picture! -- this is
yesterday! -- this is me! --"
399,MARIE,399,-- where did you get my picture? --
400,BOURNE,400,"-- let me do this, okay? --"
401,MARIE,401,"-- do what? -- what are you doing? --
he's got my picture --"
402,MARIE,402,"-- he's -- my God -- look at him --
he's bleeding to death -- my picture --
look! -- he was trying to kill us! --
omigod --"
403,THE CONCIERGE,403,"Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's
going on? Is everything all right in
there?"
404,THE CONCIERGE,404,"--I'm calling the police, Mr.  Bourne --
you give me no choice -- I'm calling
them right away! --"
405,BOURNE,405,"-- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? --
where are your shoes? -- Marie --"
406,MARIE,406,He's dead isn't he?
407,BOURNE,407,"Marie -- look at me -- there's no
time for this --"
408,MARIE,408,"He went out the window -- why? --
why would someone do that?"
409,BOURNE,409,"-- we can't stay here -- I can't
stay here -- it's not safe here --"
410,MARIE,410,He came to kill us.
411,BOURNE,411,"-- we can go -- I can get us out of
here -- but we have to go now --"
412,MARIE,412,You knew he was coming.
413,BOURNE,413,No.
414,MARIE,414,I trusted you.
415,BOURNE,415,You're wrong. I didn't know.
416,MARIE,416,"I don't trust anybody and I trusted
you!"
417,BOURNE,417,I didn't know this would happen.
418,MARIE,418,"He had my picture! He knew I was
here! He came here to kill us!"
419,BOURNE,419,And where is he now?
420,BOURNE,420,"You believe what you want, but I'm
telling you the truth -- I never
would have brought you here if I
thought it was dangerous."
421,MARIE,421,"Oh, Jesus..."
422,BOURNE,422,"You stay -- if you want, you stay --
it's okay -- it's better -- maybe
it's better -- I don't know --"
423,BOURNE,423,But I can't stay here. I can't.
424,MARIE,424,But the police --
425,BOURNE,425,-- there's no time --
426,MARIE,426,-- we'll explain it --
427,BOURNE,427,-- how? --
428,MARIE,428,"-- there's two of us -- we'll tell
them -- we'll just --"
429,BOURNE,429,-- forget it --
430,MARIE,430,-- we'll tell them what happened --
431,BOURNE,431,I don't know what happened!
432,BOURNE,432,"I don't know who he is! I don't know
what he wants! I don't even know who
I am! The only thing I know is that
if I stay here, I'm never gonna find
out!"
433,BOURNE,433,Come with me.
434,BOURNE,434,"I can get us out of here. I know it.
Then we can think. Then we can work
it out. We'll explain it then.  Once
we're safe."
435,BOURNE,435,I can protect you.
436,WOMBOSI,436,"-- No! -- I say, no! -- they go this
far -- out a body in the grave --
another body! -- no! -- this isn't
over -- these people are not finished --
nothing will make them finish until
they have Wombosi! -- the real Wombosi --
until I'm the one in the box! --"
437,WOMBOSI,437,-- what are you doing? --
438,WOMBOSI,438,-- sleeping? --
439,WOMBOSI,439,"-- he's sleeping! -- this man is
sleeping at his post! --"
440,WOMBOSI,440,-- I've had men killed for this! --
441,WOMBOSI,441,"-- you think these people? -- these
people who come for me -- you think
they sleep? -- they never sleep! --
they spend all the day -- all the
night -- all time thinking about how
to put Wombosi in that box! --"
442,WOMBOSI,442,"-- there is no box for Wombosi! --
they don't have a box that can hold
me! -- I know these people -- I know
they never sleep! -- I know they
never stop! -- they never stop until
the knife is at their throat! --"
443,WOMBOSI,443,"-- what is the window? -- this window
is open! -- who leaves this open! --"
444,WOMBOSI,444,"-- this is a war, you fool! -- you
think these people are like you? --
you think this is stupid people? --
careless people? -- these people see
an open window, they reach in with a
big hand and grab your heart until
you die! --"
445,WOMBOSI,445,"-- and it won't just be me! -- they
don't just want Wombosi now! -- they
want my babies -- they want my
children! -- and I say no! --"
446,WOMBOSI,446,"-- you leave that window open again,
you better pray they kill me --"
447,WOMBOSI,447,"-- everything changes here now! --
everyone is a soldier here now! --
this is a fortress now! Are we clear
with this?"
448,DEAUVAGE,448,"Yes, sir. All clear."
449,WOMBOSI,449,"This man is out there. Kane is out
there. And they pretend he's dead.
That means he's coming back."

456,MRS. DOYLE,456,"He's not lying. He's very highly
stressed, but he's not lying. He's
confused. He's aggressively searching
for a way out of the chaos. This
conversation, the video from the
consulate -- the body language, vocal
pattern -- it's my sense he's really
lost here."
457,MRS. DOYLE,457,I think he snapped.
458,CONKLIN,458,Is that a medical term?
459,MRS. DOYLE,459,"You want clinical terminology? It's
called, ""conversation hysteria."""
460,MRS. DOYLE,460,"I don't know exactly how you train
these people. I'm not sure I want to
know. I'll take a guess there's some
extremely rigorous behavior
modification going on here."
461,ABBOTT,461,Let's assume that's true.

Even machines break down."

get a second opinion -- and nothing
changes. He's loose. He's out of
control. It's very clear what needs
to happen."
466,CONKLIN,466,I have work to do.
467,ABBOTT,467,"What if he is working for someone
else? What if he turned?"
468,CONKLIN,468,"Turn? To who? Where does he turn?
What does he have to offer? He's got
nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece
of equipment for crissake. Where's
he gonna turn?"
469,BOURNE,469,No.
470,BOURNE,470,"You know who you are. You know what
that's worth? That's everything."
471,BOURNE,471,"I can't live like this. I can't do
anything until I know who I am.
Believe me, you don't want what I
have."
472,MARIE,472,"You stayed there five times in the
past six months. But I didn't have
time -- I could only get the bill
from the last stay -- you were there
for two days. Some room service --
there's half a dozen phone calls
here so that's someth--"
473,BOURNE,473,Who paid the bill?
474,MARIE,474,It's a company... MPG Capital.

500,RAWLINS,500,"Come right in... please... have a
seat."
501,BOURNE,501,Thanks.
502,RAWLINS,502,Well...
503,RAWLINS,503,"I must admit, when my assistant told
me you were here I was, really -- I
was quite -- I was surprised."
504,BOURNE,504,Really.
505,RAWLINS,505,We thought you were gone for good.
506,BOURNE,506,Did you?
507,RAWLINS,507,"Well, I mean it's a tough business,
isn't it? Cutthroat."
508,RAWLINS,508,"Look, our bid -- it was competitive --
but definitely at the high end of
competitive -- when we didn't hear
back from you, we did some re-analysis
of the numbers, and honestly, we'd
really like a chance to do a bit
better."
509,RAWLINS,509,"I'm assuming you're still in the
market. It's the same vessel?"
510,BOURNE,510,Yes.
511,RAWLINS,511,"We just picked up a job quite like
the one we were bidding for you.
Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy-
five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think
we learned a few things that might
allow us to make our proposal for
your job, as I said, a bit more
competitive."
512,BOURNE,512,Okay.
513,RAWLINS,513,Was it the break-in?
514,BOURNE,514,Excuse me?
515,RAWLINS,515,"We also thought we hadn't heard from
you -- we've had a bit of a publicity
nightmare, people have been talking."
516,RAWLINS,516,"Our offices were broken into --
vandalism mostly -- shortly after we
last spoke."
517,BOURNE,517,I hadn't heard.
518,RAWLINS,518,"Let me get you a new copy of the
proposal."
519,BOURNE,519,That'd be great.
520,MARIE,520,I found it.
521,MARIE,521,It took six calls.
522,MARIE,522,I found Kane. I found the body.
523,BOURNE,523,Let's go --
524,BOURNE,524,We got to get away from this phone.
525,ATTENDANT #1,525,What was the name again?
526,BOURNE,526,Kane. John Michael Kane.
527,ATTENDANT #2,527,It's number 121.
528,BOURNE,528,I want to see the body.
529,ATTENDANT #1,529,"Our boss could come back. We're not
supposed to."
530,MARIE,530,What?
531,MORGUE BOSS (O.S.),531,What the hell's going on here?
532,ATTENDANT #1,532,"This guy, he came to see the American,
but the body, it's missing."
533,MORGUE BOSS,533,They came last night.  His brother.
534,ATTENDANT #2,534,It's not in the book.
535,MORGUE BOSS,535,Who are these people?
536,MORGUE BOSS,536,Who are you? What's going on here?
537,BOURNE,537,Where did this body go?
538,MORGUE BOSS,538,"I said, someone came last night --"
539,MORGUE BOSS,539,"Look, this isn't a carnival -- people
call and they make an appointment
and they follow the rules -- everyone
signs in and out -- this is a serious
place -- serious work -- it's not
just to come in whenever you like --"
540,BOURNE,540,"Shit, we didn't sign in."
541,MORGUE BOSS,541,So get the hell out of here.
542,BOURNE,542,"Fine. But I'd like to sign in. In
fact, I insist on it. Where's the
book? I gotta sign in --"
543,BOURNE,543,Is this it? --
544,BOURNE,544,"-- this is it, right? --"
545,MORGUE BOSS,545,"-- slow down -- you can't just take
the book like that --"
546,BOURNE,546,"-- don't sweat it, I have a pen --
no problem -- just let me find the
page --"
547,BOURNE,547,"-- honey, why don't you wait for me
outside, okay? --"
548,MORGUE BOSS,548,"-- we have rules here, this is a
very serious place -- I'm the one
who decides who gets in here, okay? --"
549,BOURNE,549,"-- what do I? -- I put the name of
the person I came to see? --"
550,MORGUE BOSS,550,"-- this is serious business down
here and we cannot have people coming
and going --"
551,BOURNE,551,-- here we go -- I found it --
552,MORGUE BOSS,552,"-- what are you? -- what are you
doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped
the book! -- you stupid fucki--"

in there? --"
556,BOURNE,556,Nykwana Wombosi.
557,MARIE,557,What is that?
558,BOURNE,558,"It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty
million dollar yacht. He's the proud
owner of an Alliance Security package."
559,BOURNE,559,"He also paid a visit to the morgue
to see John Michael Kane."
560,MARIE,560,What does that mean?
561,MARIE,561,"Jason, what does that mean?"
562,MARIE,562,"Jason, please... who is he?"
563,BOURNE,563,I don't know.
564,MARIE,564,So what are we doing?
565,BOURNE,565,Go back to the hotel.
566,ZORN,566,They found him. They found Bourne.
567,ABBOTT,567,Where?
568,ZORN,568,You better come in.
569,DEAUVAGE,569,"Jesus fuck, what is this?"
570,ABBOTT,570,Omigod.
571,CONKLIN,571,-- how long? --
572,COMM TECH #1,572,-- minutes -- he's close --
573,ABBOTT,573,-- he went inside! --
574,CONKLIN,574,-- if we can get a clean shot --
575,ABBOTT,575,-- inside the house? --
576,CONKLIN,576,"-- that's what they're trained for --
just a surgical strike."
577,ABBOTT,577,Forget it.
578,CONKLIN,578,What do you want to do?
579,ABBOTT,579,We don't know what we're into!
580,CONKLIN,580,"We're in the shitter, man! Pick your
poison. Maybe he's in there to finish
the job. Maybe he's working for
Wombosi. Maybe they want to go on TV
together. Every possibility sucks --
we've got to move!"
581,BOURNE,581,Is he here?
582,CONKLIN,582,"You don't have the stones for this.
You people come down here and wink
and whisper and we send these guys
out and get it done. And you're clear.
And the guys upstairs get what they
want. And the whole bunch of you are
so stuffed on deniability it's coming
out of your ears."
583,CONKLIN,583,"Well, you know what? You're here
now. What do you want to do?"
584,WOMBOSI,584,Come in.
585,WOMBOSI,585,Please...
586,WOMBOSI,586,"Did you bring investment advice for
me tonight? It was tax shelters,
wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps."
587,BOURNE,587,MPG Capital.
588,WOMBOSI,588,"I think investment advice from a
dead man, it's a bad idea."
589,WOMBOSI,589,How does it feel to be dead?
590,BOURNE,590,"It's a lot more stressful than I
thought."
591,WOMBOSI,591,"-- no -- no, let them in! -- let
them in."
592,WOMBOSI,592,Come in -- on y va -- come in...
593,WOMBOSI,593,"I think everyone wants to see the
dead man."
594,WOMBOSI,594,What do you do?
595,WOMBOSI,595,"You get an appointment with me? You
make sure it's on the boat? You come
visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit
investment package. You drink my
water -- eat my bread -- play with
my children -- and what? -- two nights
later you come back and you put this
death --"
596,WOMBOSI,596,-- you put this in my engine room!
597,WOMBOSI,597,"So this is a different kind of
meeting."
598,WOMBOSI,598,"Maybe now we talk some truth, okay?
One dead man to another."
599,WOMBOSI,599,You see this?
600,WOMBOSI,600,I told you my shot was better!
601,DEAUVAGE,601,"He went in the water -- how did he
live?"
602,WOMBOSI,602,"No, no no..."
603,WOMBOSI,603,"This is a strong killer. This is a
crazy strong killer. Oh, yeah..."
604,WOMBOSI,604,"To make a killer that looks like
you? This young? This face?"
605,WOMBOSI,605,It's bloody fucking amazing.
606,BOURNE,606,Who do you think sent me?
607,WOMBOSI,607,"I know who sent you. I don't know
why."
608,WOMBOSI,608,"I learned many, many things from the
CIA. Many things. I learned the way
they think."
609,WOMBOSI,609,"Was the bomb on my boat supposed to
go off or not?"
610,WOMBOSI,610,You didn't set the bomb. Why?
611,WOMBOSI,611,Was this a game or a fuck up?
612,BOURNE,612,I don't know.
613,WOMBOSI,613,Get the kids out!
614,WOMBOSI,614,And the door.
615,CONKLIN,615,-- code him again -- punch it in --
616,COM TECH #1,616,-- he's not responding --
617,CONKLIN,617,-- the paging unit must be damaged --
618,COM TECH #2,618,"-- we just ran a remote diagnostic,
sir, it's not the unit --"
619,ABBOTT,619,What are you doing?
620,CONKLIN,620,I'm going to Paris.
621,ABBOTT,621,"No you're not. You're not going
anywhere. I'm shutting this down."
622,CONKLIN,622,"You're not doing shit. You're so
scared you can't even think."
623,ABBOTT,623,"You just blew up a house in Paris!
This program is over. Call it off."
624,CONKLIN,624,"I can't call it off. He's not
responding. Get out of my way."
625,MARIE,625,"It doesn't matter who you were before.
It's who you want to be. That's all
that matters."
626,MARIE,626,"We have this money. We have what we
have. I had nothing before and now,
I don't know, maybe I have more,
maybe it's nothing, but..."
627,MARIE,627,"I say we leave here. We leave this
place. We go until we can't go
anymore."
628,BOURNE,628,You could do that?
629,MARIE,629,Yes. That's who I want to be.
630,CLERK,630,xxxxxx...
631,MARIE,631,xxxxxx
632,BOURNE,632,xxxxxx.
633,MARIE,633,xxxxxx
634,BOURNE,634,Stop where you are.
635,MARIE,635,What?
636,BOURNE,636,Where's the dog?
637,CLERK,637,My husband's out looking for him.
638,BOURNE,638,He run away often?
639,CLERK,639,"That old beast? Miss his breakfast?
Not a chance."
640,CLERK,640,"It's always something, right?"
641,BOURNE,641,Get in the basement.
642,CLERK,642,What?
643,BOURNE,643,Get everyone down in the basement.
644,CLERK,644,What the hell're you talking about?
645,BOURNE,645,"You're in danger. All of you. I have
no time to explain."
646,CLERK,646,Wait a minute --
647,BOURNE,647,I'm sorry.
648,MARIE,648,Jason...
649,MARIE,649,Who is it? Who's out there?
650,BOURNE,650,xxxxxx
651,MARIE,651,xxxxxx
652,BOURNE,652,I won't let that happen.
653,BOURNE,653,xxxxxx
654,MARIE,654,xxxxxx
655,BOURNE,655,Go!
656,MARIE,656,Did we lose them?
657,MARIE,657,Who is it?
658,BOURNE,658,We have to keep moving.
659,BOURNE,659,xxxxxx
660,MARIE,660,xxxxxx
661,MARIE,661,What are you doing?
662,MARIE,662,xxxxxx
663,BOURNE,663,xxxxxx
664,MARIE,664,Give me the gun --
665,BOURNE,665,Wait 'till he's close.
666,MARIE,666,xxxxxx
667,MARIE,667,xxxxxx
668,BOURNE,668,xxxxxx
669,MARIE,669,xxxxxx
670,BOURNE,670,xxxxxx
671,MARIE,671,xxxxxx
672,BOURNE,672,xxxxxx
673,BOURNE,673,Who else is coming?
674,BOURNE,674,I won't ask again.
675,PROFESSOR,675,I work alone. Like you...
676,PROFESSOR,676,...we always work alone.
677,BOURNE,677,What do you mean?
678,PROFESSOR,678,Who are you? Rome? Paris?
679,PROFESSOR,679,"Treadstone... both of us... I was
warned but..."
680,BOURNE,680,Treadstone?
681,PROFESSOR,681,...which one are you?...
682,BOURNE,682,Paris. I live in Paris...
683,PROFESSOR,683,"...headaches... you have that... I
get such bad headaches..."
684,BOURNE,684,Yes.
685,PROFESSOR,685,...it's a problem...
686,BOURNE,686,Treadstone.
687,PROFESSOR,687,"...or in a car... when it's dark...
something with the headlights..."
688,PROFESSOR,688,"...pills, right? Treadstone had those
pills..."
689,BOURNE,689,What is Treadstone?
690,PROFESSOR,690,"...what did you do?... you must've
really fucked up..."
691,BOURNE,691,I think so.
692,PROFESSOR,692,"...someone said caffeine -- for a
headache... doesn't seem..."
693,BOURNE,693,What do they want me to do?
694,PROFESSOR,694,...they won't let you go...
695,BOURNE,695,Why?
696,PROFESSOR,696,Look at this...
697,PROFESSOR,697,...least you have a woman....
698,MARIE,698,Jason...
699,MARIE,699,We've got to go.
700,BOURNE,700,Take this.
701,BOURNE,701,Take it.
702,MARIE,702,And that's it?
703,BOURNE,703,If you're lucky.
704,BOURNE,704,Take it.
705,BOURNE,705,"There's enough in there to make a
life. Any life. Just get out now.
Get low. Stay low."
706,BOURNE,706,Take it.
707,MARIE,707,"What was I thinking, right?"
708,BOURNE,708,I can't protect you anymore.
709,MARIE,709,What about you?
710,BOURNE,710,I'm gonna find the end of this.
711,BOURNE,711,I can't protect you.
712,BOURNE,712,What did you do to me?
713,CONKLIN,713,"What did I do? What've you done? Do
you have any idea? Any conception?
What you've destroyed? Do you have
any idea how much time and work --
how many people have their lives
wrapped up in this?"
714,BOURNE,714,Are you Treadstone?
715,CONKLIN,715,Am I Treadstone? Me?
716,CONKLIN,716,What the hell're you talking about?
717,BOURNE,717,What did you do to me?
718,CONKLIN,718,"What did I do? I spent thirty million
dollars on you. I spent three years
finding you -- four years training
you --"
719,CONKLIN,719,What did I do?
720,CONKLIN,720,"What in the name of God have you
been doing, Jason?"
721,BOURNE,721,I don't know.
722,CONKLIN,722,"They're right about you, aren't they?
You're fried."
723,CONKLIN,723,"You really don't know what's going
on, do you?"
724,BOURNE,724,"I know you've been trying to kill
me."
725,CONKLIN,725,"Of course. We had to try. We didn't
know what was wrong."
726,CONKLIN,726,We didn't know you were in trouble.
727,BOURNE,727,So now you know.
728,CONKLIN,728,So it's time to go home.
729,BOURNE,729,That's all I get?
730,CONKLIN,730,"We'll make you better. We can put
the pieces back. We can do that."
731,BOURNE,731,I don't think so.
732,CONKLIN,732,"We have to go home, Jason."
733,BOURNE,733,Jason Bourne is dead.
734,CONKLIN,734,There never was a Jason Bourne.
735,CONKLIN,735,"You have to come with me. It's the
only way. We can give it back to
you..."
736,BOURNE,736,Keep it.
737,CONKLIN,737,Jason...
738,CONKLIN,738,They can't let you go...
739,BOURNE,739,That'll be their second worst mistake.
740,ABBOTT (O.S.),740,"The Treadstone project has actually
already been terminated. It was
designed primarily as a sort of
advanced game program..."
741,ABBOTT,741,"...We'd hoped it might build into a
good training platform, but quite
honestly, for a strictly theoretical
exercise, we thought it was far too
expensive. The cost-benefit ratio
was just too high. It's been all but
decommissioned at this point."
742,MARSHALL,742,"All right, what's next?"
743,ABBOTT,743,"Okay, this is Blackbriar. Blackbriar
is a joint, DOD, communications
program that we really feel has good
traction to it."
744,MARIE,744,Can I help you?
745,BOURNE,745,This your store?
746,MARIE,746,Yes.
747,BOURNE,747,Think I could rent a scooter?
748,MARIE,748,You have ID?
749,BOURNE,749,Not really.
750,MARIE,750,It's not a problem.
