17,KING,17,"Don't matter, she knows what it means ... an she
don't read too good nohow ..."
18,LERNER,18,"Mumm, any time sweetheart."
19,ELIAS,19,"Lerner, you'd choke to death on it."
20,CAPTAIN HARRIS,20,"Sky Six reports a fresh company of NVA moving across
from Cambodia to this blue line."
21,CAPTAIN HARRIS,21,"We got a good chance to light 'em up tonight.  All
platoons will set squad-size ambushes before full
dark.  Lt. Wolfe"
22,CAPTAIN HARRIS,22,"You 'bush in this area near that ol' Buddhist temple
we passed on the hump in.  Lt. Hawkins, you take this

29,BIG HAROLD,29,"De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known

31,JUNIOR (CONT'D),31,"Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass

32,BIG HAROLD,32,"That reminds me, I gotta take a shit."
33,JUNIOR,33,You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
34,BIG HAROLD,34,Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
35,CHRIS,35,"Somebody once wrote Hell is the impossibility of
Reason.  That's what this place feels like.  I hate
it already and it's only been a week.  Some goddamn
week, grandma ..."
36,CHRIS,36,"... the hardest thing I think I've ever done is to go
on point, 3 times this week - I don't even know what
I'm doing.  A gook could be standing 3 feet in front
of me and I wouldn't know it, I'm so tired.  We get
up at 5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p.m.,
dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or
a 3-man listening post in the jungle.  It's scary
cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause I'm
new and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't
even want to know your name.  The unwritten rule is a
new guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't
put his time in yet - and they say if you're gonna
get killed in the Nam it's better to get it in the
first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer
that much.  I can believe that ... If you're lucky
you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then
you pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4
hours a night, but you don't really sleep ... I don't
think I can keep this up for a year, grandma - I
think I've made a big mistake coming here ..."
37,BARNES,37,"We got boo-coo movement.  3rd Battalion just got hit
15 kliks north of here."
38,O'NEILL,38,"Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew
a whole fucking platoon to pieces.  BAAD SHIT."
39,BARNES,39,"Yeah, they got two Lieutenants and a Captain."
40,WOLFE,40,Jesus.
41,WOLFE (CONT'D),41,"Who do you want on ambush, Sergeant?"
42,BARNES,42,"Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and
Francis from your squad."
43,BARNES,43,We move out in two-zero mikes.
44,ELIAS,44,I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
45,O'NEILL,45,"Shit!  Morehouse and Sal are short.  Fu Sheng's going
on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an
ambush.  You got the fresh meat Elias."
46,ELIAS,46,"They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna
run into something."
47,O'NEILL,47,"So what am I going to do!  Get one of my guys zapped
so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his
beauty fucking sleep!"
48,ELIAS,48,"Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to
be a prick everyday of your life, you know."
49,O'NEILL,49,Fuck you Elias.
50,BARNES,50,You get your men ready Elias ...
51,O'NEILL,51,"Fucking guy's got 3 years in and he thinks he's
Cochise or something ..."
52,O'NEILL,52,CUT TO:
53,TEX,53,"Shit, looks like rain.  All night too.  Gonna grow
mushrooms in your bad-ass crotch Junior."
54,JUNIOR,54,"Goddamn ain't no justice round here, you break your
ass for de white man ... gonna get our act together,
do some rappin' wid de brothers, change things ..."
55,CRAWFORD,55,"What's O'Neill have a nose up the lieutenant's ass
already, how come we always get ambush."
56,FRANCIS,56,"Politics, man, politics.  We always getting fucked
around here."
57,GARDNER,57,"Hey Chris, I show you a picture of Lucy Jean?"
58,CHRIS,58,No ...
59,GARDNER,59,"Yeah she's the one all right ... that's Lucy Jean.
She's a-waiting for me."
60,CHRIS,60,"Yeah she's real pretty, you're lucky ..."
61,ELIAS,61,"Don't need this or this ... you're doing okay.  Just
stick close to Tex, do what he does."
62,ELIAS,62,Tex you got Junior and Taylor here on your position.
63,TEX,63,"Damn, 'Lias this gun's boss.  Put Taylor someplace
else."
64,ELIAS,64,You got Taylor ...

66,ELIAS,66,"lost don't yell out okay.  Sit tight.  We'll get to

68,TEX,68,"Taylor, you're on."
69,CHRIS,69,Uh hunh.
70,TEX,70,You sure you know how to work the claymore?
71,CHRIS,71,Sure.
72,TEX,72,"Okay ... don't catch no zzz's on me buddy or I'll
sling your motherfucking ass ... You hear me?"
73,CHRIS,73,Yeah.
74,CHRIS,74,Hey Tex - you're ten minutes fast.
75,TEX,75,Sin Loi.
76,CHRIS,76,Junior!
77,JUNIOR,77,Unh? ... Unh.
78,CHRIS,78,Shaddup!  You're snoring ... Shhh.
79,CHRIS,79,CUT TO:
80,CHRIS (V.O.),80,"... 'Course Mom and Dad didn't want me to come, they
wanted me to be just like them - respectable, hard-
working, making $200 a week, a little house, a
family.  They drove me crazy with their goddamn
world, grandma, you know Mom, I don't want to be a
white boy on Wall Street, I don't want my whole life
to be predetermined by them."
81,CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D),81,"... I guess I have always been sheltered and special,
I just want to be anonymous.  Like everybody else.
Do my share for my country.  Live up to what Grandpa
did in the First War and Dad the Second.  I know this
is going to be the war of my generation.  Well here I
am - anonymous all right, with guys nobody really
cares about - they come from the end of the line,
most of 'em, small towns you never heard of -
Pulaski, Tennessee, Brandon, Mississippi, Pork Bend,
Utah, Wampum, Pennsylvania.  Two years' high school's
about it, maybe if they're lucky a job waiting for
'em back in a factory, but most of 'em got nothing,
they're poor, they're the unwanted of our society,
yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom
and what we call America, they're the bottom of the
barrel - and they know it, maybe that's why they call
themselves 'grunts' cause a 'grunt' can take it, can
take anything.  They're the backbone of this country,
grandma, the best I've ever seen, the heart and soul
- I've found it finally, way down here in the mud -
maybe from down here I can start up again and be
something I can be proud of, without having to fake
it, maybe ... I can see something I don't yet see,
learn something I don't yet know ... I miss you, I
miss you very much, tell Mom I miss her too - Chris."
82,CHRIS (CONT'D),82,Wake up!
83,CHRIS (CONT'D),83,"It's your shift, man ..."
84,TEX,84,THE CLAYMORE!  GET THOSE FUCKERS!

hardy  Deep inside I'm blue ..."
288,ALL,288,"'... Since you've left me, if you've seen me with
another girl seeming like I'm having fun although she

the permanent one ...'"
289,ALL (CONT'D),289,"'... So take a good look at my face.  You'll see the
smile looks out of place.  Look a little bit closer.
It's easy to trace.  The tracks of my tears...'"
290,CHRIS (V.O.),290,"New Year's Day, 1968.  Just another day.  Staying
alive.  There's been a lot of movement neat the
Cambodian border, regiments of NVA moving across.  A

309,CHRIS (V.O.),309,"We had to get to the village before dark so we left
Elias with some men to keep looking and to wait for
the engineers ... But it was King who found him ...
about 1000 yards downriver, not far from the village
- It was the end of the mystery."
310,CHRIS (V.O.),310,"... the village, which had stood for maybe a thousand
years, didn't know we were coming that day.  If they
had they would have run ... Barnes was at the eye of
our rage - and through him, our Captain Ahab - we
would set things right again.  That day we loved him"
311,BUNNY,311,"Hey pig, pig - come here, pig, pig."

343,LERNER,343,He says he was hit in a bombing raid.
344,TONY,344,He's a dink fosure.
345,BARNES,345,Ask him what the weapons are doing here?
346,LERNER,346,"He says they had no choice.  The NVA killed the old
honcho when he said no.  He says the rice is theirs."
347,BARNES,347,"Bullshit ... who the hell was the dink we just nailed
on the riverbank?"
348,LERNER,348,"... He says he doesn't know, NVA haven't been around
in a couple of months.  Maybe it was a scout or ..."
349,BARNES,349,"Yeah sure it was.  What about all that fucking rice
and the weapons ... who they for?"
350,BARNES,350,Cocksucker knows what I'm saying ... don't you Pop?
351,ACE,351,You're goddamn right he does!

the pigs, they're farmers ... they got to make a
living, all that crap ..."
357,BARNES,357,Tell him he talks or I'm gonna waste more of 'em.

359,LERNER,359,"They don't know Sarge, they don't know!"
360,ACE,360,Hey Sarge can we get in on this.

394,BARNES,394,"You got it sir - and I can throw in plenty of eye-
witnesses if you want sir ..."
395,HARRIS,395,"Not now.  We'll get into this when we get back to
base camp.  Right now I need every man in the field,
I want your guys to stick together ... Elias?
Barnes? ... You hear me?  This is no time for
fighting with each other."
396,HARRIS,396,"Tomorrow we're going back into that bunker complex -
from the East."
397,HARRIS,397,"First Platoon will lead ... Brigade thinks they might
be back there tomorrow.  That's all ... Get some
rest."
398,WOLFE,398,"Don't worry about it Sergeant, he won't be able to
prove a thing, he's a troublemaker but ..."
399,BARNES,399,"Elias' a waterwalker ... like them politicians in
Washington.  Want to fight their war with one hand
tied round their balls.  Ain't no time or need for a
courtroom out here ..."
400,O'NEILL,400,How'd it go.

405,KING,405,"Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking ..."
406,CHRIS,406,Where's he form?
407,RHAH,407,Barnes comes from Hell.
408,LERNER,408,Tennessee someplace.  Hill country.
409,RHAH,409,Barnes took a bullet right there.  At Ia Drang Valley
410,RHAH,410,"And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man.
That's his high, baby.  High on WAR!"
411,KING,411,"He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he

416,LERNER,416,Does a pee wee wanna take a wee wee?
417,RHAH,417,The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
418,KING,418,"Yeah, you done said it.  Revenge on US."
419,CHRIS,419,Does he have a metal plate in his head?
420,RHAH,420,"You mean he's crazy?  No more crazy'n the rest of us

422,RHAH,422,That's what he is ... Baaaa!
423,RHAH (CONT'D),423,"... and he's FILLED with it.  He's roaming these

Remember the Devil does God's work too."
424,RHAH (CONT'D),424,... and this here's Elias ... Baaaa!
425,KING,425,"Love, yeah!"
426,LERNER,426,"Here we go again with the crazy preacher stuff.  Rhah

427,RHAH,427,"Baaa, got no time to go to the movies.  Love and Hate
too busy fighting for possession of my soul."
428,CHRIS,428,Where's Elias come from?
429,RHAH,429,'Lias come naturally.
430,LERNER,430,"... don't know.  Done some time.  Heard he worked the
oil wells in Oklahoma, made some bread and washed up
in El Lay."
431,KING,431,"Yeah, get married to some crazy El Lay bitch, an
actress or somethin', she blew all his bread - LSD,
gurus, all that California shit, and then she turns
him into the cops on a drug rap."
432,RHAH,432,Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
433,KING,433,"So he got a reduced and come over here.  Nam's his
freedom man, Nam's his pussy.  Three years he been
here."
434,CHRIS,434,"Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes ..."
435,KING,435,"Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back.  How you
gonna talk to civilians man?  People back in the
world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to
them you're a fuckin' animal is all -"
436,LERNER,436,"I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just
worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for
themselves, they don't even want to talk about it
man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there -
you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here.  My
sister says to me why you have to go there like I
started this ..."
437,RHAH,437,"Baaaa!  Fuck it, they sold us out - so what!  What'd
you'all expect?  Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT
man.  They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television
and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody
dies.  That's all right, you keep fuckin' up,
politicians keep lyin'.  Cause it don't really
matter.  Don't mean shit.  So what!  Whatcha want - a
parade!  Fuck that too!  No war time no grunt never
got no respect.  Till he was dead - and even THEN!
You're fighting for YOURSELF man!  You're fighting
for your SOUL, dat's all.  Remember dat.  And it's
some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle
with that angel ..."
438,RHAH,438,"... Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's
the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna
change ..."
439,CHRIS,439,"... I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time."
440,ELIAS,440,... don't feel like it either.
441,CHRIS,441,... beautiful night.
442,ELIAS,442,"Yeah.  I love this place at night.  The stars ...
there's no right or wrong in them, they're just
there."
443,CHRIS,443,That's a nice way of putting it.
444,CHRIS (CONT'D),444,"Barnes got it in for you, don't he?"
445,ELIAS,445,Barnes believes in what he's doing.
446,CHRIS,446,"And you, do you believe?"
447,ELIAS,447,In '65 - yeah.  Now ...
448,ELIAS,448,"No.  What happened today's just the beginning.  We're
gonna lose this war ..."
449,CHRIS,449,You really think so ... us?
450,ELIAS,450,"... we been kicking other people's asses so long I
guess it's time we got our own kicked.  The only
decent thing I can see coming out of here are the
survivors - hundreds of thousands of guys like you
Taylor going back to every little town in the country
knowing something about what it's like to take a life
and what that can do to a person's soul - twist it
like Barnes and Bunny and make 'em sick inside and if
you got any brains you gonna fight it the rest of
your life cause it's cheap, killing is cheap, the
cheapest thing I know and when some drunk like
O'Neill starts glorifying it, you're gonna puke all
over him and when the politicians start selling you a
used war all over again, you and your generation
gonna say go fuck yourself 'cause you know, you've
seen it, and when you know it, deep down there ..."
451,ELIAS (CONT'D),451,"... you know it till you die ... that's why the
survivors remember.  'Cause the dead don't let em
forget."
452,ELIAS (CONT'D),452,"Oh shit!  Sometimes there's things in my head ...
man.  Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a
crazy Indian ..."
453,CHRIS,453,"Do you believe that stuff about ... knowing you're
gonna die?"
454,ELIAS,454,"Yeah, those are the guys that live.  I really don't
think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage
can, I think it takes whatever it can get ... you
never know where it's gonna come from anyway ... so
why spin your wheels?"
455,CHRIS,455,"... You ever think about reincarnation, all that
stuff?"
456,ELIAS,456,"Sure, goes on all the time.  Maybe a piece of me's in
you now, who knows.  But when you die - really die -
that's a big return ticket."
457,ELIAS,457,"I like to think I'm gonna come back as ... as wind or
fire - or a deer"
458,ELIAS,458,"... yeah, a deer ..."
459,HAROLD,459,"Shit, lookit this little fucker trying to get up ma

465,BIG HAROLD,465,"Dat's okay wid me, better to have a small one den no

466,KING,466,"Your girlfriends gonna look for new lovers, man.
Best thing a bro's got's his flap."
467,HAROLD,467,"I'll drink to your flap in Chicago, King.  All I
gotta do is stretch it out to 15 days and I'll be
short 15 and the Beast just wouldn't dare send me
back to the bush."
468,FRANCIS,468,"You gonna get some for me back in the World, Harold?
Whatcha gonna do?"
469,HAROLD,469,"The world's gonna be ma oyster man.  First's I gonna

597,CHRIS (V.O.),597,"They sent us back into the valley the next day -
about 2,000 metres from Cambodia - into a battalion
perimeter.  Alpha Company had been hit hard the day
before by a sizeable force and Charlie Company had
been probed that night.  There were other battalions
in the valley, we weren't the only ones but we knew
we were going to be the bait to lure them out.  And
somewhere out there was the entire 141st NVA
Regiment."
598,ACE,598,"... they caught 'em last night pulling some shit on
Charlie Company.  They found maps on 'em, man - got a
friend at Battalion says they had every fuckin'

607,RHAH,607,"Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far
enuff apart you could run a regiment through there
and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left"
608,WOLFE,608,"I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson.  You'll
get new men any day.  Time being you make do like

753,CHRIS (V.O.),753,"I think now, looking back, we did not fight the
enemy, we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us
... The war is over for me now, but it will always be
there - the rest of my days.  As I am sure Elias will
be - fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called
possession of my soul ... There are times since I
have felt like the child born of those two fathers
... but be that as it may, those of us who did make
it have an obligation to build again, to teach to
others what we know and to try with what's left of
our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life"
