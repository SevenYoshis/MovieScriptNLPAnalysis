0,VOICE (O.S.),0,"One two, Freddie's coming for
you..."
1,WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.),1,"You okay, Tina?"
2,TINA,2,"Just a dream, Ma..."
3,TINA,3,"Damn dream, is all..."
4,TINA'S MOTHER,4,"Some dream, judging from that."
5,MAN (OS),5,"You coming back to the sack or
what?"
6,TINA'S MOTHER,6,Hold your horses.
7,TINA'S MOTHER,7,"You gotta cut your nails or stop
that kind of dreaming, Tina.  One
or the other."
8,TINA,8,"Oh, shit."
9,CHILDREN (OS),9,"One two, Freddie's coming for you...
Three four better lock your door
Five six grab your crucifix..."
10,ROPE JUMPERS,10,"Seven eight, gonna stay up late!
Nine ten -- never sleep again!"
11,TINA,11,"That's what it reminded me of --
that old jump rope song."
12,TINA,12,"Worst nightmare I ever had.
You wouldn't believe it."
13,NANCY,13,"Matter of fact I had a bad dream
last night myself..."
14,ROD,14,"Had a hardon this morning when
I woke up, Tina.  Had your name
written all over it."
15,TINA,15,"There's four letters in my name,
Rod.  How could there be room
on your joint for four letters?"
16,ROD,16,"Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn
mower!"
17,TINA,17,Rod says the sweetest things.
18,NANCY,18,He's nuts about you.
19,TINA,19,"Yeah, nuts."
20,TINA (CONTD),20,"Anyway, I'm too tired to worry
about the creep.  Couldn't get
back to sleep at all."
21,TINA (CONTD),21,So what you dream?
22,NANCY,22,"Forget it, the point is,"
23,NANCY,23,"body has nightmares once in a while.
No biggy."
24,GLEN,24,"Next time you have one, just
tell yourself that's just all
it is, right while you're having
it, y'know?  That's the trick.
Once you do that, you wake right
up.  At least it works for me."
25,TINA,25,Hey!  You have a nightmare too?
26,TINA (CONTD),26,"Maybe we're gonna have the Big
Earthquake.  They say things get
weird just before that..."
27,TINA,27,"I can't believe his mother let him
come over here."
28,NANCY,28,"Right.  Well, she didn't, exactly..."
29,GLEN,29,"See, I got this cousin who lives
near the airport, that it's okay
for me to stay with, right?  So I
found this sound effects tape at
Licorice Pizza, and..."
30,GLEN (CONTD),30,"Hello, Mom?"
31,GLEN (CONTD),31,"Yeah, out here at Barry's."
32,GLEN (CONT),32,"Huh?  Yeah, noisy as usual.  Glad
we don't live here -- huh?  Yeah,
Aunt Eunice says hello."
33,GLEN (CONT),33,"Right, right -- I'll call you in the
morning!  Right!  Huh?  Yeah, sure,
I, huh?..."
34,GLEN (CONT),34,"Uh... some kid's drag racing
outside, I think..."
35,GLEN (CONT),35,"Listen, Mom, I got to go -- I
think there's been an accident out
front -- I --"
36,GLEN (CONT),36,"Right.  I'll call the police.  No,
just some neighbors having a fight,
I guess.  I'm fine, I'm fine!
Call you in the morning!"
37,NANCY,37,Worked like a charm.
38,GLEN,38,Jesus.
39,NANCY,39,Nice to have a fire.
40,TINA,40,Really.  Turn 'er up a little.
41,NANCY,41,"Maybe we should call Rod, have him
come over too.  He might get jealous."
42,TINA,42,"Rod and I are done.  He's too much
of a maniac."
43,GLEN,43,"He should join the Marines, they
could make something out of him.
Like a hand grenade."
44,NANCY,44,"See?  You've forgotten the bad
dream.  Didn't I tell you?"
45,TINA,45,"All day long I been seeing that
guy's weird face, and hearing
those fingernails..."
46,NANCY,46,Fingernails?
47,NANCY,47,"That's amazing, you saying that.
It made me remember the dream I
had last night."
48,TINA,48,What you dream?
49,NANCY,49,"I dreamed about this guy in a
dirty red and yellow sweater;
I dream in color, y'know; he
walked into the room I was in,
right, right through the wall,
like it was smoke or something,
and just stared at me.  Sort of
...obscenely.  Then he walked
out through the wall on the
other side.  Like he'd just
come to check me out..."
50,TINA,50,So what about the fingernails?
51,NANCY,51,"He scraped his fingernails
along things -- actually, they
were more like fingerknives or
something, like he'd made them
himself?  Anyway, they made
this horrible nose --"
52,TINA,52,"Nancy.  You dreamed about the
same creep I did, Nancy..."
53,GLEN,53,That's impossible.
54,TINA,54,What?
55,GLEN,55,Nothing.
56,TINA,56,"There's somebody out there,"
57,NANCY,57,I didn't hear anything...
58,GLEN,58,"I'm gonna punch out your ugly
lights, whoever you are."
59,GLEN,59,It's just a stupid cat.
60,NANCY,60,"Then bring us back its tail
and whiskers."
61,TINA,61,"Anyway, I don't have a cat..."
62,GLEN,62,Kitty-kitty?  Chow chow chow?
63,ROD,63,"And it's number thirty-six, Rod
Lane, bringing Lantz down just
three yards from the goal with a
brilliant tackle!  And the fans
go wild!"
64,TINA,64,What the hell you doing here?
65,ROD,65,"Came to make up, no big deal.
Your ma home?"
66,TINA,66,Of course.  What's that?
67,ROD,67,"Intense, huh?"
68,ROD,68,"So what's happening, an orgy or
something?"
69,GLEN,69,"Maybe a funeral, you dickhead."
70,NANCY,70,"-- Just a sleep-over date, Rod.
Just Tina and me.  Glen was just
leaving."
71,ROD,71,You see his face?
72,ROD,72,"Your ma ain't home,"
73,ROD,73,Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.
74,NANCY,74,Rod...
75,ROD,75,"We got her mother's bed.
You two got the rest."
76,NANCY,76,We should get her out of here...
77,TINA,77,"Hey -- you guys're hanging around --
right?"
78,TINA,78,"Don't leave me alone with this
lunatic -- Pleeeeze, NANCY!"
79,GLEN,79,"So we'll guard her together.
Through the night."
80,GLEN,80,"In each others' arms like
we always said."
81,NANCY,81,"Glen.  Not now.  I mean,
we're here for Tina now,
not for ourselves."
82,GLEN,82,"Why's she so bothered by a
stupid nightmare, anyway?"
83,NANCY,83,"Because he was scary, that's
why."
84,GLEN,84,Who was scary?
85,NANCY,85,"Don't you think it's weird, her
and me dreaming about the same
guy?"
86,NANCY,86,"You didn't have a bad dream
last night, did you?"
87,GLEN,87,Me?  I don't dream.
88,GLEN,88,Morality sucks.
89,TINA,89,"I knew there was sometihng
about you I liked..."
90,ROD,90,"You feel better now, right?"
91,TINA,91,Jungle man fix Jane.
92,ROD,92,No more fights?
93,TINA,93,No more fights.
94,ROD,94,"Good.  No more nightmares for
either of us then."
95,TINA,95,When did you have a nightmare?
96,ROD,96,"Guys can have nightmares too,
y'know.  You ain't got a corner
on the fucking market or something."
97,TINA,97,"Where'd you get this snotty old
thing?"
98,TINA,98,ROD...
99,TINA,99,"Who the fuck you think you are,
whoever you are?"
100,TINA,100,Somebody there?
101,VOICE,101,Tina.
102,TINA,102,Who the hell
103,TINA,103,"Oh, shit, please God..."
104,TINA,104,Nancy!  Open the door -- Nancy!
105,MAN,105,"She's still awake.  Nancy can't
hear you."
106,ROD,106,T-tina!?
107,ROD,107,"What the hell's going ON here!
Tina!"
108,ROD,108,Tina --
109,ROD,109,for that!
110,GLEN,110,What the hell's going on!?
111,NANCY,111,"Oh -- jeez -- Glen!  Rod's
gone ape!"
112,ROD (OS),112,I'll kill you!
113,GLEN,113,Rod?
114,GLEN,114,"Rod, you better not hurt Tina..."
115,GLEN,115,You okay?
116,NANCY,116,"Yeah.  Something slippering all
over here..."
117,NANCY,117,Tina?
118,GLEN,118,"Oh, shit..."
119,GLEN (CONTD),119,I...I'm gonna call the cops --
120,PARKER,120,"Lieutenant Thompson.  Sorry to
wake you, but --"
121,LT THOMPSON,121,"I'd've canned your ass if you
hadn't.  What you got?"
122,PARKER,122,"Her name was Tina Gray.  It
was her home.  Father abandoned
ten years ago, mother's in
Vegas with a boyfriend.  We're
trying to reach her now."
123,LT THOMPSON,123,What's the Coroner got to say?
124,PARKER,124,"Something like a razor was
the weapon, but nothing
found on the scene."
125,SERGEANT GARCIA,125,Leautenant.  You know who --
126,LT THOMPSON,126,Where is she?
127,SERGEANT GARCIA,127,I put her in your office...
128,PARKER,128,"Looks like her boyfriend did
it.  Rod Lane.  Musician type,
arrests for brawling, dope --"
129,LT THOMPSON,129,"Terrific.  What the hell was
she doing there?"
130,PARKER,130,She lived there.
131,LT THOMPSON (CONTD),131,I mean you.
132,LT THOMPSON (CONTD),132,What the hell was she doing there?
133,MARGE,133,"Hello to you, too, Donald."
134,LT THOMPSON,134,Marge.
135,LT THOMPSON (CONTD),135,"How you doing, pal?"
136,NANCY,136,"Okay.  Hi, dad."
137,LT THOMPSON,137,"I don't want to get into this now,
god knows you need time."
138,LT THOMPSON,138,"But I'd sure would like to know
what the hell you were doing
shacked up with three other kids
in the middle of the night --
especially a delinquent lunatic
like Lane."
139,NANCY,139,Rod's not a lunatic.
140,LT THOMPSON,140,"You got a sane explanation for
what he did?"
141,MARGE,141,"Apparantly he was crazy jealous.
Nancy said they'd had a fight,
Rod and Tina."
142,NANCY,142,It wasn't that serious...
143,MARGE,143,Maybe
144,MARGE,144,serious --
145,NANCY,145,"She was my best friend!  Don't
you dare say I don't take her
death seriously!"
146,NANCY,146,"I just meant their fights
weren't that serious."
147,NANCY (CONTD),147,She dreamed this would happen...
148,LT THOMPSON,148,What?
149,NANCY,149,"She had a nightmare about somebody
trying to kill her, last night.
That's why we were there; she was
afraid to sleep alone."
150,MARGE,150,"She's been through enough for one
night.  You have her statement."
151,LT THOMPSON,151,"I suggest you keep a little better
track on her -- she's still a kid,
y'know."
152,MARGE,152,"You think I knew there were boys
there!?"
153,MARGE,153,teenager alone.
154,LT THOMPSON,154,See they get home okay.
155,TV NEWSCASTER (OS/FILTER),155,"In the headlines this morning --
a local teenage girl was brutally
murdered during an all-night party."
156,TV NEWSCASTER (CONTD),156,"Police say the victim, fifteen-year
-old Christina Grey, had quarrelled
earlier with her boyfriend, Rod
Lane, a punk rocker with a history
of delinquency.  Lane is now the
subject of a city-wide manhunt.
According to --"
157,MARGE,157,Where you think you're going?
158,NANCY,158,School.
159,MARGE,159,"I could hear you tossing and
turning all night, kiddo.  You've
no business going to school."
160,NANCY,160,"I gotta go to school, Mom.
Please.  Otherwise I'll just
sit up there and go crazy
or something."
161,NANCY,161,"I'll sleep in study hall, promise.
I'd rather keep busy, you know?"
162,MARGE,162,Right home after.
163,NANCY (cont'd),163,Right home after.  See you.
164,ROD,164,I'm not gonna hurt you.
165,ROD,165,"Your old man thinks I did it,
don't he?"
166,NANCY,166,He doesn't know you.
167,NANCY,167,Couldn't you change?
168,ROD,168,The cops were all over my house.
169,ROD,169,They'll kill me for sure.
170,NANCY,170,Nobody's gonna kill you.
171,ROD,171,I never touched her.
172,NANCY,172,You were screaming like crazy.
173,ROD,173,Someone else was there.
174,NANCY,174,"The door was locked from your
side."
175,ROD,175,"Don't look at me like I'm some
kind of fucking fruitcake or
something, I'm warning you."
176,VOICE (O.S.),176,"Morning, Mr. Lane."
177,LT THOMPSON,177,"Now just step away from her, son.
Like your ass depended on it.
I'm warning"
178,NANCY,178,No!
179,THOMPSON,179,Jesus -- are you crazy!?
180,ROD (O.S.),180,I didn't do it -- !
181,ROD (O.S.),181,"I didn't kill her, Nancy!"
182,NANCY,182,"You used me, daddy!"
183,LT THOMPSON,183,"What the hell you doing going to
school today, anyway -- your
mother told me you didn't even
sleep last night!"
184,LT THOMPSON,184,Nancy!  Hey!
185,TEACHER,185,"According to Shakespeare, there
was something operating in Nature,
perhaps inside human nature itself,
that was rotten -- a canker, as
he put it."
186,TEACHER (CONTD),186,"Of course Hamlet's response to
this, and to his mother's lies,
was to continually probe and
dig -- just like the gravediggers --
always trying to get beneath the
surface.  The same was true in a
different way in Julius Caesar.
Jon, go ahead..."
187,SURFER,187,"Uh, In the most high and palmy
state of Rome..."
188,WISEGUY STUDENT (O.S.),188,"California's the most high and
palmy state, man."
189,ENGLISH TEACHER,189,Can it.
190,SURFER (O.S.),190,"In the most high and palmy state
of Rome, a little ere the mightiest
Julius fell..."
191,SURFER (O.S.),191,"The graves stood tenantless, and
the sheeted dead did squeak and
gibber in the Roman street..."
192,TINA (O.S.),192,Nancy.
193,SURFER,193,"O God, I could be bounded in a
nutshell and count myself a king
of infinite space, were it not
that I have bad dreams..."
194,TINA (O.S.),194,Nancy.
195,NANCY,195,Tina!
196,HALLGUARD,196,"Y-you're not supposed to run.
W-where's your pass -- you got a
pass?"
197,NANCY,197,Screw your stupid pass!
198,HALLGUARD,198,"Hey, no running in the halls!"
199,NANCY,199,Tina?
200,NANCY,200,Who
201,MAN,201,Gonna get you.
202,TEACHER,202,"Okay -- Okay, Thompson!  Every-
thing's all right now -- Nancy!."
203,TEACHER,203,I'll call your mother.
204,NANCY,204,"No!  No, really, I'm fine.  I'll go
straight home.  I'm okay."
205,TEACHER,205,You'll need a hall pass!
206,TINA,206,"Couldn't get back to sleep
at all."
207,TINA,207,What
208,NANCY,208,My dad here?
209,SERGEANT GARCIA,209,Lieutenant.
210,LT THOMPSON,210,"Decide to take a day off after
all?"
211,NANCY,211,"Dad, I want to see Rod Lane."
212,LT THOMPSON,212,"Only family allowed, Nancy.  You
know the drill."
213,NANCY,213,Just want to talk to him a second.
214,LT THOMPSON,214,He's dangerous.
215,NANCY,215,You don't know he did it.
216,LT THOMPSON,216,"No, I know, thanks to your
own testimony, that he was
locked in a room with a girl
who went in alive and came
out in a rubber bag."
217,NANCY,217,I just want to talk to him.
218,NANCY,218,"Please, Dad."
219,LT THOMPSON,219,Make it fast.
220,NANCY,220,And then what happened?
221,ROD,221,I told you.
222,ROD,222,"It was dark, but I'm sure there
was someone else IN there, under
the covers with her."
223,NANCY,223,"How could somebody get under
the covers with you guys
without you knowing it?"
224,ROD,224,How the fuck do I know?
225,ROD,225,"I don't expect you to believe
me."
226,NANCY,226,"What he look like?  You get
a look at him?"
227,ROD,227,No.
228,NANCY,228,"Well then how can you say
somebody else was there?"
229,ROD,229,"Because somebody cut her.  While
I watched."
230,NANCY,230,"Somebody cut her while you watched
and you don't know what he looked
like?"
231,ROD,231,You couldn't
232,ROD,232,"You could just see the cuts
happening, all at once."
233,NANCY,233,What you mean 'all at once'?
234,ROD,234,"I mean, it was as if there were
four razors cutting her at the
same time.  But invisible razors.
She just... opened up..."
235,NANCY,235,Rod!
236,ROD,236,"I probably could've saved her
if I'd moved sooner...  But I
thought it was just another
nightmare, like the one I had
the night before."
237,ROD,237,"There... was this guy who had
knives for fingers..."
238,ROD (CONTD),238,Do you think I did it?
239,NANCY,239,No.
240,MARGE,240,"Nancy, don't fall asleep in
there."
241,NANCY (OS),241,I won't.
242,MARGE,242,Get into bed.
243,NANCY,243,I will.
244,MARGE (OS/APPROACHING),244,Nancy?
245,NANCY,245,What?
246,MARGE (OS),246,"You're not falling asleep,
are you?  You could drown,
you know."
247,NANCY,247,"Mother, for petesakes."
248,MARGE (OS),248,It happens all the time.
249,MARGE (OS),249,"I've got some warm milk all
ready for you.  Why don't you
jump into bed?"
250,MARGE (OS),250,"I'm gonna turn on your electric
blanket, too.  C'mon, now."
251,NANCY,251,Warm milk.  Gross.
252,NANCY (CONTD),252,"One, two, Freddie's coming for
you, three four, better lock
your door, five six, grab your
crucifix, seven eight gonna
stay up late, nine ten, never
sleep again..."
253,MARGE,253,Nancy!  NANCY!
254,NANCY,254,Mommy!
255,MARGE,255,"I told you!  Hundreds of people
a year drown like that!"
256,MARGE,256,You okay?
257,NANCY,257,Great
258,MARGE,258,"To bed with you, c'mon."
259,MARGE,259,"No television, forget the
homework, no phone calls."
260,NANCY,260,"No, Mother.  Yes, Mother.
No, Mother."
261,MARGE,261,"And no school tomorrow, either.
you take a little vacation, relax
and rest for a change."
262,NANCY,262,"Yes, Mother.  G'night."
263,MARGE,263,"Take this, it'll help you sleep."
264,NANCY,264,Right.
265,MARGE,265,"Sleep tight, don't let the
bedbugs bite."
266,GLEN,266,"Sorry!  Saw your light on.
Thought I'd see how you were."
267,NANCY,267,"Sometimes I wish you didn't live
right across the street."
268,GLEN,268,"Shut up and let me in.  You ever
stand on a rose trellis in your
bare feet?"
269,NANCY,269,If you don't mind.
270,GLEN,270,"So.  I heard you freaked out
in English class today."
271,NANCY,271,Guess I did.
272,GLEN,272,"Haven't slept, have you?"
273,NANCY,273,Not really.
274,GLEN,274,"You look dead and rained on, if
you want the ugly truth.  And
what you do to your arm?"
275,NANCY,275,Burned myself in Englsh class.
276,NANCY,276,"M'god, I look twenty years old."
277,NANCY,277,"You have any weird dreams last
night?"
278,GLEN,278,Slept like a rock.
279,NANCY,279,"Well at least I have an objective
wall to bounce this off."
280,NANCY,280,"You believe it's possible to dream
about what's going to happen?"
281,GLEN,281,No.
282,NANCY,282,You believe in the Boogey Man?
283,GLEN,283,"One two, Freddie's coming
for you?  No.  Rod killed Tina.
he's a fruitcake and you know it."
284,NANCY,284,You believe in anything?
285,GLEN,285,"I believe in you, me, and
Rock and Roll.  And I'm not
too sure about you lately."
286,NANCY,286,"Listen, I got a crazy favor
to ask."
287,GLEN,287,Uh-oh...
288,NANCY,288,It's nothing too hard or anything.
289,NANCY,289,"I'm just going to... LOOK
for someone, and... I want
you to be sort of a ...guard.
Okay?"
290,NANCY,290,Okay?
291,GLEN,291,"Okay, okay."
292,GLEN,292,I think.
293,NANCY,293,"You won't screw up, right?  I
mean, a whole lot might depend
on it."
294,GLEN,294,"Okay, I won't screw up."
295,GLEN (IN DARK),295,"Jesus, it's dark in here."
296,NANCY,296,"Shhh.  Now listen, here's what
we're gonna do..."
297,NANCY,297,You still there?
298,GLEN,298,Yeah.  So?
299,NANCY,299,"Just checking -- keep out of
sight!"
300,NANCY (CONTD),300,Still there?
301,GLEN'S VOICE (OS),301,Still here!
302,NANCY,302,"On your toes, right?"
303,NANCY (CONTD),303,Glen.

305,NANCY (CONTD),305,Rod!  Look out!
306,NANCY,306,Glen!!
307,NANCY,307,I swear...
308,NANCY,308,"Glen, where are you!  Wake up!

312,NANCY,312,"Glen, you bastard..."
313,GLEN,313,What I do?
314,NANCY,314,"I asked you to do just one thing.
Just stay awake and watch me --
Just wake me if it looked like
I was having a bad dream."
315,NANCY,315,"But you.  You shit -- what do
you do -- you fall asleep!"
316,NANCY (CONTD),316,I must be going nuts...
317,MARGE (OS),317,Nancy?
318,GLEN,318,"Oh, shit."
319,NANCY,319,"Yes, mother?"
320,MARGE,320,You okay?
321,NANCY,321,"Yeah.  Just had a little dream.
I'm falling right back to sleep."
322,MARGE,322,"Okay... You need anything, just call."
323,NANCY,323,Okay.
324,GLEN,324,"You mind telling me what's
going on?"
325,GLEN (CONTD),325,"Oh, I see.  That makes it all
perfectly clear."
326,NANCY,326,"Garcia, I want to see Rod
Lane again."
327,SGT GARCIA,327,"I thought when I took the
night shift I'd have peace
and quiet for a change."
328,NANCY,328,"It's urgent, we've gotta see Rod."
329,SGT GARCIA,329,"It's three in the morning.
Your mother know you're out this
late?"
330,NANCY,330,"Of course -- look, at least go
back and"
331,NANCY,331,if he's okay.
332,GLEN,332,"We have reason to think there
might be something weird going
on."
333,LT THOMPSON (OS),333,"Oh, no argument on that."
334,NANCY,334,Dad -- what you doing here?
335,LT THOMPSON,335,"It so happens I work here, and
there's an unsolved murder.  I
don't like unsolved murders,
especially ones my daughter's
mixed up in -- what are"
336,LT THOMPSON,336,"doing here at this hour?  You're
supposed to be getting some
sleep."
337,GLEN,337,"Listen, sir, this is serious.
Nancy had a nightmare about Rod
being in danger, or something,
and so she thinks..."
338,NANCY,338,I just want to see if he's okay!
339,SGT GARCIA,339,"Take my word for it, Nancy.  The
guy's sleeping like a baby.  He's
not going anywhere."
340,NANCY,340,"This isn't your average nightmare,
Daddy -- damn it!"
341,LT THOMPSON,341,Now
342,LT THOMPSON,342,"it.  You've already rubbed my nose
in sex, drugs and violence -- don't
start throwing in insanity!"
343,NANCY,343,Just go back and check --
344,LT THOMPSON,344,"Okay, Garcia.  What the hell."
345,SGT GARCIA,345,Right...
346,SGT GARCIA,346,Now where'd I put the key...
347,NANCY,347,Rod!
348,LT THOMPSON,348,"Gimme a hand, dammit!"
349,SGT GARCIA,349,"Goddamn loco kid -- he didn't
have t'do that -- Madre dios!"
350,LT THOMPSON,350,"How'd you know he was gonna do
this?"
351,MINISTER,351,"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
May God be with this young man's
soul."
352,MINISTER (CONTD OS),352,"His life and his death attest to
the Scripture's warning that he who
lives by the sword shall die by
the sword."
353,MINISTER (CONTD OS),353,"But let us recall also our Lord's
admonition that we 'Judge not,
lest we be judged.'  Let us
attempt only to love.  And may
Rod Lane rest in peace."
354,NANCY,354,Amen to that much.
355,LT THOMPSON,355,How's Nancy doing?
356,MARGE,356,"I don't think she's slept since
Tina died."
357,MARGE,357,"She's always been a delicate
kid."
358,LT THOMPSON,358,"She's tougher than you think.
Any idea how she knew Rod was
gonna kill himself?"
359,MARGE,359,"No.  All I know is, this reminds
me too much of ten years ago."
360,LT THOMPSON,360,"Yeah.  Well... Let's not start
digging up bodies just because
we're in a cemetery."
361,MARGE,361,"Time to go home, baby."
362,NANCY,362,"The killer's still loose,
you know."
363,LT THOMPSON,363,"You saying somebody else killed
Tina?  Who?"
364,NANCY,364,"I don't know who he is.  But he's
burned, he wears a weird hat, a
red and yellow sweater, real
dirty, and he uses some sort of
knifes he's got made into a sort
of... glove.  Like giant finger-
nails."
365,LT THOMPSON,365,"I think you should keep Nancy
at home a few days.  'Til she's
really over the shock."
366,MARGE,366,I got something better...
367,MARGE,367,"I'm gonna get you help, baby.
So no one will threaten you
any more."
368,NANCY,368,But I just don't feel...
369,NANCY,369,"to sleep yet.  Please, do I
have to?"
370,DR KING,370,"Don't worry, you're not gonna
change into Bride of Frankenstein
or anything."
371,DR KING (CONTD),371,"Nancy have any severe childhood
illnesses?  Scarlet Fever?
High temperatures -- concussions?"
372,MARGE,372,"No, nothing."
373,NANCY,373,"He means, did you ever drop me
on my head."
374,DR KING,374,"Nightmares are expected after
psychological trauma.  Don't
worry, they go away."
375,MARGE,375,I sure as hell hope so.
376,NANCY,376,"I don't see why you couldn't
just give me a pill to keep me
from dreaming..."
377,DR KING,377,Everyone's
378,DR KING,378,"If you don't dream, you go..."
379,DR KING,379,All set?
380,NANCY,380,No.
381,MARGE,381,"They're just simple tests,
Nan.  We'll both be right
here."
382,DR KING,382,"Look, I know it's been fright-
ening, I know your dreams have
seemed real.  But... it's
okay.  Okay?"
383,MARGE,383,"Please, Nancy.  Trust us."
384,NANCY,384,"It's not you I don't trust.
It's..."
385,NANCY,385,Okay.  Let's do it.
386,DR KING,386,How long's this been going on?
387,MARGE,387,"Since the murder.  She was fine
before that."
388,DR KING,388,"Not to worry.  No signs of path-
ology in Nancy's EEG or pulse
rate.  I'd guess what we've got
is a normal young girl who just
happens to have gone through
two days of hell."
389,MARGE,389,"It's just made her think...
her dreams are real..."
390,DR KING,390,"Ever hear the old Buddhist tale
about the King who dreamed he
was a beggar who dreamed he
was a king?"
391,DR KING (CONTD),391,"Okay, good.  She's asleep."
392,MARGE,392,Thank God.
393,MARGE,393,"What the hell are dreams, anyway?"
394,DR KING,394,"Mysteries.  Incredible body
hookus pokus.  Truth is we
still don't know what they
are or where they come from.
As for nightmares..."
395,DR KING,395,"Did you know that in the last
three years twenty Philipino
refugees in California died
in the middle of nightmares?
Not from heart attacks, either.
They just died."
396,MARGE,396,"What happened?  That needle
sank like a rock."
397,DR KING,397,"She's entering deep sleep now.
Heart rate's a little high due
to anxiety, but otherwise she's
nicely relaxed.  All normal.
She could dream at any time now."
398,DR KING,398,"Right now she's like a diver
on the bottom of an ocean no
one's mapped yet.  Waiting to
see what shows up."
399,DR KING,399,"Okay, she's started to dream."
400,MARGE,400,How can you tell?
401,DR KING,401,"R.E.M.'s.  Rapid eye movements.
The eyes follow the
dream -- their movement picks
up on this --"
402,DR KING (CONTD),402,"Beta Waves are slowing, too.
She's dreaming, all right.
A good one, too."
403,DR KING (CONTD),403,"Typical dream parameter.  A
nightmare, now, would be plus or
minus five or six; she's just
around three point --"
404,MARGE,404,"What the hell's this?  She
awake or asleep?"
405,DR KING,405,"Can't be.  It never gets
this high..."
406,DR KING (CONTD),406,Jesus H. Christ.
407,MARGE,407,NANCY!!!  IT'S MOM -- NANCY!!!!
408,DR KING,408,"Now, this is just going to let
you relax and sleep, Nan --"
409,NANCY,409,No.  That's enough sleep.
410,DR KING,410,"Okay, kid.  Okay.  Fair enough."
411,MARGE,411,"Oh my god, oh my god..."
412,DR KING,412,Get the kit!
413,NANCY,413,You believe this?
414,MARGE,414,Where the hell did you get that?
415,NANCY,415,I grabbed it off his head.
416,MARGE,416,"She said she snatched it off
his head in a dream."
417,MARGE,417,"No, I'm not crazy, I've got
the damn thing in my hand!"
418,MARGE,418,"I know we did, we all..."
419,MARGE,419,Gotta go.
420,MARGE (CONTD),420,"You didn't sleep, did you?
The doctor says you have to
sleep or you'll --"
421,NANCY,421,Go even crazier?
422,MARGE,422,"I don't think you're going
crazy -- and stop drinking
that damn coffee!"
423,NANCY,423,"Did you ask Daddy to have the
hat examined?"
424,MARGE,424,"I threw that filthy thing away --
I don't know what you're trying
to prove with it, but --"
425,NANCY,425,"What I learned at the dream
clinic, that's what I'm trying
to prove.  Rod didn't kill Tina,
and he didn't hang himself.
It's this guy -- he's after
us in our dreams."
426,MARGE,426,But that's just
427,MARGE,427,Nancy!
428,NANCY,428,It's
429,MARGE,429,Put that damned thing down!
430,NANCY,430,"His name is even in it -- written
right in here -- Fred Krueger --
Fred Krueger!  You know who that
is, Mamma?  You better tell me,
cause now he's after me!"
431,MARGE,431,"Nancy, trust your mother for
once -- you'll feel better as
soon as you sleep!"
432,NANCY,432,"You call this feeling better?
Or should I grab a bottle and
veg out with you -- avoid
everything happening to me
by just getting good and loaded --"
433,MARGE,433,"Fred Krueger can't be after you,
Nancy -- he's"
434,MARGE (CONTD),434,"Fred Krueger is dead.  Dead and
gone.  Believe me, I know.  Now
go to bed.  I order you, go to
bed."
435,NANCY,435,You
436,NANCY,436,"this time, and you've been acting
like he was someone I made up!"
437,MARGE,437,"You're sick, Nancy.  Imagining
things.  You need to sleep,
it's as simple as that."
438,NANCY,438,Screw sleep!
439,MARGE (CONTD),439,Nancy!
440,MARGE (CONTD),440,Nancy -- it's only a nightmare!
441,NANCY,441,That's
442,GLEN,442,Whenever I get nervous I eat.
443,NANCY,443,"And if you can't do that, you
sleep."
444,GLEN,444,Used to.  Not anymore.
445,GLEN (CONTD),445,"You ever read about the Balinese
way of dreaming?"
446,NANCY,446,No.
447,GLEN,447,"They got a whole system they
call 'dream skills'.  So, if
you have a nightmare, for
instance like falling, right?"
448,NANCY,448,Yeah.
449,GLEN,449,"Instead of screaming and getting
nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna
make up my mind that I fall
into a magic world where I can
get something special, like a
poem or song."
450,GLEN,450,"They get all their art literature
from dreams.  Just wake up and
write it down.  Dreamskills."
451,NANCY,451,"And what if they meet a monster
in their dream?  Then what?"
452,GLEN,452,They turn their back on it.
453,GLEN,453,"Takes away its energy, and
it disappears."
454,NANCY,454,"What happens if they don't do
that?"
455,GLEN,455,"I guess those people don't
wake up to tell what happens."
456,NANCY,456,Great.
457,GLEN,457,"'Booby Traps and Improvised
Anti-personel Devices'!"
458,NANCY,458,"I found it at this neat
survivalist bookstore on
Ventura."
459,GLEN,459,Well what
460,NANCY,460,I'm into survival.
461,GLEN,461,"She's starting to scare the
living shit out of me."
462,FOREMAN,462,And the other...
463,MARGE,463,Where's your mask and gun?
464,FOREMAN,464,"Don't bust my chops, lady.
If the city found out I put
'em in without inside releases
I'd loose my license."
465,NANCY,465,Oh gross...
466,NANCY (OS),466,"Mom, what's with the bars!?"
467,NANCY,467,"Oh, Mom..."
468,MARGE,468,'S'mine...
469,NANCY,469,What's with the bars?
470,MARGE,470,S'curity.
471,NANCY,471,"Mom, I want to know what you
know about Fred Krueger."
472,MARGE,472,Dead and gone.
473,NANCY,473,"I want to know how, where --
if you don't tell me, I'm going
to call daddy."
474,MARGE (CONTD),474,"Your father the cop.  That's a
good one."
475,MARGE (CONTD),475,"Forget Fred Krueger.  You don't
want to know, believe me."
476,NANCY,476,I
477,NANCY,477,dead and gone -- he's
478,NANCY,478,"and if I sleep he'll get me!
I've got to know!"
479,MARGE,479,All right.
480,MARGE,480,"You want to know who Fred
Krueger was?  He was a filthy
child killer who got at least
twenty kids, kids from our
area, kids we all knew.  It
drove us all crazy when we
didn't know who was doing it --
but it was even worse when
they caught him."
481,MARGE (CONTD),481,"Oh lawyers got fat and the judge
got famous, but someone forgot to
sign the search warrant in the
right place, and Fred Krueger
was free, just like that."
482,NANCY,482,So he's alive?
483,MARGE,483,"He wouldn've stopped.  The
bastard would've got more
kids first chance he got --
they found nearly ten bodies
in his boiler room as it
was.  But the law couldn't
touch him."
484,MARGE (CONTD),484,"What was needed were some private
citizens willing to do what had
to be"
485,NANCY,485,"What did you do, mother?"
486,MARGE,486,"Bunch of us parents tracked him
down after they let him go.  Found
him in an old boiler room, just
like before.  Saw him lying there
in that caked red and yellow sweater
he always wore, drunk an' asleep
with his weird knives by his side..."
487,NANCY,487,Go on...
488,MARGE,488,"We poured gasoline all around
the place, left a trail out the
door, locked the door, then..."
489,MARGE (CONTD),489,WHOOSH!!!
490,MARGE (CONTD),490,"But just when it seemed not
even the devil could live
in there any more -- he crashed
out like a banshee, all on fire
-- swinging those fingerknives
every which direction and
screaming he... he was going
to get us by killing all our
kids..."
491,MARGE (CONTD),491,"There were all those men, Nancy,
even your father, oh yes, even
him.  But none could do what
had to be done -- Krueger rolling
and screaming so loud the whole
state could hear -- no one could
take your father's gun and kill
him good and proper except"
492,MARGE (CONTD),492,"So he's dead Nan.  He can't
get you.  Mommy killed him."
493,NANCY,493,"Who was there?  Were Tina's
parents there?  Were Rod's?"
494,MARGE,494,"Sure, and Glen's.  All of us.
But that's in the past now,
baby.  Really.  It's over."
495,MARGE,495,We even took his knives.
496,MARGE (CONTD),496,See?
497,NANCY,497,"All these years you've kept those
things buried down here?  In our
own house?"
498,MARGE (CONTD),498,"Proof he's declawed.  As for him,
we buried him good and deep."
499,MARGE (CONTD),499,"So's okay, you can sleep."
500,GLEN,500,Hello?
501,NANCY (telephone),501,Hi.
502,GLEN,502,"Oh.  Hi, how y'doing?"
503,NANCY (CONTD),503,"Fine.  Stand by your window
so I can see you.  You sound
a million miles away."
504,NANCY (CONTD),504,Much better.
505,GLEN,505,"I heard your ma went ape at the
security store today.  You look
like the Prisoner of Zenda or
something.  How long's it been
since you slept?"
506,NANCY,506,"Coming up on the seventh day.  It's
okay, I checked Guiness.  The
record's eleven, and I'll beat
that if I have to."
507,NANCY,507,"Listen, I... I know who he is."
508,GLEN,508,Who?
509,NANCY,509,The killer.
510,GLEN,510,You do?
511,NANCY,511,"Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm
pretty sure you're next."
512,GLEN,512,"Me!?  Why would anyone want to
kill me?!"
513,NANCY,513,"Don't ask -- just give me some
help nailing this guy when I
bring him out."
514,GLEN,514,Bring him out of what?
515,NANCY,515,My dream.
516,GLEN,516,How you plan to do that?
517,NANCY,517,"Just like I did the hat.  Have
a hold of the sucker when you
wake me up."
518,GLEN,518,Me?
519,GLEN,519,"Wait a minute, you can't bring
someone out of a dream!"
520,NANCY,520,"If I can't, then you all can
relax, because it'll just be a
simple case of me being nuts."
521,GLEN,521,"I can save you the trouble.
You're nutty as a fruitcake.
I love you anyway."
522,NANCY,522,"Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking
this guy when I bring him out."
523,NANCY,523,"You heard me.  I grab him in the
dream -- you see me struggling
so you wake me up.  We both come
out, you cold cock the fucker,
and we got him.  Clever, huh?"
524,GLEN,524,You crazy?  Hit him with what?
525,NANCY,525,"You're a jock.  You must have
a baseball bat or something.
Come to my window at midnight.
And meanwhile..."
526,GLEN,526,Meanwhile..?
527,NANCY,527,"Meanwhile whatever you do
don't fall asleep.  Midnight."
528,GLEN,528,"Holy shit!  Midnight.  Baseball
bats and boogemen.  Unfucking
real."
529,COP (passing),529,"Lieutenant Thompson -- what
you doing in at this time?"
530,LT THOMPSON,530,"Can't sleep, thought I'd come
break up the poker game."
531,SERGEANT GARCIA,531,"If it was any more quiet we
could hear owls farting."
532,LT THOMPSON,532,"Is quiet, isn't it?"
533,SERGEANT GARCIA,533,How's your girl?
534,LT THOMPSON,534,"She's sensible.  She'll sleep
sooner or later."
535,MR LANTZ,535,You'd think they'd have
536,MR LANTZ,536,"thing 'bout the Lane kid hanging
himself."
537,MRS LANTZ,537,"Maybe we're all making more out
of it than we should."
538,CARSON (TV),538,"I wouldn't touch that line with
a ten foot pole."
539,MRS LANTZ,539,Glen?  you all right?
540,MRS LANTZ (CONTD),540,Glen honey?
541,GLEN,541,Whuu?
542,MRS LANTZ,542,"How can you listen to Carson and
a record at the same time?"
543,GLEN,543,"Wasn't listening to the tube,
just watching.  Miss Nude
America's supposed to be on
tonight."
544,MRS LANTZ,544,"Well how you gonna hear what
she says?"
545,GLEN,545,Who cares what she says?
546,MRS LANTZ,546,"You should get to sleep soon,
Glen.  It's almost midnight.
Goodness knows we've all had
enough of a time the last few
days..."
547,GLEN,547,"I will, Mom...in a while.
You guys turning in?"
548,MRS LANTZ,548,Pretty soon.
549,MARGE,549,"We'll go away, take a vacation.
Get your hair colored nice, the
way it was.  No one will ever
know."
550,MARGE,550,"This whole room smells of coffee,
y'know?"
551,MARGE (CONTD),551,"It's all over now, baby.  The
nightmare's over.  Please."
552,NANCY,552,Okay.
553,NANCY (CONTD),553,Night-night.
554,MRS LANTZ,554,Shouldn't stare.
555,MR LANTZ,555,"Know what I think?  I think
that kid's some kinda lunatic."
556,MRS LANTZ,556,"Shouldn't say such a thing about
the poor child.  If you mean the
bars, Marge's just being cautious,
her being alone and Nancy acting
so nervous lately."
557,MR LANTZ (CONTD),557,"Well, she ain't gonna hang around
our boy no more."
558,NANCY,558,Hang on GLEN...
559,GLEN,559,"Well, I'm not gonna risk
sneaking out until she does."
560,MR LANTZ,560,Who at this hour?
561,MRS LANTZ,561,Hello?
562,MRS LANTZ,562,Oh... Hold on.
563,MRS LANTZ,563,It's
564,MRS LANTZ,564,Glen.
565,MR LANTZ,565,About what?
566,MRS LANTZ,566,"What's this about, Nancy?"
567,MRS LANTZ (CONTD),567,"She says it's private.  Very
private and very important."
568,MR LANTZ,568,"Glen's asleep.  Talk to him
tomorrow!"
569,MR LANTZ (CONTD),569,"Just got to be firm with kids,
is all."
570,NANCY,570,Glen.
571,NANCY,571,Glen?
572,NANCY,572,"Brilliant.  Now what if Glen
calls?"
573,NANCY (CONTD),573,Hello?
574,KRUEGER (FILTER),574,I'm your boyfriend now...
575,NANCY,575,"I'm awake, I am awake.  This is
not a dream!  I am --"
576,NANCY (CONTD),576,My boyfriend...!
577,VOICE (OS),577,Locked.
578,NANCY,578,"Give me the key, mother."
579,MARGE,579,"I don't even have it on me,
so forget it."
580,MARGE (CONTD),580,"Paid the guy damn good to make
sure you stayed put.  You ain't
goin' nowhere, kid.  You're
gonna sleep tonight if it kills
me."
581,NANCY,581,GLEEENNNNNN!
582,NANCY (OS),582,Glen!!  Don't fall asleeeeeep!
583,NANCY,583,"Okay, Krueger, you bastard.
We play in your court."
584,PARKER,584,"Lieutenant.  It's your daughter.
Says it's urgent."
585,LT THOMPSON,585,"Tell her I'm not here, tell
her..."
586,PARKER,586,"Uh, she just saw you, sir..."
587,LT THOMPSON (CONTD),587,Hello Nancy.
588,NANCY,588,Hi daddy.  I know what happened.
589,LT THOMPSON,589,"Then you know more than I do --
I haven't even been upstairs."
590,NANCY,590,"You know he's dead though, right?"
591,LT THOMPSON,591,"Yeah, apparantly he's dead.
How the hell'd you know?"
592,NANCY,592,"I've got a proposition for
you.  Listen very carefully,
please."
593,LT THOMPSON,593,"Nan, I --"
594,NANCY,594,"Please.  I'm gonna go get
the guy who did it and bring
him to you.  I just need you
be right there to arrest him.
Okay?"
595,LT THOMPSON,595,"Just tell me who did it and
I'll go get him, baby."
596,NANCY,596,"Fred Krueger did it, Daddy,
and only I can get him.  It's
my nightmare he comes to."
597,LT THOMPSON,597,Where'd you hear about Krueger --
598,NANCY,598,"-- I want you to come over here
and break the door down exactly
twenty minutes from now -- can
you do that?"
599,LT THOMPSON,599,"Sure, but..."
600,NANCY,600,"That'll be exactly half past
midnight.  Time for me to fall
asleep and find him."
601,LT THOMPSON,601,"Sure, sure, honey.  You just
do that -- get yourself some
sleep -- that's what I've been
saying all along."
602,NANCY,602,"And you'll be here to catch
him, right?"
603,PARKER,603,"Lieutenant -- they're waiting
upstairs."
604,LT THOMPSON,604,"Sure, okay, I'll be there.
Now you just turn in and get
some rest, sweetheart.  Please.
Deal?"
605,NANCY,605,Deal.
606,LT THOMPSON (CONTD),606,"Get outside and watch her house.
If you see anything funny call
me."
607,PARKER,607,'Anything funny' like what?
608,LT THOMPSON,608,"I don't know -- but one thing
for sure, I don't want her
coming over here.  She's way
too far gone to be able to
to handle this."
609,COP,609,"What the hell did that,
Lieutenant?  There ain't even
a head left."
610,LT THOMPSON,610,Goddamed if I know.
611,LT THOMPSON,611,What's the Coronor say?
612,COP,612,"He's in the john puking since
he saw it."
613,MARGE,613,Guess I should'n'a done it.
614,NANCY,614,"Just sleep now, Mom."
615,MARGE,615,"Just wanted to protect you,
Nan.  Just wanted to protect
you..."
616,NANCY (quietly),616,"Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take."
617,LT THOMPSON,617,"I know it's hard to think at
a time like this, Walter, but
can you think of anyone who
could've done such a thing?"
618,MR LANTZ,618,He done it.
619,LT THOMPSON,619,Who?  Who did that?
620,MR LANTZ,620,Krueger.
621,LT THOMPSON,621,Krueger?
622,MR LANTZ,622,"Had to've done it.  No one
else was in there."
623,LT THOMPSON,623,How you know that?
624,MR LANTZ,624,"Cause I thought Glen was
gonna sneak out to see your
lunatic daughter, that's why.
So I locked him in his room!"
625,MR LANTZ,625,"Sorry.  Anyways, the door was
still locked when we heard the
screams."
626,MR LANTZ (CONTD),626,Maybe god's punishing us all...
627,LT THOMPSON,627,"Keep your head -- this is a
fucking flesh and blood killer
we're talking about."
628,MR LANTZ,628,Like Rod Lane?
629,COP (OS),629,"Lieutenant Thompson.  Coronor
wants to show you something."
630,NANCY,630,"Come out and show yourself,
you bastard."
631,NANCY,631,I'm crazy after all...
632,NANCY,632,"Help!  Hey -- Daddy -- I got
him trapped!  Where"
633,PARKER,633,"Everything's going to be all
right!  Everything's under
control!"
634,NANCY,634,"Get my father, you asshole!"
635,PARKER (OS),635,"You heard what I said!  Now get
back inside or I'll tell your
dad!"
636,MARGE,636,No!
637,MARGE,637,Nancy -- for god's sake's run!
638,NANCY,638,Daddy!  Where are you!
639,PARKER,639,"Poor woman's got her hands full
with that kid.  Maybe I better
tell the lieutenant."
640,NANCY,640,Hey fuckface -- can't catch
641,NANCY,641,"Come on -- he's in here!
Daddy!  Don't let him kill
me too!"
642,NANCY (CONTD),642,HEELLLPPP!!!  Daddyyyyyyy!!!!
643,NANCY (CONTD),643,"Hey -- Daddy!  Hey!  I got the
bastard!"
644,KRUEGER,644,Ready for these?
645,CORONER,645,"Found you something, Donald.
Should remind you of something..."
646,CORONER (CONTD),646,"Only place I ever heard of such
a thing before was ten years
ago.  Remember that fucker
Fred Krueger?"
647,PARKER,647,"Hey -- your daughter's acting
kinda -- !"
648,PARKER,648,Strange...
649,NANCY,649,DAD!  GET US OUTTA HERE!
650,LT THOMPSON,650,"Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!"
651,LT THOMPSON,651,Hey!  We got a fire!
652,NANCY,652,I got him -- I got Fred Krueger!
653,LT THOMPSON,653,"What the hell are you talking about,
Nancy?"
654,NANCY (CONTD),654,He's after Mom!  Come on!
655,LT THOMPSON,655,NANCY!
656,NANCY,656,He's under there!  Watch it!
657,NANCY,657,Now do you believe me?
658,PARKER,658,You find him?
659,PARKER,659,Sir?
660,PARKER (CONTD OS),660,"Sir -- here, let me light that
for you -- Lieutenant?  What
happened?"
661,NANCY,661,"I know you're there, Krueger."
662,FREDDIE,662,"You think you was gonna get
away from me?"
663,NANCY,663,"I know you too well now,
Freddie."
664,FREDDY,664,And now
665,NANCY,665,"It's too late, Krueger.  I
know the secret now -- this
is just a dream, too -- you're
not alive -- the whole thing
is a dream -- so fuck off!
I want my mother and friends
again."
666,FREDDIE,666,You
667,NANCY,667,"I take back every bit of
energy I ever gave you.
You're nothing.  You're
shit."
668,NANCY,668,"God, it's bright."
669,MARGE,669,"Gonna burn off soon or it
wouldn't be so bright."
670,NANCY,670,Feeling better?
671,MARGE,671,"They say you've bottomed out
when you can't remember the
night before."
672,MARGE,672,"No more drinking, Baby, suddenly
I just don't"
673,MARGE,673,any more.
674,MARGE (CONTD),674,"Didn't keep you up last night,
did I?  You look a little
peeked."
675,NANCY,675,Nah.  Just slept heavy.
676,MARGE,676,See ya.
677,NANCY,677,See ya.
678,GLEN,678,You believe this fog?
679,MARGE,679,I believe anything's possible.
680,TINA,680,"Lookin' good, girl!"
681,GIRLS,681,"One two --
Freddy's coming for you!
Three four --
Better lock your door!
Five six --
Get your Crucifix
Seven eight --
Gonna stay up late!
