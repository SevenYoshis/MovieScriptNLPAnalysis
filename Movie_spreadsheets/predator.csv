0,MAN                                 *,0,He's here.
1,PHILIPS,1,"You're looking well, Dutch."
2,SCHAEFER,2,"It's been a long time, General."
3,PHILIPS,3,"We've got a real problem here,
something right up your alley."
4,PHILIPS,4,"Eighteen hours ago I was
informed that one of our
choppers, transporting three
presidential cabinet members
from this charming little
country, was shot down..."
5,PHILIPS,5,"...The pilots radioed from the
ground that they were all
alive.  Their position was
fixed by the transponder
beacon onboard the chopper."
6,PHILIPS,6,Here.
7,SCHAEFER,7,"That's over the border,
General."
8,PHILIPS,8,"That's the problem.  Apparently
they strayed off course."
9,PHILIPS,9,"We're certain they've been
captured by the guerrillas."
10,SCHAEFER,10,"What have you got in mind,
General."
11,PHILIPS,11,"We figure we've got less than
twenty-four hours to catch
up with them.  After that,
there's not much hope.  We
want a rescue operation
mounted tonight.  That doesn't
give you much time."
12,SCHAEFER,12,"What else it new?  When do
we leave?"
13,PHILIPS,13,You lift off in three hours.
14,PHILIPS,14,There's one other thing.
15,SCHAEFER,15,"What's that, General?"
16,PHILIPS,16,"Someone else will be going
in with you."
17,SCHAEFER,17,"You know we don't work with
outsiders, General."
18,VOICE,18,"Who said anything about
outsiders, Dutch?"
19,DILLON,19,"Last time we danced, it was
Lieutenant, Schaefer."
20,SCHAEFER,20,"Dillon, you son of a bitch."
21,DILLON,21,"How you been, Dutch?"
22,SCHAEFER,22,"You've been pushing too many
Pencils, Dillon.  Had enough?"
23,DILLON,23,"No way, old buddy."
24,SCHAEFER,24,"You never did know when to
quit."
25,DILLON,25,"That piece of work you guys
pulled off at the Berlin
embassy last week was really
something.  Blew the entry
points on three floors and
neutralized the opposition
in eight seconds flat.
Beautiful."
26,SCHAEFER,26,"Like the old days, Dillon."
27,DILLON,27,"Also heard that you passed
on that little job in Libya."
28,SCHAEFER,28,"Wasn't my style.  We're a
rescue unit, not assassins."
29,SCHAEFER,29,"This must be good.  Big shot
from the CIA, leaves his desk
to come back to the bush.
What's so important?"
30,DILLON,30,"Those cabinet members are
very important to our scope
of operations in this part
of the world.  They're about
to get squeezed.  We can't
let that happen.  I needed
someone who could get the job
done, quick and quiet...no
screw-ups.  I needed the best.
The best.  So, I pulled a few
strings at the State
Department...and here we are."
31,SCHAEFER,31,Go on.
32,DILLON,32,"The set-up is simple, Dutch.
One day job.  We pick up their
trail at the chopper, run 'em
down, grab the hostages and
bounce back across the
border before anyone knows
we were there.  You've done
it a hundred times.  Nothing
out of the ordinary."
33,SCHAEFER,33,"And nothing we can't handle
alone."
34,PHILIPS,34,"I'm afraid those are your
orders, Major.  Once you
reach your objective, Dillon
will evaluate the situation
and take charge."
35,DILLON,35,"Not to worry, Dutch.  I
haven't lost my edge.  They've
got a head start on us in
some real tough country,
otherwise, believe me, it's
a piece of cake."
36,PHILIPS,36,"Gentlemen, we're losing time."
37,PHILIPS,37,"You'd better get your men
ready."
38,PHILIPS,38,"Good luck, Major."
39,PILOT ONE,39,"Redbird Two, Two.  Bearing
south, three, five, zero, one
o'ckock on the saddle ridge.
Over."
40,PILOT TWO,40,"Roger, Blue Leader.  Three,
five, zero, on your move.
Over."
41,HAWKINS,41,"Hey, Billy, how many marines
does it take to eat a squirrel?"
42,HAWKINS,42,"Two.  One to eat it and one
to watch for cars."
43,RAMIREZ,43,"Get that stinkin' thing out
of my face, Blain!"
44,BLAIN,44,"...bunch of slack-jawed
faggots around here..."
45,BLAIN,45,"...this stuff will put hair
guaranteed..."
46,BLAIN,46,"...make you a God-damned
sexual ty-ran-toe-sore-ass...
just like me."
47,DILLON,47,"Our rendezvous points and
radio freqs. are indicated
and fixed.  AWACS contact on
four hour intervals."
48,SCHAEFER,48,Who's our back-up on this?
49,DILLON,49,"No such thing, old buddy.
It's a one way ticket.
Once we cross that border,
we're on our own."
50,SCHAEFER,50,"This gets better by the
minute."
51,PILOT NUMBER ONE,51,"...roger Bird Two, Two.
Reconfirm insertion at Tango,
Charlie, Delta One, zero,
niner on the grid at zero,
two, two, mark four by zero.
Over."
52,PILOT NUMBER TWO,52,"Two, Two, leader.  Roger your
insert co-ord.  Over."
53,PILOT NUMBER ONE,53,"Leader to Bird Two Two.  I
bear two minutes to Landing
Zone."
54,DILLON,54,"Man, that's a real bad habit
you've got."
55,PILOT NUMBER ONE,55,"LZ comin' up in 30 seconds.
Stand by the rappel lines."
56,DILLON,56,"You don't know how much I
missed this, Dutch!!!  Once
you get this in your blood,
you never get it out!!!"
57,SCHAEFER,57,"You never were all that
smart...let's go!!!"
58,RAMIREZ,58,"The pilots have each got one
round in the head.  And whoever
hit it stripped the shit out of it."
59,SCHAEFER,59,Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
60,RAMIREZ,60,"There's something else, Major..."
61,SCHAEFER,61,Mmmnnn...?
62,RAMIREZ,62,"I don't think that was any ordinary
army taxi..."
63,RAMIREZ,63,"...looks more like a surveillance
bird to me."
64,DILLON,64,Have you picked up their trail yet?
65,SCHAEFER,65,Billy's on it.
66,SCHAEFER,66,"Heat seeker.  Pretty sophisticated
for half-asses mountain boys."
67,DILLON,67,"They're getting better equipped
every day."
68,BILLY,68,"Major, looks like there were ten,
maybe twelve guerrillas.  Looks
like they took some prisoners
from the chopper."
69,BILLY,69,"Then a different set of track,
over there."
70,SCHAEFER,70,What do you mean?
71,BILLY,71,"Six others, U.S. issue jungle
boots.  They came in from the
north, then followed the guerrillas."
72,SCHAEFER,72,Mean anything to you?
73,DILLON,73,"Probably another rebel patrol.
They operate in here all the time."
74,SCHAEFER,74,"Get ahead, see what you can find."
75,SCHAEFER,75,Slow and easy.
76,SCHAEFER (Contd.),76,We don't want any accidents.
77,SCHAEFER                            *,77,What's he got?
78,RAMIREZ                             *,78,"Same business, guerrillas
hauling two guys from the
chopper...followed by men
with American equipment..."
79,RAMIREZ,79,Holy Mother...
80,SCHAEFER,80,"J.S. Davis, Captain, U.S. Army..."
81,SCHAEFER,81,Mac.  Cut them down.
82,SCHAEFER,82,"I knew this man.  Green Berets,
out of Fort Bragg.  What the hell
were they doing in here?  You got
any answers for this, Dillon?"
83,DILLON,83,Jesus...this is inhuman.
84,DILLON,84,"Uh...I wasn't told of any
operations in this area.  They
shouldn't have been here."
85,SCHAEFER,85,Well somebody sent them.
86,RAMIREZ,86,"Must have run into the guerrillas
...Fucking animals."
87,MAC,87,"Ain't no way for a soldier to
die."
88,MAC,88,"Time to let 'ol 'painless'
out of the bag."
89,SCHAEFER,89,"What happened here, Billy?"
90,BILLY,90,"Strange, Major.  There was a
firefight.  Shooting in all
directions."
91,SCHAEFER,91,"I can't believe Jim Hopper
walked into an ambush."
92,BILLY,92,"I don't believe he did, Sir.
I couldn't find a single track.
Just doesn't make sense."
93,SCHAEFER,93,"What about the rest of Hopper's
men?"
94,BILLY,94,"No sign.  They never left here
Major."
95,BILLY,95,It's like they just disappeared.
96,SCHAEFER,96,Stick with the guerilla trail.
97,SCHAEFER,97,"Let's get it over with.  We move.
Five meter spread.  No sound.
Nothing."
98,BLAIN,98,Payback time.
99,MAC,99,"You're ghostin' on me, mother
fokaaa!...I don't care who
you are back in the world...
You give away our position
again and I'll bleed you quiet
and leave your fuckin' ass
right here."
100,MAC,100,Got it?
101,BLAIN,101,"Say, Bull.  What's goin' down?
We got movement?"
102,MAC,102,"No.  Shithead with his
trenchcoat and dee-coda-da
ring was makin' enough noise
to get us all waxed.  I don't
like that guy.  Don't like
him at my back.  I ain't
winding up like those
bastards back there."
103,BLAIN,103,"I know what you mean, Bull,
but don't sweat it, me and
'ol 'painless' here are
watchin' the front door."
104,MAC,104,"As always, bro..."
105,SCHAEFER,105,"Just killed one of the                             *
prisoners.  No time for                            *
invitations.  We take them,
now."
106,DILLON,106,"Ready, kid?"
107,DILLON,107,On your nine!!!
108,SCHAEFER,108,Stick around.
109,SCHAEFER,109,Down!!!
110,SCHAEFER,110,"Hawk, Get Con. Op. on the
hook!  Position and situation,
now!"
111,HAWKINS,111,"You got it, Major!"
112,SCHAEFER,112,Any sign of the hostages?
113,MAC,113,"We found 'em both, dead.
And the gear from the chopper.
If they're Central American,
I'm a fuckin' Chinaman.  By                        *
the looks of 'em, I'd say our                      *
cabinet minister and his aide                      *
are CIA."
114,MAC,114,"Another thing, Major, we were
lucky...couple of those guys
we waxed are Russians,
military advisors by the look
of it.  Something big was
about to happen here."
115,SCHAEFER,115,"Good work, Mac.  Clear the
area, no traces.  Get the men
ready to move."
116,SCHAEFER,116,Shit...
117,RAMIREZ,117,"You're hit.  You're bleedin',
man."
118,BLAIN,118,Ain't got time to bleed.
119,BLAIN,119,"Son of a bitch's dug in like
a Alabama tick..."
120,BLAIN,120,...jack us around all day.
121,RAMIREZ,121,"Hell, dude, we don't have all
day."
122,BLAIN,122,"Shit, Pancho!!!"
123,RAMIREZ,123,"What's your problem, dude?"
124,DILLON,124,"This is beautiful!  More than
we ever thought.  We got the
bastards!"
125,SCHAEFER,125,I think this is the one you want.
126,DILLON,126,"Two days...that's all we had.
In two days, three hundred of
these bastards would have been
equipped with all this.  After
they crossed the border, it
would have taken a year to
stop them."
127,DILLON,127,"We've averted a major
guerrilla invasion, Dutch..."
128,SCHAEFER,128,"It was all bullshit.  All of it.
From the start...you set us up,
got us in here to do your
dirty work."
129,DILLON,129,"That's right, I set you up.
You're a veteran at this, Dutch,
I had to."
130,SCHAEFER,130,Why us?
131,DILLON,131,"Because I told you, you're the
best.  I knew you could do it but
I couldn't get you in here without
a cover story."
132,SCHAEFER,132,What story did you give to Davis?
133,DILLON,133,"We've been lookin' for this
place for months.  The chopper
must have gotten close when
they got shot down.  Hopper                        *
was sent in to get my men.
He was just doing his job.
When he disappeared I had to
clean this up,  I had to stop
there bastards.  We were so
close, we couldn't quit.  We
couldn't sleep through this
one.  I needed you, Dutch,
can't you see that?"
134,DILLON,134,"To invade a foreign country,
illegally?  You lied, Dillon.
Stacked the odds against us.  Set
us up.  You could have gotten
us all killed."
135,DILLON,135,"You used to be one of us,
Dillon, someone I could trust
with my life..."
136,DILLON,136,"We've been through a lot together
Dutch.  When we were together, no                  *
one could stop us, the hottest                     *
Goddamned team the army ever saw.                  *
But things changed, I woke up.
We're fighting them in a dozen
Goddamned countries.  It's a
fight we can't lose, Dutch.  We're
all expendable assets, can't you
see that?"
137,SCHAEFER,137,"That's your problem, Dillon.
You always did put ambition
before the lives of your men."
138,SCHAEFER,138,"My men are not expendable.  I
don't do this kind of work."
139,SCHAEFER,139,"This is your dirty little war,
not mine."
140,HAWKINS,140,Major!
141,DILLON,141,Are you all right?
142,HAWKINS,142,"Major, we stepped into some
real shit here.  I got a hook-up
with aerial surveillance."
143,SCHAEFER,143,Movement?
144,HAWKINS,144,"Guerrillas swarming like flies                     *
all over the place.  Can't be more                 *
then one, maybe two miles away.                    *
Place is going down, Major."
145,SCHAEFER,145,How much time?
146,HAWKINS,146,"Half an hour, maybe less.                          *"
147,SCHAEFER,147,Tell Mac we move in five.
148,DILLON,148,She goes with us.
149,DILLON,149,"She's too valuable.  She's
got to know their whole
network.  The whole set up.
We take her with us.                               *"
150,SCHAEFER,150,"We take her and she'll give
away our position, every
chance she gets.  No
prisoners, Dillon."
151,DILLON,151,"You're still under orders,
Dutch.  You want to make the
call, or should I?"
152,SCHAEFER,152,"I'm getting my men out of this
damn jungle, Dillon.  She's
your baggage.  You fall behind,
you're on your own."
153,SCHAEFER,153,"This place is too hot for a pick-up.
They won't touch us until we're over
the border.  We can lift at LZ 49,
here."
154,SCHAEFER,154,Spotter plane says we're cut off.
155,SCHAEFER,155,Except for this valley.
156,BILLY,156,"Looks bad, Major.  It's gonna be
a real bitch."
157,BILLY,157,"If we follow above the river and
then down, here, at this canyon,
we might find a way out."
158,SCHAEFER,158,"Not much choice.  Pancho, take
the lead.  Double time it."
159,SCHAEFER,159,"Lock n' load, watch your ass."
160,ANNA,160,"You touch me again, pig, and
I will cut off your balls!"
161,DILLON,161,"It's a long walk back, make it
easy on yourself."
162,MAC,162,"Hey, Dillon, over here."
163,MAC,163,"Dillon, over here."
164,DILLON,164,"Yeah, what is it, Sergeant?"
165,ANNA,165,"When my people catch you,
you'll wish you were him."
166,DILLON,166,Thanks.
167,MAC,167,Anytime.
168,HUNTER,168,"Dillon, over here."
169,HUNTER,169,"Dillon, over here."
170,HUNTER,170,"Dillon, over here."
171,MAC,171,"I've seen some badass bush
before, but nothin' like
this, man."
172,MAC,172,Little taste 'o home?
173,BLAIN,173,"I hear you bro, this is some
shit.  Makes Cambodia look
like Kansas.  Lose your way
in here, man, you be in some
kinda hurt."
174,DILLON,174,Shit.  Come on...
175,RAMIREZ,175,Don't try it.
176,RAMIREZ,176,"You should put her on a leash,
Agent Man.  If you can't handle
her, just say the word."
177,DILLON,177,Try that again.  Please.                           *
178,DILLON,178,Watch her.
179,SCHAEFER,179,What's got Billy so spooked?
180,MAC,180,"Can't say, Major...been
squirrely all mornin'...
fuckin' weird...sometimes
I think that nose of his is
too good...smells things that
ain't there."
181,SCHAEFER,181,What is it...?
182,SCHAEFER,182,"Billy...What the hell's wrong
with you?"
183,BILLY,183,Something...in the trees...
184,BILLY,184,Can you see anything...
185,BILLY,185,...there?
186,SCHAEFER,186,It's...nothing...
187,SCHAEFER,187,What do you think...?
188,BILLY,188,It's nothing...
189,HAWKINS,189,Please...
190,ANNA,190,"Look out, behind you!!!"
191,SCHAEFER,191,It's not her blood.
192,RAMIREZ,192,"Major, you'd better take a
look at this."
193,SCHAEFER,193,Hawkins?
194,RAMIREZ,194,I can't tell.
195,SCHAEFER,195,What in God's name...?
196,RAMIREZ,196,I think it's Hawkins.
197,SCHAEFER,197,Where the hell is his body?
198,RAMIREZ,198,There's no sign of it.
199,SCHAEFER,199,"Ramirez, ask her what
happened."
200,RAMIREZ,200,"She says...the jungle came
alive, and took him..."
201,DILLON,201,"That isn't what she said...
she said..."
202,DILLON,202,...she doesn't make sense.
203,RAMIREZ,203,"Couple of sappers been
trailing us all the way from
the camp, Major.  Billy heard
them.  She set us up, ran
for it...They were waiting.
I should've wasted the bitch
when I had the chance."
204,SCHAEFER,204,"Why didn't they take the
radio and his weapon?"
205,SCHAEFER,205,Why didn't she escape?
206,DILLON,206,"They did the same thing to
Davis..."
207,SCHAEFER,207,"I want him found.  Sweep
pattern and double back.  Fifty
meters."
208,BLAIN,208,"Come on in you fuckers...come on
in.  'ol 'painless' is waitin'..."
209,MAC,209,"Contact, 30 Right!!!"
210,MAC,210,I...saw it.
211,SCHAEFER,211,You saw what?
212,MAC,212,I saw it.
213,SCHAEFER,213,Blain...
214,SCHAEFER,214,"...Just like the others...no
powder burns, no shrapnel."
215,DILLON,215,"The wound all fused,
cauterized...what the hell
did this?"
216,SCHAEFER,216,...Mac!
217,SCHAEFER,217,Mac!  Mac!  Look at me!
218,SCHAEFER,218,"Mac, who did this?"
219,MAC,219,"I don't know.  Goddamn it,
something...I saw something/."
220,RAMIREZ,220,"Nothing.  The same thing.
Not a fucking trace.  No
bodies, blood, anything."
221,SCHAEFER,221,"We're losing the light.  Mac,
I want a defensive position
above this ridge, mined with
everything we're got."
222,MAC,222,Yessir.
223,SCHAEFER,223,"Put him in his poncho and
liner and carry him back.
We'll bury him in the morning."
224,MAC,224,I'll take him.
225,MAC,225,"We've got most of the flares,
frags. and two claymores just
outside.  Nothin's comin'
close to here without trippin'
on somethin'."
226,SCHAEFER,226,"Thank you, Sergeant."
227,SCHAEFER,227,"I'm sorry, Bull.  It's never
easy.  He was a good soldier."
228,MAC,228,The best friend I ever had.
229,MAC,229,"Good-bye, Bro."
230,DILLON,230,"Blazer One, say again..."
231,BLAZER ONE,231,"Red Fox, I say again.  Your
request for extraction denied.
Your area still compromised.
Proceed to Sector 3000 for
prisoner extraction, Priority
Alpha.  Next contact at 1030
hours."
232,DILLON,232,"Roger, Blazer One.  1030
hours...damn, bastards."
233,DILLON,233,"We're still too far in, they
won't risk coming in for us."
234,SCHAEFER,234,"Expendable assets, Dillon.
Seems Langley is never around
when you need them."
235,DILLON,235,"I can accept that, it comes
with the job."
236,SCHAEFER,236,"Bullshit.  You're just like
the rest of us."
237,RAMIREZ,237,"Shit load o' good a chopper'd
do us in here anyway."
238,DILLON,238,Mac.  Who hit us today?
239,MAC,239,"Don't know, only saw one of
'em.  Camouflaged.  He was
there..."
240,MAC,240,...Those fucking eyes...
241,DILLON,241,"What, Sergeant?"
242,MAC,242,"Those eyes...disappeared.  But
I know one thing, Major..."
243,MAC,243,"...I drew down and fired
right at it.  Capped-off two
hundred rounds and then the
Mini-gun; the full pack.
Nothin'...nothin' on this
earth could have lived...not
at that range."
244,MAC,244,I've got the first watch.
245,DILLON,245,"Ask her again.  What did she
see?  What happened to
Hawkins?"
246,RAMIREZ,246,"She says the same thing...
It was the jungle..."
247,RAMIREZ,247,"You know something Billy, what
is it?"
248,BILLY,248,I'm scared.
249,RAMIREZ,249,"Bullshit.  You ain't afraid
of no man."
250,BILLY,250,"There's something out there,
waiting for us...it ain't
no man."
251,DILLON,251,"He's losing his cool.  There's
nothing out there but a couple
of men that we're going to
have to take down."
252,SCHAEFER,252,"You still don't get it, do
you Dillon?  He took Davis...
and now he wants us."
253,MAC,253,"It's the same kinda jungle,
Bro, same moon...
everything..."
254,MAC,254,"...a real number ten night.
Remember Bro?  Only you and
me, the only one's out of the
whole fuckin' platoon who made
it out."
255,MAC,255,"...we walked out on top of
'em.  Not a scratch, not a
fuckin' scratch."
256,MAC,256,"No fuckin' chili-choker got
to you, Bro...you were just
too good..."
257,MAC,257,"...I promise you this, Bro...
whoever he is, I hope he's
plannin' to hit us again..."
258,MAC,258,"...'cause he's got my name
on 'em."
259,MAC,259,Got the motherfucker...
260,MAC,260,A pig...just a fucking pig...
261,RAMIREZ,261,"Holy shit, Mac."
262,SCHAEFER,262,"Get a field dressing on that
right away."
263,SCHAEFER,263,Where's the girl?
264,BILLY,264,"Major, over here."
265,BILLY,265,The body...it's gone.
266,RAMIREZ,266,"Came in through the trip
wires, took it right out from
under our noses..."
267,BILLY,267,"Boar set off the trip flare,
Major.  No other tracks."
268,RAMIREZ,268,"How could anyone get through
this, carry Blain out, right                       *
under our noses without leavin'                    *
a trace?"
269,SCHAEFER,269,He knows our defenses.                             *
270,RAMIREZ,270,"Why didn't he try to kill one
of us last night?"
271,SCHAEFER,271,He came back for the body.
272,SCHAEFER,272,"He's killing us, one at a
time..."
273,BILLY,273,Like a Hunter.                                     *
274,SCHAEFER,274,He uses the trees.                                 *
275,SCHAEFER,275,Yesterday.  What did you see?
276,DILLON,276,You're wastin' your time.
277,SCHAEFER,277,No more games.
278,ANNA,278,"I don't know what it was.
It..."
279,SCHAEFER,279,Go on.
280,ANNA,280,"It changes colors, like the
chameleon.  It uses the jungle..."
281,DILLON,281,"Shit, you trying to tell me
Blain and Hawkins were killed
by a fucking lizard?  Don't
listen to her.  Its's a psych-job.
Two, maybe three of them, that's                   *
all.  We keep our cool, out-think                  *
them 'til we're across the                         *
border...                                          *"
282,SCHAEFER,282,What's you name?
283,ANNA,283,Anna.
284,SCHAEFER,284,"Anna.  He's hunting us.  You
know that?"
285,DILLON,285,"What the hell do you think
you're doing?"
286,SCHAEFER,286,We're going to need everyone.                      *
287,DILLON,287,"What are you talking about?
We'll be out of here in ten                        *
minutes.                                           *"
288,SCHAEFER,288,We're not going.                                   *
289,DILLON,289,"That rendezvous is ten maybe                       *
twelve miles, at most!  We're                      *
almost home.  But the chopper                      *
won't wait."
290,SCHAEFER,290,"Dillon...This thing doesn't                        *
care who we are, who she is.
We make a stand or there won't                     *
be anyone left to make that                        *
chopper."
291,ANNA,291,"There is something else.  When
the big man was killed, you
must have wounded it."
292,ANNA,292,It's blood was on the leaves.
293,SCHAEFER,293,"If it bleeds, we can kill it."
294,DILLON,294,"I'm tellin' you, this little                       *
'boy scout' stunt is a                             *
Godamned waste of time.                            *"
295,DILLON,295,"We've got to get the hell out                      *
of here, now, while we've still                    *
got the chance."
296,SCHAEFER,296,"He'll be looking for the trip wires.
If we're lucky, he won't see this."
297,DILLON,297,"Now what, Dutch.  You going to
send your mystery guest an
invitation?"
298,SCHAEFER,298,"You're catching on, Dillon."
299,ANNA,299,When I was little we find a man --
300,ANNA,300,"-- like a butcher.  The old ones in
the village cross themselves and
whisper crazy things.  'Demonio,
cazador de trofoes...Only the hottest
times of the hottest years...'  Crazy
things...This year is grows hot.  And
we begin finding our men.  We find
them sometimes without their skin.
Sometimes...much, much worse.  Cazador
de trofoes...means the demon who takes
trophies."
301,DILLON,301,What'll you try next -- cheese?
302,DILLON,302,"Satisfied?  Now let's get the hell
out..."
303,DILLON,303,What is God's name...?
304,SCHAEFER,304,Mac!
305,SCHAEFER,305,"Get Ramirez on his feet!  Take
the girl and get the hell out
of here!"
306,DILLON,306,"No way, Dutch.  I'm going.
You get these people and get
the hell out of here."
307,SCHAEFER,307,"This isn't your style, Dillon."
308,DILLON,308,"Guess I've picked up some bad
habits from you, Dutch.  Now
don't argue with me, you know
I'm right.  Get to that
chopper and hold it for us.
We'll be along."
309,SCHAEFER,309,"You know you can't win this
one."
310,DILLON,310,"You know me, Dutch, I never
did know when to quit."
311,SCHAEFER,311,Dillon!
312,SCHAEFER,312,I'll see you there.
313,DILLON,313,Right behind you.
314,BILLY,314,"He's busted up, bad, Major."
315,RAMIREZ,315,"I can make it, Major."
316,SCHAEFER,316,"Come on, Poncho, we're getting
out of here."
317,SCHAEFER,317,"Billy, take the radio, leave
the rest.  Come on!"
318,MAC,318,"Come on, you motherfucker!"
319,VOICE,319,"Dillon, over here."
320,VOICE,320,"Dillon, over here."
321,DILLON,321,Mac?
322,MAC,322,"Out there.  Past the rocks...
can you see it?"
323,DILLON,323,I see it!
324,DILLON,324,We're gonna take this thing.
325,DILLON,325,"Take a position over there.
I'll work around towards you.
When I flush him, you nail
him..."
326,MAC,326,"...Right, I got a score to
settle for the Bro..."
327,DILLON,327,We both got scores to settle.
328,DILLON,328,Mac...Mac.
329,SCHAEFER,329,Billy!!!
330,SCHAEFER,330,Billy!!!
331,SCHAEFER,331,"Get back, into the rocks!"
332,SCHAEFER,332,Run!  Get to the chopper!
333,SCHAEFER,333,You couldn't see me.
334,SCHAEFER,334,"One chance, that's all."
335,ANNA'S VOICE,335,"Look out, behind you!!!"
336,ANNA'S VOICE,336,"...Look out, behind you!"
337,SCHAEFER,337,Anna...?
338,SCHAEFER,338,Anna...?
339,HUNTER,339,"Dillon, over here..."
340,SCHAEFER,340,"Bleed, you bastard."
341,SCHAEFER,341,Who the hell are you...?
342,HUNTER,342,Who...
343,HUNTER,343,...the hell...
344,HUNTER,344,...are...
345,HUNTER,345,...You?
346,PILOT,346,"Holy, fuck, what was
that...?!!!"
347,PHILIPS,347,Orbit right...check it out!
348,ANNA,348,NOOOOOO!!!!!!
349,MEDIC,349,"Looks like he's been through
hell...can't believe he's
still alive.  What the hell
went on down there?"
350,PHILIPS,350,"If it hadn't been for her, he'd
be dead now.  That story she
told us...I still can't believe
it."
