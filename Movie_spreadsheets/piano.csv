0,ADA (VO - Scs 2 to 7),0,"The voice you hear is not my
speaking voice, but my mind's
voice.
I have not spoken since I was
six years old. No one knows
why, not even me. My father
says it is a dark talent and
the day I take it into my head
to stop breathing will be my
last.
Today he married me to a man
I've not yet met. Soon my
daughter and I shall join him
in his own country. My husband
said my muteness does not
bother him. He writes and hark
this: God loves dumb creatures,
so why not he!
Were good he had God's patience
for silence affects everyone in
the end. The strange thing is I
don't think myself silent, that
is, because of my piano. I
shall miss it on the journey."

too few of us here to carry it.

in Luxemburg."

conducted the Royal Orchestra."
75,AUNT MORAG,75,"(frowning) And where did they
get married?"
76,FLORA,76,"(her Scottish accent becomes
thick and expressive) In an
enormous forest, with real
fairies as bridesmaids each
holding a little elf's hand."
77,FLORA,77,"No, I tell a lie, it was in a
small country church, near the
mountains"
78,AUNT MORAG,78,Which mountains are those dear?
79,FLORA,79,The Alps.
80,AUNT MORAG,80,"Ohhh I've never been there.

in German and her voice would
echo across the valleys
That was before the
accident...."
82,AUNT MORAG,82,Oh what happened?
83,FLORA,83,"One day when my mother and
father were singing together in
the forest, a great storm blew
up out of nowhere. But so
passionate was their singing
that they did not notice, nor
did they stop as the rain began
to fall and when their voices
rose for the final bars of the
duet a great bolt of lightening
came out of the sky and struck
my father so that he lit up
like a torch... And at the same
moment my father was struck
dead my mother was struck dumb!
She- never-spoke-another-word."
84,AUNT MORAG,84,"Ohhh ... dear. Not another word
From the shock, yes it would
be."
85,AUNT MORAG,85,Terrible.  Terrible
86,STEWART,86,"I shall be gone for some days.
There is some Maori land I want
and may buy very reasonably.
(STEWART shuffles) I am hoping
you will use the time to settle
in, and, in some ways we may
start again"
87,STEWART,87,All right?
88,BAINES,88,I'm not able to read.
89,FLORA,89,"Please take us to the beach
where we landed."

I don't have the time.

can't do it."

93,FLORA,93,Hello.
94,AUNT MORAG,94,"(looking carefully at STEWART)
Well you stopped combing your
hair, which is a good thing, it
was looking over done.
(without pause but referring to
the sheet) You see these are
the slits that the heads will
go through, show him Nessie ...
they'll be dead, the Reverend
is going to use animal blood,
no doubt it will be very
dramatic. Tea!
(for NESSIE rather than to her)"
95,NESSIE,95,It will be very dramatic.
96,STEWART,96,"(sitting down)
What would you think if someone
played a kitchen table like it
were a piano?"
97,AUNT MORAG,97,Like it were a piano?
98,STEWART,98,"It's strange isn't it? I mean
it's not a piano, it doesn't
make any sound."
99,AUNT MORAG,99,"(hissing to NESSIE) Biscuits.'
No, no sound."
100,STEWART,100,"I knew she was mute, but now
I'm thinking it's more than
that. I'm wondering if she's
not brain affected."
101,AUNT MORAG,101,No sound at all?
102,STEWART,102,"No, it was a table."
103,AUNT MORAG,103,"(musing) Well, she was very
violent with the gown. She tore
off a chunk of lace. if hadn't
been there I'd have sworn she'd
used her teeth"
104,NESSIE,104,and wiped her feet an it.
105,STEWART,105,"Well it has not yet come to
anything. Just a concern."
106,AUNT MORAG,106,"Oh, yes, yes of course, a
concern."
107,STEWART,107,"There is something to be said
for silence"
108,AUNT MORAG,108,Oh indeed. Cotton'.
109,STEWART,109,"(warming)  And with time she
will, I'm sure, become
affectionate."
110,AUNT MORAG,110,"Certainly, there is nothing so
easy to like as a pet and they
are quite silent."
111,BAINES,111,"Those 80 acres, that cross the
stream, what do you think of
them?"
112,STEWART,112,On your property?
113,BAINES,113,Yes
114,STEWART,114,"Good, flatish land with
reliable water, why? I don't
have money. What are you about?"
115,BAINES,115,I'd like to make a swap.
116,STEWART,116,What for?
117,BAINES,117,The piano.
118,STEWART,118,"The piano on the beach? Ada's
piano?"
119,STEWART,119,It's not marshy is it?
120,BAINES,120,No.
121,STEWART,121,"You'd have to organise it up
here."
122,BAINES,122,"Yes, I thought that."
123,STEWART,123,"Well Baines the music lover, I
never would have known. Hidden
talents George."
124,BAINES,124,"I'll have to get lessons. It
wouldn't be much use without
them."
125,STEWART,125,"Yes, I suppose you would."
126,STEWART,126,Well Ada can play.
127,STEWART,127,"I have it in a letter she plays
well. She's been playing since
she was 5 or6."
128,STEWART,128,"I have got us some excellent
land. Baines has taken some
queer idea to have a piano, and
you are to give him lessons.
Have you taught before?"
129,FLORA,129,What on?
130,STEWART,130,"On your piano, that is the
swap."
131,STEWART,131,What does she say?
132,FLORA,132,"She says it's her piano, and
she won't have him touch it.
He's an oaf, he can't read,
he's ignorant."
133,STEWART,133,"He wants to improve himself...
and you will be able to play on
it ... (ADA is not responding
well) Teach him to look after
it."
134,STEWART,134,"NO! NO! THE PIANO IS MINE! IT'S
MINE!"
135,STEWART,135,"(getting up) You can't go on
like this, we are a family now,
all of us make sacrifices and
so will you.
You will teach him. I shall see
to that!"
136,STEWART,136,"HiM na ake 'nun na'.
(Lift up the back)"
137,STEWART,137,"Tern - tern!
(Ass hole!)
Hei niti niti maan!
(turning around)
You lick it.)"
138,STEWART,138,"I'd try children's tunes,
nothing more complicated"
139,STEWART,139,Just be encouraging no one expects him to be good.
140,STEWART,140,"(lifting the lid) It looks
good, very nice looking thing.
Well . I wish you luck. The girls
are very excited about the
lessons."
141,STEWART,141,"Flora will explain anything Ada says.
They talk through their fingers,
you can't believe what they say
with just their hands."
142,FLORA,142,"My mother wants to see your
hands. Hold them out."
143,FLORA,143,"No, no, like this"
144,FLORA,144,You have to wash them.
145,BAINES,145,They are washed.
146,FLORA,146,Wash them again.
147,BAINES,147,"The marks do not come out.
They are scars and hardened
skin."
148,FLORA,148,"There's no tune left in the
piano so she can't teach you."
149,BLIND MAN,149,"Ah, a Broadbent. A fine
instrument. I've not come
across one here, or in the
Islands where I have tuned some
200. Yes, they like their
pianos there."
150,BLIND MAN,150,Scent? And salt of course.
151,BLIND MAN,151,"What will you play when it's
tuned? What music do you play?"
152,BAINES,152,I can't play.
153,BLIND MAN,153,You don't play?
154,BAINES,154,"No, I can't.
I'm going to learn."
155,BLIND MAN,155,"Well my dear Miss Broadbent,
tuned, but silent."
156,FLORA,156,"Mother says she can't stand to
teach piano with it all out or
tune. So I'm to do scales."
157,FLORA,157,"I hope you've scrubbed your
hands."
158,FLORA,158,"Oh, it's in tune."
159,FLORA,159,What's out there?
160,FLORA,160,"You have to watch me where I
put my fingers."
161,FLORA,161,It's in tune.
162,FLORA,162,(Hissing) I was teaching.
163,FLORA,163,"She wants to see what you can
do."
164,BAINES,164,"I'd rather not play. I want to
listen and learn that way."
165,FLORA,165,Everyone has to practice.
166,BAINES,166,I just want to listen.
167,FLORA,167,What do you want to hear?
168,BAINES,168,Anything.
169,FLORA,169,Tell me about my real father.
170,FLORA,170,How did you speak to him?
171,ADA (subtitled),171,"I didn't need to speak, I could
lay thoughts out in his mind
like they were a sheet"
172,FLORA,172,"What happened? Why didn't you
get married?"
173,ADA cont.,173,"After a while he became
frightened and he stopped
listening."
174,STEWART,174,Shall I kiss you goodnight?
175,BAINES,175,"Do you know how to bargain, nod
if you do."
176,BAINES,176,"There's a way you can have your
piano back. Do you want it
back? You want it back?"
177,BAINES,177,"You see I'd like us to make a
deal. There's things I want to
do while you stay. If you let
me you can earn it back.
What do you think, one visit
for every key."
178,BAINES,178,Your dress?
179,BAINES,179,Skirt ...?
180,BAINES,180,For every black one?
181,BAINES,181,"That's a lot less, half."
182,BAINES,182,"All right, all right then, the
black keys."
183,BAINES,183,It's better that you play.
184,BAINES,184,Play... Keep playing.

260,STEWART,260,"(Quietly to BAINES)
Offer the guns."
261,MAORI NEGOTIATOR,261,"Kahore atu he kororo. Kahore
niaton Kote hake whentia. Engad

(No more talk, we won't sell
the land. I will trade you
pigs, that is all.)"
262,STEWART,262,"Never behave like that, never
any where. You are greatly
shamed and you have shamed
those trunks. (trees)"
263,STEWART,263,"What o'clock say Mr Stewart?
-Ge Tupeka?
(got tobacco?)
-Time for puff puff."
264,FLORA,264,"(sulkily) I know why Mr. Baines
can't play the piano."
265,STEWART,265,You've missed this bit.
266,FLORA,266,She never gives him a turn.
267,FLORA,267,"She just plays whatever she
pleases, sometimes she doesn't
play at all."
268,STEWART,268,And when is the next lesson?
269,FLORA,269,Tomorrow.
270,BAINES,270,"I am giving the piano back to
you. I've had enough.  The
arrangement is making you a
whore and me wretched.
I want you to care for me, but
you can't."
271,HIRA,271,"(softly) George, can I use this
comb?"
272,BAINES,272,"It's yours, leave, go on go!"
273,STEWART,273,"(stiffly from some distance)
Stop right there'. This isn't
yours  what are you doing with
the piano?"
274,FLORA,274,He's given it to us.
275,STEWART,275,"(out of breath) Hah, you're
very cunning Ada, but I've seen
through you, I'm not going to
lose the land this way. Wait
here!"
276,HIRA,276,"George sick, he don't wanna see
nobody. You got Tupeka for the
Hira?"
277,STEWART,277,"I don't think you should have
given up the piano. I will make
sure you are properly taught,
with music written on to sheets
and..."
278,BAINES,278,I don't want to learn.
279,STEWART,279,You don't want to learn.
280,BAINES,280,No.
281,STEWART,281,"And what does this do to our
bargain? I cannot afford the
piano if you mean me to pay."
282,BAINES,282,"No, no payment. I have given it
back. I don't want it."
283,STEWART,283,"Well, I doubt I want it very
much myself."
284,BAINES,284,"It was more to your wife that I
gave it."
285,STEWART,285,"Well, thank you, I expect she
will appreciate it."
286,STEWART,286,So that is agreed on?
287,HIRA,287,"You make BIG mistake George. In
first place you should swap
land for wife. Now look, she
gone, you no land, no music
box, you got nothing."
288,STEWART,288,"Is it all right? Aren't you
going to play something?"
289,FLORA,289,To HELL!
290,BAINES,290,"So what brings you here? Did
you leave something? I have not
found anything."
291,BAINES,291,Does he know something?
292,BAINES,292,"The piano is not harmed? It
arrived safely? Would you like
to sit? I am going to sit."
293,BAINES,293,"Ada, I am unhappy because I
want you, because my mind has
seized on you and thinks of
nothing else. This is how I
suffer, I am sick with longing.
I don't eat, I don't sleep. If
you do not want me, if you have
come with no feeling for me,
then go!"
294,BAINES,294,Go! Go NOW! Leave!
295,BAINES,295,What?  What?  whisper....
296,BAINES,296,"Now you are going I am
miserable, why is that? (He
catches her hand and draws her
to hint) Ada I need to know,
what will you do? Will you come
again?"
297,BAINES,297,"Wait! I don't know what you're
thinking. (gently, teasingly)
Does this mean something to
you? Hey? (Stroking a strand of
hair behind her ear) I already
miss you. Ada, do you love me?"
298,BAINES,298,"(anxiously) Come tomorrow. If
you are serious, come tomorrow."
299,BAINES,299,Tomorrow?
300,FLORA,300,"Stay still! It's the very worst
knots."
301,FLORA,301,Mama STOP IT!
302,FLORA,302,Stop it I feel sick!
303,FLORA,303,"(TOP OF HER LUNGS) Mumma!
Mumma! They are playing your
piano!"
304,FLORA,304,Here Papa!
305,FLORA,305,"You shouldn't have gone up
there, should you? I don't like
it and nor does Papa. Mama, we
can play cards together."
306,FLORA,306,"She is asleep, look."
307,STEWART,307,"You are letting the clothes
float off... They are floating
off."
308,FLORA,308,Mama! Look out!
309,FLORA,309,"One, two, three
One, two, three"
310,STEWART,310,Ada!
311,AUNT MORAG,311,"Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a
dank cave."
312,NESSIE,312,"Yes, like a cave."
313,AUNT MORAG,313,"Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!"
314,AUNT MORAG,314,"Alisdair, is it because of our
play? Have the natives
aggressed you?"
315,NESSIE,315,"(nodding her head in imitation)
... you are quite trapped."
316,AUNT MORAG,316,"We have just come from George
Banes' and they have taken him
over. It is no wonder he is
leaving, he has got in too deep
with the natives. They sit on
his floor as proud as Kings,
but without a shred of manners."
317,NESSIE,317,"(in unison) ... without a shred
of manners."
318,AUNT MORAG,318,"He is quite altered, as if they
had been trying some native
witchcraft on him. Well
tomorrow or the day after he
will be gone."
319,STEWART,319,Baines is packing up?
320,AUNT MORAG,320,"Well he has NOTHING to pack,
but he is leaving. And it is
just as well; Nessie has
foolishly grown an affection
for him ... we have had some
tears"
321,AUNT MORAG,321,(very firmly) STOP IT! STOP!
322,AUNT MORAG,322,"I am quite frightened of the
way back, we must leave in good
light. Will we be safe?"
323,STEWART,323,"(wanting them gone) If you
leave soon, yes, I am sure of
it."
324,AUNT MORAG,324,"You know I am thinking of the
piano. She does not play the
piano as we do Nessie."
325,AUNT MORAG,325,"UP! UP! No she is a strange
creature and her saying is
strange like a mood that passes
into you. You cannot teach that
Nessie, one may like to learn
but that could not be taught."
326,AUNT MORAG,326,"Up! Your playing is plain and
true and that is what I like.
To have a sound creep inside
you is not all pleasant"
327,AUNT MORAG,327,what is that?
328,NESSIE,328,(frightened) Ohhhhhh!
329,MARY/HENI,329,"(slow, relaxed) A pid-geon
Auntie."
330,STEWART,330,"I've been hoping you would
come."
331,STEWART,331,"I want to touch you Why can't I
touch you? Do you like me?"
332,STEWART,332,Do you?
333,STEWART,333,Why? Why not?!
334,STEWART,334,"(Clears his throat) We must
both get on. I have decided to
trust you to stay here. You
will not see Baines?
(ADA nods) Good, good. Perhaps
with more trying you will come
to like me?"
335,STEWART,335,No!
336,FLORA,336,"We're not supposed to visit
him'."
337,FLORA,337,"The grand old Duke of York. He
had ten thousand men etc."
338,FLORA,338,"Mumma wanted me to give this to
Mr. Baines."
339,FLORA,339,"I thought maybe it was not a
proper thing to do."
340,FLORA,340,Shall I open it?
341,STEWART,341,No!!
342,MANA,342,"Knare e Wainta! Kaare e Wajata!

343,STEWART,343,"(exasperated) why? WHY? I
trusted you!"
344,STEWART,344,WHY?
345,STEWART,345,"I trusted you, do you hear? I
trusted you. I could love you."
346,STEWART,346,"Why do you do this? Why do you
make me hurt you? Do you bear?
Why have you done it? We could
be happy"
347,STEWART,347,You have made me angry. SPEAK!!
348,STEWART,348,"You shall answer for this.
Speak or not you shall answer for
it!"
349,STEWART,349,"(anguished) Do you love him? Do
you?! Is it him you love?"
350,FLORA,350,"No, she says NOOOOOO!!!"
351,FLORA,351,(Screaming) Mother!!
352,FLORA,352,Mama!
353,FLORA,353,(quietly) Mama.
354,STEWART,354,"Take this to Baines. Tell him
if he ever tries to see her again
I'll take off another and another
and another!"
355,HIRA,355,"I worry for us Peini. Pakeha
cunning like wind, KNOCK you
over, yet you not see it. Some
they say, how can pakeha get
our land if we won't sell it?"""
356,HIRA,356,"They wrong Peini. We need guns
to hold it."
357,HIRA,357,"(angrily)I worried Feini.
What's gonna happen you, you go
home, but where we go? We got
nowhere to go."

403,STEWART,403,"You broke my trust, you pushed
me hard, to hard. (he sighs)
You cannot send love to HIM you
cannot do it.  Even to think on
it makes me angry, very angry"
404,STEWART,404,"I meant to love you. I clipped
your wing, that is all."

see it will be better..."

408,STEWART,408,You are feeling better?
409,STEWART,409,What...?
410,STEWART,410,"Put that away, on the floor."
411,STEWART,411,"I look at you, at your face. I
have had that face in my head
hating it. But now I am here
seeing it ... it's nothing, you
blink, you have your mark, you
look at me through your eyes,
yes. you are even scared of me"
412,STEWART,412,Look at you!
413,STEWART,413,"(softly)
Has Ada ever spoken to you?"
414,BAINES,414,You mean in signs?
415,STEWART,415,"No, words. You have never heard
words?"
416,BAINES,416,"No, not words."
417,STEWART,417,Never thought you heard words?
418,STEWART,418,"(slowly)
She has spoken to me. I heard
her voice. There was no sound,
but I beard it here (he presses
his forehead with a palm of his
hand). Her voice was there in
my head. I watched her lips,
they did not make the words,
yet the harder I listened the
clearer I heard her, as clear
as I hear you, as dear as I
hear my own voice."
419,BAINES,419,"(trying to understand)
Spoken words?"
420,STEWART,420,"No, but her words are in my
head. (he looks at BAINES and
pauses) I know what you think,
that it's a trick, that I'm
making it up. No, the words I
heard, were her words."
421,BAINES,421,(suspiciously) What are they?
422,STEWART,422,"She said, ""I have to go, let me
go, let Baines take me away,
let him try and save me. I am
frightened of my will, of what
it might do it is so strange
and strong""."
423,BAINES,423,"You punished her wrongly, it
was me, my fault."
424,STEWART,424,"Understand me. I am here for
her, for her I wonder that I
don't wake, that I am not
asleep to be here talking with
you. I love her. But what is
the use? She doesn't care for
me. I wish her gone. I wish you
gone. I want to wake and find
it was a dream, that is what I
want. I want to believe I am
not this man. I want my self
back; the one I know."
425,HIRA,425,I worry for you.
426,BAINES,426,"No, I love her, we will be a
family. I have her piano. I
will mend it, she will get
better."
