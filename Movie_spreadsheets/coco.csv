0,0,MIGUEL (V.O.),0,"Sometimes I think I'm cursed...
'cause of something that happened
before I was even born."
1,1,MIGUEL (V.O.),1,"See, a long time ago there was this
family."
2,2,MIGUEL (V.O.),2,"The papá, he was a musician."
3,3,MIGUEL (V.O.),3,"He and his family would sing, and
dance, and count their blessings..."
4,4,MIGUEL (V.O.),4,"But he also had a dream... to play
for the world."
5,5,MIGUEL (V.O.),5,"And one day he left with his
guitar... and never returned."
6,6,MIGUEL (V.O.),6,"And the mamá...? She didn't have
time to cry over that walkaway
musician!"
7,7,MIGUEL (V.O.),7,"After banishing all music from her
life..."
8,8,MIGUEL (V.O.),8,"She found a way to provide for her
daughter..."
9,9,MIGUEL (V.O.),9,"She rolled up her sleeves and she
learned to make shoes."
10,10,MIGUEL (V.O.),10,She could have made candy!
11,11,MIGUEL (V.O.),11,Or fireworks!
12,12,MIGUEL (V.O.),12,Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!
13,13,MIGUEL (V.O.),13,But no... she chose shoes...
14,14,MIGUEL (V.O.),14,"Then she taught her daughter to
make shoes. And later, she taught
her son-in-law."
15,15,MIGUEL (V.O.),15,"Then her grandkids got roped in.
As her family grew, so did the
business."
16,16,MIGUEL (V.O.),16,"Music had torn her family apart,
but shoes held them all together."
17,17,MIGUEL (V.O.),17,"You see, that woman was my great-
great grandmother, Mamá Imelda."
18,18,MIGUEL (V.O.),18,"She died WAY before I was born.
But my family still tells her story
every year on Día de los Muertos --
the Day of the Dead..."
19,19,MIGUEL (V.O.),19,And her little girl?
20,20,MIGUEL (V.O.),20,"She's my great grandmother, Mamá
Coco."
21,21,MIGUEL,21,"Holá, Mamá Coco."
22,22,MAMÁ COCO,22,"How are you, Julio?"
23,23,MIGUEL (V.O.),23,"Actually, my name is Miguel. Mamá
Coco has trouble remembering
things... But it's good to talk to
her anyway. So I tell her pretty
much everything."
24,24,MIGUEL,24,I used to run like this...
25,25,MIGUEL,25,"But now I run like this which is
way faster!"
26,26,MIGUEL,26,"And the winner is... Luchadora
Coco!"
27,27,MIGUEL,27,"I have a dimple on this side, but
not on this side. Dimple. No
dimple. Dimple. No dimple--"
28,28,ABUELITA,28,Miguel!   Eat your food.
29,29,MIGUEL (V.O.),29,"My Abuelita? She's Mamá Coco's
daughter."
30,30,ABUELITA,30,"Aw, you're a twig, mijo.         Have some
more."
31,31,MIGUEL,31,"No, gracias."
32,32,ABUELITA,32,"I asked if you would like more
tamales."
33,33,MIGUEL,33,S-sí?
34,34,ABUELITA,34,That's what I THOUGHT you said.
35,35,MIGUEL (V.O.),35,"Abuelita runs our house just like
Mamá Imelda did."
36,36,ABUELITA,36,No music!
37,37,ABUELITA,37,No music!!
38,38,MUSICIANS,38,AUNQUE LA VIDA--
39,39,ABUELITA,39,NO MUSIC!!!
40,40,MIGUEL (V.O),40,"I think we're the only family in
México who hates music..."
41,41,MIGUEL (V.O.),41,And my family's fine with that...
42,42,MIGUEL (V.O.),42,But me?
43,43,MAMÁ,43,"Be back by lunch, mijo!"
44,44,MIGUEL,44,"Love you, Mamá!"
45,45,MIGUEL (V.O.),45,"I am NOT like the rest of my
family..."
46,46,WOMAN,46,"Hola, Miguel!"
47,47,MIGUEL,47,Hola!
48,48,MIGUEL,48,Muchas gracias!
49,49,STREET VENDOR,49,"De nada, Miguel!"
50,50,MIGUEL,50,"Hey, hey!    Dante!"
51,51,MIGUEL,51,"Sit. Down. Roll over.        Shake.
Fist bump."
52,52,MIGUEL,52,"Good boy, Dante!"
53,53,MIGUEL (V.O),53,"I know I'm not supposed to love
music -- but it's not my fault!"
54,54,MIGUEL (V.O),54,It's his: Ernesto de la Cruz...
55,55,MIGUEL (V.O),55,"...The greatest musician of all
time."
56,56,TOUR GUIDE,56,"And right here, in this very plaza,
the young Ernesto de la Cruz took
his first steps toward becoming the
most beloved singer in Mexican
history!"
57,57,MIGUEL (V.O.),57,"He started out a total nobody from
Santa Cecilia, like me. But when
he played music, he made people
fall in love with him."
58,58,MIGUEL (V.O.),58,"He starred in movies. He had the
coolest guitar... He could fly!"
59,59,MIGUEL (V.O.),59,"And he wrote the best songs! But
my all-time favorite? It's--"
60,60,DE LA CRUZ,60,"REMEMBER ME
THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE
REMEMBER ME
DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY
FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY
I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART
I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU
EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART
REMEMBER ME"
61,61,DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D),61,"THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR
REMEMBER ME
EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD GUITAR
KNOW THAT I'M WITH YOU THE ONLY WAY
THAT I CAN BE..."
62,62,MIGUEL (V.O.),62,"He lived the kind of life you dream
about... Until 1942..."
63,63,DE LA CRUZ,63,"UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN
REMEMBER ME!"
64,64,MIGUEL (V.O.),64,"When he was crushed by a giant
bell."
65,65,MIGUEL (V.O),65,I wanna be just like him.
66,66,MIGUEL (V.O.),66,"Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and
I get this feeling... like we're
connected somehow. Like, if HE
could play music, maybe someday I
could too..."
67,67,MIGUEL (CONT'D),67,...If it wasn't for my family.
68,68,PLAZA MARIACHI,68,"Ay, ay, ay, muchacho."
69,69,MIGUEL,69,Huh?
70,70,PLAZA MARIACHI,70,"I asked for a shoe shine, not your
life story."
71,71,MIGUEL,71,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
72,72,MIGUEL,72,"I just can't really talk about any
of this at home so..."
73,73,PLAZA MARIACHI,73,"Look, if I were you I'd march right
up to my family and say, ""Hey! I'm
a musician. Deal with it!"""
74,74,MIGUEL,74,I could never say that...
75,75,PLAZA MARIACHI,75,"You ARE a musician, no?"
76,76,MIGUEL,76,"I don't know. I mean... I only
really play for myself--"
77,77,PLAZA MARIACHI,77,"Did de la Cruz become the world's
best musician by hiding his sweet,
sweet skills? No! He walked out
onto that plaza and he played out
loud!"
78,78,PLAZA MARIACHI (CONT'D),78,"Ah, mira, mira! They're setting up
for tonight. The music competition
for Día de Muertos. You wanna be
like your hero? You should sign
up!"
79,79,MIGUEL,79,"Uh-uh, my family would freak!"
80,80,PLAZA MARIACHI,80,"Look, if you're too scared, then,
well... have fun making shoes."
81,81,PLAZA MARIACHI (CONT'D),81,"C'mon.    What did de la Cruz always
say?"
82,82,MIGUEL,82,...Seize your moment?
83,83,PLAZA MARIACHI,83,"Show me what you got, muchacho.
I'll be your first audience."
84,84,ABUELITA (O.S.),84,MIGUEL!
85,85,MIGUEL,85,Abuelita!
86,86,ABUELITA,86,What are you doing here?
87,87,MIGUEL,87,Um...uh...
88,88,ABUELITA,88,You leave my grandson alone!
89,89,PLAZA MARIACHI,89,"Doña, please -- I was just getting
a shine!"
90,90,ABUELITA,90,"I know your tricks, mariachi!"
91,91,ABUELITA,91,What did he say to you?
92,92,MIGUEL,92,"He was just showing me his
guitar..."
93,93,TÍO BERTO,93,Shame on you!
94,94,ABUELITA,94,"My grandson is a sweet little
angelito querido cielito -- he
wants no part of your music,
mariachi! You keep away from him!"
95,95,ABUELITA,95,"Ay, pobrecito! Estás bien, mijo?"
96,96,ABUELITA,96,"You know better than to be here in
this place! You will come home.
Now."
97,97,TÍO BERTO,97,"How many times have we told you --
that plaza is crawling with
mariachis!"
98,98,MIGUEL,98,"Yes, Tío Berto."
99,99,MIGUEL,99,"No, no, no!"
100,100,ABUELITA,100,"Go away, you! Go!"
101,101,MIGUEL,101,It's just Dante...
102,102,ABUELITA,102,"Never name a street dog.         They'll
follow you forever."
103,103,ABUELITA,103,"Now, go get my shoe."
104,104,ABUELITA,104,I found your son in Mariachi Plaza!
105,105,PAPÁ,105,Miguel...
106,106,MAMÁ,106,"You know how Abuelita feels about
the plaza."
107,107,MIGUEL,107,I was just shining shoes!
108,108,TÍO BERTO,108,A musician's shoes!
109,109,MIGUEL,109,"But the plaza's where all the foot
traffic is."
110,110,PAPÁ,110,"If Abuelita says no more plaza,
then no more plaza."
111,111,MIGUEL,111,But what about tonight?
112,112,PAPÁ FRANCO,112,What's tonight?
113,113,MIGUEL,113,"Well they're having this talent
show-"
114,114,MIGUEL,114,And I thought I might...
115,115,MAMÁ,115,...Sign up?
116,116,MIGUEL,116,"Well, maybe?"
117,117,PRIMA ROSA,117,"You have to have talent to be in a
talent show."
118,118,PRIMO ABEL,118,"What are YOU going to do, shine
shoes?"
119,119,ABUELITA,119,"It's Día de los Muertos -- no one's
going anywhere. Tonight is about
family."
120,120,ABUELITA,120,Ofrenda room. Vámonos.
121,121,ABUELITA,121,"Don't give me that look. Día de
los Muertos is the one night of the
year our ancestors can come visit
us."
122,122,ABUELITA,122,"We've put their photos on the
ofrenda so their spirits can cross
over. That is very important! If
we don't put them up, they can't
come!"
123,123,ABUELITA,123,"We made all this food -- set out
the things they loved in life,
mijo. All this work to bring the
family together. I don't want you
sneaking off to who-knows-where."
124,124,ABUELITA (CONT'D),124,Where are you going?
125,125,MIGUEL,125,I thought we were done...
126,126,ABUELITA,126,"Ay, Dios mío... Being part of this
family means being HERE for this
family... I don't want to see you
end up like--"
127,127,MIGUEL,127,Like Mamá Coco's papá?
128,128,ABUELITA,128,"Never mention that man!      He's
better off forgotten."
129,129,MIGUEL,129,But you're the one who--
130,130,ABUELITA,130,"Ta, ta, ta-tch!"
131,131,MIGUEL,131,I was just--
132,132,ABUELITA,132,Tch-tch!
133,133,MIGUEL,133,But--
134,134,ABUELITA,134,Tch!
135,135,MIGUEL,135,I--
136,136,ABUELITA,136,Tch-tch!
137,137,MAMÁ COCO,137,Papá?
138,138,MAMÁ COCO (CONT'D),138,Papá is home...?
139,139,ABUELITA,139,"Mamá, cálmese, cálmese."
140,140,MAMÁ COCO,140,Papá is coming home?
141,141,ABUELITA,141,"No Mamá.   It's okay, I'm here."
142,142,MAMÁ COCO,142,Who are you?
143,143,ABUELITA,143,"Rest, Mamá."
144,144,ABUELITA (CONT'D),144,"I'm hard on you because I care,
Miguel."
145,145,ABUELITA (CONT'D),145,Miguel... Miguel?
146,146,ABUELITA (CONT'D),146,"What are we going to do with that
boy...?"
147,147,ABUELITA (CONT'D),147,"You're right. That's just what he
needs!"
148,148,MIGUEL,148,"Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon,
Dante. Hurry up."
149,149,MIGUEL (CONT'D),149,"You're gonna get me in trouble,
boy. Someone could hear me!"
150,150,MIGUEL (CONT'D),150,I wish someone wanted to hear me...
151,151,MIGUEL (CONT'D),151,Other than you...
152,152,MIGUEL (CONT'D),152,Perfecto!
153,153,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),153,"I have to sing. I have to play.
The music, it's -- it's not just in
me. It is me."
154,154,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),154,"When life gets me down, I play my
guitar."
155,155,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),155,"The rest of the world may follow
the rules, but I must follow my
heart!"
156,156,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),156,"You know that feeling? Like
there's a song in the air and it's
playing just for you..."
157,157,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),157,"A FEELING SO CLOSE
YOU COULD REACH OUT AND TOUCH IT
I NEVER KNEW I COULD
WANT SOMETHING SO MUCH
BUT IT'S TRUE..."
158,158,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),158,"You must have faith, sister."
159,159,NUN (FILM CLIP),159,"Oh but Padre, he will never listen."
160,160,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),160,He will listen... to MUSIC!
161,161,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),161,"ONLY A SONG
ONLY A SONG
HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE A HEART..."
162,162,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),162,"Never underestimate the power of
music..."
163,163,LOLA (FILM CLIP),163,"But my father, he will never give
his permission."
164,164,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),164,"I am done asking permission. When
you see your moment you mustn't let
it pass you by, you must seize it!"
165,165,INTERVIEWER (FILM CLIP),165,"Señor de la Cruz, what did it take
for you to seize your moment?"
166,166,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),166,"I had to have faith in my dream.
No one was going to hand it to me.
It was up to me to reach for that
dream, grab it tight, and make it
come true."
167,167,MIGUEL,167,...and make it come true.
168,168,MIGUEL,168,"No more hiding, Dante.      I gotta
seize my moment!"
169,169,MIGUEL (CONT'D),169,"I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if
it kills me!"
170,170,ABUELITA,170,Día de los Muertos has begun!
171,171,MAMÁ,171,"No, no, no, no, no."
172,172,MAMÁ (CONT'D),172,"We have to make a clear path. The
petals guide our ancestors home. We
don't want their spirits to get
lost. We want them to come, and
enjoy all the food and drinks on
the ofrenda, sí?"
173,173,PAPÁ,173,"Mamá, where should we put this
table?"
174,174,ABUELITA,174,"In the courtyard, mijos."
175,175,PAPÁ,175,You want it down by the kitchen?
176,176,ABUELITA,176,Sí.   Next to the other one.
177,177,MIGUEL,177,"Get under, get under!"
178,178,ABUELITA (O.S.),178,Miguel!
179,179,MIGUEL,179,Nothing!
180,180,MIGUEL (CONT'D),180,"Mamá -- Papá, I--"
181,181,PAPÁ,181,Miguel...
182,182,PAPÁ,182,"Your Abuelita had the most
wonderful idea!"
183,183,PAPÁ,183,"We've all decided -- it's time you
joined us in the workshop!"
184,184,MIGUEL,184,What?!
185,185,PAPÁ,185,"No more shining shoes -- you will
be making them! Every day after
school!"
186,186,ABUELITA,186,"Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on
the family tradition! And on Día
de los Muertos! Your ancestors
will be so proud!"
187,187,ABUELITA (CONT'D),187,"You'll craft huaraches just like
your Tía Victoria."
188,188,PAPÁ,188,"And wingtips, like your Papá Julio--"
189,189,MIGUEL,189,"But what if I'm no good at making
shoes?"
190,190,PAPÁ,190,"Ah, Migue... You have your family
here to guide you..."
191,191,PAPÁ,191,"You are a Rivera. And a Rivera
is...?"
192,192,MIGUEL,192,"...A shoemaker. Through and
through."
193,193,PAPÁ,193,That's my boy!
194,194,PAPÁ,194,"Berto, break out the good stuff, I
wanna make a toast!"
195,195,MIGUEL,195,"Dante!   No, Dante, stop!"
196,196,MIGUEL (CONT'D),196,"No, no, no, no, no! No..."
197,197,MIGUEL,197,De la Cruz's guitar...?
198,198,MAMÁ COCO,198,Papá?
199,199,MAMÁ COCO (CONT'D),199,Papá?
200,200,MIGUEL,200,"Mamá Coco, is your papá... Ernesto
de la Cruz?"
201,201,MAMÁ COCO,201,Papá!   Papá!
202,202,MIGUEL,202,"Ha, ha!"
203,203,MIGUEL,203,Papá!   Papá!
204,204,MIGUEL (CONT'D),204,"It's him! I know who my great-
great grandfather was!"
205,205,MAMÁ,205,Miguel!   Get down from there!
206,206,MIGUEL,206,"Mamá Coco's father was Ernesto de
la Cruz!"
207,207,PAPÁ,207,What are you talking about?
208,208,MIGUEL,208,I'm gonna be a musician!
209,209,ABUELITA,209,"What is all this? You keep secrets
from your own family?"
210,210,TÍO BERTO,210,"It's all that time he spends in the
plaza..."
211,211,TÍA GLORIA,211,"...Fills his head with crazy
fantasies!"
212,212,MIGUEL,212,It's not a fantasy!
213,213,MIGUEL (CONT'D),213,"That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!
The greatest musician of all time!"
214,214,PAPÁ,214,"We've never known anything about
this man. But whoever he was, he
still abandoned his family. This
is no future for my son."
215,215,MIGUEL,215,"But Papá, you said my family would
guide me! Well de la Cruz IS my
family! I'm supposed to play
music!"
216,216,ABUELITA,216,"Never!    That man's music was a
curse!    I will not allow it!"
217,217,MIGUEL,217,If you would just let--
218,218,MAMÁ,218,Miguel--
219,219,PAPÁ,219,"You will listen to your family.    No
more music."
220,220,MIGUEL,220,Just listen to me play--
221,221,PAPÁ,221,End of argument.
222,222,ABUELITA,222,"You want to end up like that man?
Forgotten? Left off your family's
ofrenda?!"
223,223,MIGUEL,223,"I don't care if I'm on some stupid
ofrenda!"
224,224,MIGUEL,224,No!
225,225,PAPÁ,225,Mamá...
226,226,ABUELITA,226,"There. No guitar, no music."
227,227,ABUELITA (CONT'D),227,"Come. You'll feel better after you
eat with your family."
228,228,MIGUEL,228,I don't wanna be in this family!
229,229,PAPÁ,229,Miguel!   MIGUEL!
230,230,MIGUEL,230,"I wanna play in the plaza. Like de
la Cruz! Can I still sign-up?"
231,231,STAGE MANAGER,231,You got an instrument?
232,232,MIGUEL,232,No... But if I can borrow a guitar--
233,233,STAGE MANAGER,233,"Musicians gotta bring their own
instruments..."
234,234,STAGE MANAGER,234,"You find a guitar, kid, I'll put
you on the list."
235,235,MIGUEL,235,"Excuse me, can I borrow your
guitar?"
236,236,MUSICIAN #1,236,"Sorry, muchacho."
237,237,MIGUEL,237,You guys have a spare guitar?
238,238,MUSICIAN #2,238,No.
239,239,MIGUEL,239,"I need a guitar, just for a little
bit--"
240,240,MUSICIAN #3,240,"Get outta here, kid!"
241,241,MIGUEL,241,"Great-great grandfather... What am
I supposed to do?"
242,242,MIGUEL,242,"No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop!
Cállate! Shhh!"
243,243,MIGUEL,243,I'm sorry...
244,244,MIGUEL,244,"Señor de la Cruz? Please don't be
mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great
grandson... I need to borrow this."
245,245,MIGUEL (CONT'D),245,"Our family thinks music is a curse.
None of them understand, but I know
you would have. You would've told
me to follow my heart. To seize my
moment!"
246,246,MIGUEL (CONT'D),246,"So if it's all right with you, I'm
gonna play in the plaza, just like
you did!"
247,247,VOICES (O.S.),247,"The guitar! It's gone! Somebody
stole de la Cruz's guitar! The
window's broken, look."
248,248,GROUNDSKEEPER,248,"Alright, who's in there?"
249,249,MIGUEL,249,"I... I'm sorry! It's not what it
looks like! De la Cruz is my..."
250,250,GROUNDSKEEPER,250,There's nobody here!
251,251,MAMÁ,251,Miguel!
252,252,MIGUEL,252,Mamá!
253,253,PAPÁ,253,Miguel!   Come home!
254,254,PAPÁ,254,"Where are you, Miguel?!"
255,255,WOMAN,255,"Dios mío!    Little boy, are you
okay?"
256,256,WOMAN (CONT'D),256,"Here, let me help you."
257,257,MIGUEL,257,"Thanks, I--"
258,258,SKELETON HEAD,258,Do you mind?
259,259,MIGUEL,259,Ahhh!
260,260,SKELETON HEAD,260,Ahhh!
261,261,MIGUEL,261,AHHH!
262,262,SKELETON ABUELA,262,Look how big she's getting!
263,263,MIGUEL,263,"Dante?! You can see me?          W-wait!
What's going on?!"
264,264,MIGUEL,264,Dante!    Dante!
265,265,MIGUEL,265,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
266,266,PAPÁ JULIO,266,Miguel?!
267,267,TÍA ROSITA,267,Miguel?
268,268,TÍA VICTORIA,268,Miguel?
269,269,PAPÁ JULIO,269,You're here! HERE here!
270,270,PAPÁ JULIO (CONT'D),270,And you can see us?!
271,271,TÍA ROSITA,271,Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-ti-to!
272,272,MIGUEL,272,Remind me how I know you?
273,273,TÍA ROSITA,273,"We're your family, mijo!"
274,274,MIGUEL,274,Tía... Rosita?
275,275,TÍA ROSITA,275,Sí!
276,276,MIGUEL,276,Papá Julio?
277,277,PAPÁ JULIO,277,Hola.
278,278,MIGUEL,278,Tía Victoria?
279,279,TÍA VICTORIA,279,He doesn't seem entirely dead.
280,280,TÍA ROSITA,280,He's not quite alive either...
281,281,PAPÁ JULIO,281,"We need Mamá Imelda. She'll know
how to fix this!"
282,282,TÍO FELIPE,282,"(huffing)
Oye!"
283,283,TÍO OSCAR,283,It's Mamá Imelda--
284,284,TÍO FELIPE,284,--She couldn't cross over!
285,285,TÍO OSCAR,285,She's stuck--
286,286,TÍO FELIPE,286,--On the other side!
287,287,MIGUEL,287,Tío Oscar?     Tío Felipe?
288,288,TÍO OSCAR,288,"Oh, hey Miguel."
289,289,TÍA VICTORIA,289,"I have a feeling this has something
to do with you."
290,290,TÍA ROSITA,290,"But if Mamá Imelda can't come to
us..."
291,291,PAPÁ JULIO,291,"...Then we are going to her!
Vámonos!"
292,292,MIGUEL,292,Whoa...
293,293,PAPÁ JULIO,293,"Come on, Miguel. It's ok."
294,294,MIGUEL,294,"Dante!   Dante! Dante, wait up!"
295,295,MIGUEL (CONT'D),295,"You gotta stay with me, boy.       We
don't know... where..."
296,296,MIGUEL,296,"This isn't a dream, then.        You're
all really out there..."
297,297,TÍA VICTORIA,297,You thought we weren't?
298,298,MIGUEL,298,"Well I don't know, I thought it
might've been one of those made up
things that adults tell kids...
like... vitamins."
299,299,TÍA VICTORIA,299,"Miguel, vitamins are a real thing."
300,300,MIGUEL,300,"Well, now I'm thinking maybe they
could be..."
301,301,SKELETON MOTHER,301,"Mija, it's not nice to stare at--"
302,302,SKELETON MOTHER,302,Ay! Santa Maria!
303,303,MIGUEL,303,"Are those...? Alebrijes!         But
those are--"
304,304,TÍO OSCAR,304,"REAL alebrijes. Spirit
creatures..."
305,305,TÍA ROSITA,305,"They guide souls on their
journey..."
306,306,TÍO FELIPE,306,"Watch your step, they make caquitas
everywhere."
307,307,CANNED LOOP (V.O.),307,"Welcome back to the Land of the
Dead. Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry. We hope you
enjoyed your holiday!"
308,308,ARRIVALS AGENT,308,Welcome back! Anything to declare?
309,309,TRAVELER,309,Some churros... from my family.
310,310,ARRIVALS AGENT,310,How wonderful! Next!
311,311,CANNED LOOP (V.O.),311,"...If you are experiencing travel
issues, agents at the Department of
Family Reunions are available to
assist you."
312,312,DEPARTURES AGENT,312,"Next family, please!"
313,313,DEPARTURES AGENT (CONT'D),313,"Oh, your photos are on your son's
ofrenda. Have a great visit!"
314,314,ELDERLY COUPLE,314,Gracias.
315,315,CANNED LOOP (V.O.),315,"...And remember to return before
sunrise. Enjoy your visit!"
316,316,DEPARTURES AGENT,316,Next!
317,317,DEPARTURES AGENT (CONT'D),317,"Your photo's on your dentist's
ofrenda. Enjoy your visit!"
318,318,JUAN ORTODONCIA,318,Grashiash!
319,319,DEPARTURES AGENT,319,Next!
320,320,HÉCTOR,320,"Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo."
321,321,HÉCTOR,321,"Shall we skip the scanner? I'm on
so many ofrendas, it'll just
overwhelm your blinky thingie..."
322,322,DEPARTURES AGENT,322,"Well shoot. Looks like no one put
up your photo, Frida..."
323,323,HÉCTOR,323,"Okay, when I said I was Frida...
just now? That... that was a lie.
And I apologize for doing that."
324,324,DEPARTURES AGENT,324,"No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing
the bridge."
325,325,HÉCTOR,325,"You know what, I'm just gonna zip
right over, you won't even know I'm
gone."
326,326,HÉCTOR,326,Ha HA!
327,327,HÉCTOR,327,"Almost there, just a little
further...!"
328,328,OFFICER,328,Upsy-daisy...
329,329,HÉCTOR,329,"Fine, okay. Fine, who cares...
Dumb flower bridge!"
330,330,TÍA ROSITA,330,"I don't know what I'd do if no one
put up my photo."
331,331,ARRIVALS AGENT (O.S.),331,Next!
332,332,TÍA ROSITA,332,"Oh!   Come mijo, it's our turn."
333,333,ARRIVALS AGENT,333,"Welcome back, amigos! Anything to
declare?"
334,334,PAPÁ JULIO,334,"As a matter of fact, yes."
335,335,MIGUEL,335,Hola.
336,336,VOICE OVER P.A.,336,"Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos. Marta
Gonzales-Ramos, please report to
Level 7."
337,337,MIGUEL,337,Whoa...
338,338,TÍO OSCAR,338,I miss my nose...
339,339,DISTRESSED TRAVELER,339,"C'mon! Help us out amigo... We
gotta get to a dozen ofrendas
tonight..."
340,340,MIFFED WIFE,340,"We are NOT visiting your ex-wife's
family for Día de Muertos!"
341,341,MAMÁ IMELDA,341,"I demand to speak to the person in
charge!"
342,342,CASE WORKER,342,"I'm sorry, señora, it says here no
one put up your photo--"
343,343,MAMÁ IMELDA,343,"My family always -- ALWAYS -- puts
my photo on the ofrenda! That
devil box tells you nothing but
lies!"
344,344,PAPÁ JULIO,344,Mamá Imelda?
345,345,MAMÁ IMELDA,345,"Oh, mi familia! They wouldn't let
me cross the bridge! Tell this
woman and her devil box that my
photo is on the ofrenda."
346,346,PAPÁ JULIO,346,"Well, we never made it to the
ofrenda..."
347,347,MAMÁ IMELDA,347,What?!
348,348,PAPÁ JULIO,348,We ran into... um...
349,349,MAMÁ IMELDA,349,Miguel?
350,350,MIGUEL,350,Mamá Imelda...
351,351,MAMÁ IMELDA,351,What is going on?
352,352,CLERK,352,You the Rivera family?
353,353,CLERK,353,"Well, you're cursed."
354,354,MIGUEL,354,What?!
355,355,CLERK,355,"Día de los Muertos is a night to
GIVE to the dead. You STOLE from
the dead."
356,356,MIGUEL,356,But I wasn't stealing the guitar!
357,357,MAMÁ IMELDA,357,Guitar...?
358,358,MIGUEL,358,"It was my great-great
grandfather's, he would have wanted
me to have it--"
359,359,MAMÁ IMELDA,359,"Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak of
that..."
360,360,MAMÁ IMELDA,360,"...musician! He is DEAD to this
family!"
361,361,MIGUEL,361,"Uh, you're all dead."
362,362,CLERK,362,"ACHOO! I am sorry, whose alebrije
is that?"
363,363,MIGUEL,363,That's just Dante.
364,364,TÍA ROSITA,364,"He sure doesn't look like an
alebrije."
365,365,TÍO OSCAR,365,"He just looks like a plain old
dog..."
366,366,TÍO FELIPE,366,"...Or a sausage someone dropped in
a barbershop."
367,367,CLERK,367,"Whatever he is, I am -- ACHOO! --
terribly allergic."
368,368,MIGUEL,368,But Dante doesn't have any hair.
369,369,CLERK,369,"And I don't have a nose, and yet
here we are -- ACHOO!!"
370,370,MAMÁ IMELDA,370,"But none of this explains why I
couldn't cross over."
371,371,MIGUEL,371,Oh...
372,372,MAMÁ IMELDA,372,You took my photo off the ofrenda?!
373,373,MIGUEL,373,It was an accident!
374,374,MAMÁ IMELDA,374,How do we send him back?!
375,375,CLERK,375,"Well, since it's a family matter..."
376,376,CLERK,376,"The way to undo a family curse is
to get your family's blessing."
377,377,MIGUEL,377,That's it?
378,378,CLERK,378,"Get your family's blessing, and
everything SHOULD go back to
normal. But you gotta do it by
sunrise!"
379,379,MIGUEL,379,What happens at sunrise?
380,380,PAPÁ JULIO,380,Híjole!   Your hand!
381,381,PAPÁ JULIO,381,"Whoa, Miguel. Can't have you
fainting on us."
382,382,CLERK,382,"But not to worry! Your family's
here, you can get your blessing
right now."
383,383,CLERK,383,"Cempasúchil, cempasúchil.        Aha!
Perdón, señora."
384,384,CLERK,384,"Now, you look at the living and say
his name."
385,385,MAMÁ IMELDA,385,Miguel.
386,386,CLERK,386,"Nailed it.     Now say: I give you my
blessing."
387,387,MAMÁ IMELDA,387,I give you my blessing.
388,388,MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D),388,"I give you my blessing to go
home..."
389,389,MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D),389,"To put my photo back on the
ofrenda..."
390,390,MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D),390,And to never play music again!
391,391,MIGUEL,391,What?   She can't do that!
392,392,CLERK,392,"Well technically she can add any
conditions she wants."
393,393,MIGUEL,393,Fine.
394,394,CLERK,394,Then you hand the petal to Miguel.
395,395,MIGUEL,395,No skeletons!
396,396,MIGUEL,396,"Mariachi Plaza, here I come--"
397,397,MAMÁ IMELDA,397,"Two seconds and you already break
your promise!"
398,398,MIGUEL,398,"This isn't fair, it's my life!     You
already had yours!"
399,399,MIGUEL,399,"Papá Julio, I ask for your
blessing."
400,400,MIGUEL (CONT'D),400,"Tía Rosita? Oscar? Felipe?       Tía
Victoria?"
401,401,MAMÁ IMELDA,401,"Don't make this hard, mijo.      You go
home my way, or no way."
402,402,MIGUEL,402,You really hate music that much?
403,403,MAMÁ IMELDA,403,"I will not let you go down the same
path he did."
404,404,MIGUEL,404,The same path he did.
405,405,MIGUEL (CONT'D),405,He's family...
406,406,TÍA VICTORIA,406,Listen to your Mamá Imelda.
407,407,TÍO OSCAR,407,She's just looking out for you.
408,408,TÍA ROSITA,408,Be reasonable.
409,409,MIGUEL,409,"Con permiso, I... need to visit the
restroom. Be right back!"
410,410,CLERK,410,"Uh, should we tell him there are no
restrooms in the Land of the Dead?"
411,411,MIGUEL,411,Vámonos.
412,412,PATROLWOMAN,412,"We got a family looking for a
LIVING BOY."
413,413,MIGUEL,413,"If I wanna be a musician, I need a
MUSICIAN'S blessing. We gotta find
my great-great grandpa."
414,414,PATROLMAN,414,"Hold it, muchacho."
415,415,PATROLMAN,415,Ahh!
416,416,PATROLMAN,416,I've found that living boy!
417,417,PATROLMAN,417,"Uh whoa, excuse me, excuse me
folks! Excuse me--"
418,418,MIGUEL,418,"No, no -- Dante!"
419,419,CORRECTIONS OFFICER,419,"...disturbing the peace, fleeing an
officer, falsifying a unibrow..."
420,420,HÉCTOR,420,That's illegal?
421,421,CORRECTIONS OFFICER,421,"VERY illegal. You need to clean up
your act, amigo."
422,422,HÉCTOR,422,Amigo?
423,423,HÉCTOR,423,"Oh, that's so nice, to hear you say
that, because..."
424,424,HÉCTOR,424,"I've just had a really hard Día de
Muertos, and I could really use an
amigo right now."
425,425,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),425,"And amigos, they help their amigos.
Listen, you get me across that
bridge tonight and I'll make it
worth your while."
426,426,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),426,"Oh, you like de la Cruz? He and I
go way back! I can get you front
row seats to his Sunrise
Spectacular Show!"
427,427,CORRECTIONS OFFICER,427,Uh--
428,428,HÉCTOR,428,"I'll -- I'll get you backstage, you
can meet him!"
429,429,HÉCTOR,429,"You just gotta let me cross that
bridge!"
430,430,CORRECTIONS OFFICER,430,"I should lock you up for the rest
of the holiday..."
431,431,CORRECTIONS OFFICER,431,"But my shift's almost up, and I
wanna visit my living family... so
I'm letting you off with a warning."
432,432,HÉCTOR,432,Can I at least get my costume back?
433,433,CORRECTIONS OFFICER,433,"Uh, no."
434,434,HÉCTOR,434,Some amigo...
435,435,MIGUEL,435,"Hey. Hey!     You really know de la
Cruz?"
436,436,HÉCTOR,436,Who wants to--
437,437,HÉCTOR,437,Ah! You're alive!
438,438,MIGUEL,438,Shhh!
439,439,MIGUEL (CONT'D),439,"Yeah I'm alive. And if I wanna get
back to the Land of the Living, I
need de la Cruz's blessing."
440,440,HÉCTOR,440,That's weirdly specific.
441,441,MIGUEL,441,He's my great-great-grandfather.
442,442,HÉCTOR,442,He's your wha-whaat...?
443,443,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),443,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait..."
444,444,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),444,"Wait, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait?"
445,445,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),445,"Yes! You're going back to the Land
of the Living?!"
446,446,MIGUEL,446,"D'ya know what, maybe this isn't
such a g--"
447,447,HÉCTOR,447,"No, niño, niño, niño, I can help
you! You can help me. We can help
each other! But most importantly,
you can help ME."
448,448,MAMÁ IMELDA,448,Miguel!
449,449,MIGUEL,449,AH!
450,450,HÉCTOR,450,I'm Héctor.
451,451,MIGUEL,451,That's nice!
452,452,HÉCTOR,452,Espérame chamaco!
453,453,MAMÁ IMELDA,453,"Ay, he is going to get himself
killed... I need my spirit guide,
Pepita."
454,454,MAMÁ IMELDA,454,Who has that petal Miguel touched?
455,455,PAPÁ JULIO,455,Here!
456,456,PAPÁ JULIO,456,Nice alebrije...
457,457,HÉCTOR,457,"Hey, hey, hold still."
458,458,HÉCTOR,458,"Look up. Look up. A ver, a ver...
look up. Up, UP!... Ta-da!"
459,459,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),459,Dead as a doorknob.
460,460,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),460,"So listen, Miguel: this place runs
on memories. When you're well-
remembered, people put up your
photo and you get to cross the
bridge and visit the living on Día
de Muertos."
461,461,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),461,Unless you're me.
462,462,MIGUEL,462,You don't get to cross over.
463,463,HÉCTOR,463,No one's ever put up my picture...
464,464,HÉCTOR,464,But you can change that!
465,465,MIGUEL,465,This is you?
466,466,HÉCTOR,466,"Muy guapo, eh?"
467,467,MIGUEL,467,"So you get me to my great-great
grandpa, then I put up your photo
when I get home?"
468,468,HÉCTOR,468,"Such a smart boy! Yes! Great
idea, yes!"
469,469,HÉCTOR,469,"One hiccup: de la Cruz is a tough
guy to get to. And I need to cross
that bridge soon. Like TONIGHT."
470,470,HÉCTOR,470,"So, you got any other family here,
you know? Someone a bit more...
accessible?"
471,471,MIGUEL,471,"Mmm, nope."
472,472,HÉCTOR,472,"Don't yank my chain, chamaco.      You
gotta have SOME other family."
473,473,MIGUEL,473,"ONLY de la Cruz. If you can't help
me, I'll find him myself."
474,474,HÉCTOR,474,"Okay, okay, kid, fine -- fine!
I'll get you to your great-great
grandpa...!"
475,475,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),475,"...It's not gonna be easy, you
know? He's a busy man."
476,476,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),476,What are you doing?
477,477,MIGUEL,477,"I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in."
478,478,HÉCTOR,478,"No, skeletons don't walk like that."
479,479,MIGUEL,479,It's how you walk.
480,480,HÉCTOR,480,"No, I don't."
481,481,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),481,Stop it!
482,482,MIGUEL,482,"Whoa...""Ernesto de la Cruz's
Sunrise Spectacular...!"" Qué
padre!"
483,483,HÉCTOR,483,"Blech. Every year, your great-
great grandpa puts on that dumb
show to mark the end of Día de
Muertos."
484,484,MIGUEL,484,And you can get us in!
485,485,HÉCTOR,485,Ahhhh--
486,486,MIGUEL,486,"Hey, you said you had front row
tickets!"
487,487,HÉCTOR,487,"That... that was a lie.      I
apologize for that."
488,488,HÉCTOR,488,"Cool off, chamaco, come on... I'll
get you to him."
489,489,MIGUEL,489,How?
490,490,HÉCTOR,490,"'Cause I happen to know where he's
rehearsing!"
491,491,CECILIA,491,"You better have my dress, Héctor!"
492,492,HÉCTOR,492,"Hola, Ceci!"
493,493,MIGUEL,493,Hola.
494,494,HÉCTOR,494,"Ceci, I lost the dress--"
495,495,CECILIA,495,"Ya lo sabía! I gotta dress forty
dancers by sunrise and thanks to
you, I'm one Frida short of an
opening number!"
496,496,HÉCTOR,496,"Ceci -- I know, Ceci. I know, I
know. Ceci -- Ceci... Ceci.
Ceci..."
497,497,MIGUEL,497,Dante... Dante!
498,498,MIGUEL,498,We shouldn't be in here...
499,499,MIGUEL,499,"No, no, Dante! Ven acá!"
500,500,FRIDA,500,You!    How did you get in here?
501,501,MIGUEL,501,I just followed my--
502,502,FRIDA,502,"Oh, the mighty Xolo dog...! Guider
of wandering spirits...!"
503,503,FRIDA,503,"And whose spirit have you guided to
me?"
504,504,MIGUEL,504,I don't think he's a spirit guide.
505,505,FRIDA,505,"Ah-ah-ah. The alebrijes of this
world can take many forms... They
are as mysterious as they are
powerful..."
506,506,FRIDA (CONT'D),506,"Or maybe he's just a dog.        Come!    I
need your eyes!"
507,507,FRIDA,507,You are the audience.
508,508,FRIDA,508,"Darkness. And from the darkness...
A giant PAPAYA!"
509,509,FRIDA,509,"Dancers emerge from the papaya and
the dancers are all me!"
510,510,FRIDA (CONT'D),510,"And they go to drink from the milk
of their mother who is a cactus,
but who is also me. And her milk
is not milk but tears."
511,511,FRIDA (CONT'D),511,Is it too obvious?
512,512,MIGUEL,512,"I think it's just the right amount
of obvious?"
513,513,MIGUEL,513,"It could use some music... Oh!
What if you did, like, doonk-doonk-
doonk-doonk..."
514,514,MIGUEL (CONT'D),514,"Oh! And then it could go dittle-
ittle-dittle-ittle-dittle-ittle-
dittle-ittle -- WHAAA!"
515,515,FRIDA,515,"And... what if everything was on
fire? Yes! Fire everywhere!"
516,516,FRIDA,516,Inspired!
517,517,FRIDA,517,"You... you have the spirit of an
artist!"
518,518,FRIDA,518,"The dancers exit, the music fades,
the lights go out! And Ernesto de
la Cruz rises to the stage!"
519,519,MIGUEL,519,Huh?
520,520,FRIDA,520,"He does a couple of songs, the sun
rises, everyone cheers--"
521,521,MIGUEL,521,"Excuse me, where's the real de la
Cruz?"
522,522,FRIDA,522,"Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals.
He's too busy hosting that fancy
party at the top of his tower."
523,523,HÉCTOR,523,"Chamaco! You can't run off on me
like that! C'mon, stop pestering
the celebrities..."
524,524,MIGUEL,524,"You said my great-great grandpa
would be here! He's halfway across
town, throwing some big party."
525,525,HÉCTOR,525,"That bum! Who doesn't show up to
his own rehearsal?"
526,526,MIGUEL,526,"If you're such good friends, how
come he didn't invite you?"
527,527,HÉCTOR,527,"He's YOUR great-great grandpa.   How
come he didn't invite YOU?"
528,528,HÉCTOR,528,"Hey Gustavo! You know anything
about this party?"
529,529,GUSTAVO,529,"It's the hot ticket. But if you're
not on the guest list you're never
getting in, Chorizo..."
530,530,MUSICIANS,530,"Hey, it's Chorizo! / Choricito!"
531,531,HÉCTOR,531,"Ha ha, very funny guys.      Very
funny."
532,532,MIGUEL,532,Chorizo?
533,533,GUSTAVO,533,"Oh, this guy's famous! Go on, go
on, ask him how he died!"
534,534,HÉCTOR,534,I don't want to talk about it.
535,535,GUSTAVO,535,He choked on some CHORIZO!
536,536,HÉCTOR,536,"I didn't choke, okay -- I got food
poisoning, which is a big
difference!"
537,537,HÉCTOR,537,"This is why I don't like
musicians... bunch of self-
important jerks!"
538,538,MIGUEL,538,"Hey, I'm a musician."
539,539,HÉCTOR,539,You are?
540,540,GUSTAVO,540,"Well, if you really want to get to
Ernesto, there IS that music
competition at the Plaza de la
Cruz. Winner gets to play at his
party..."
541,541,HÉCTOR,541,"No, no, no, chamaco, you are loco
if you think--"
542,542,MIGUEL,542,"I need to get my great-great
grandfather's blessing."
543,543,MIGUEL (CONT'D),543,You know where I can get a guitar?
544,544,HÉCTOR,544,I know a guy...
545,545,MAMÁ IMELDA,545,"Have you found him, Pepita?      Have
you found our boy?"
546,546,TÍA ROSITA,546,A footprint!
547,547,PAPÁ JULIO,547,It's a Rivera boot!
548,548,TÍO OSCAR,548,Size seven...
549,549,TÍO FELIPE,549,...and a half.
550,550,TÍA VICTORIA,550,Pronated.
551,551,MAMÁ IMELDA,551,Miguel.
552,552,HÉCTOR,552,"Why the heck would you wanna be a
musician?"
553,553,MIGUEL,553,"My great-great grandpa was a
musician."
554,554,HÉCTOR,554,"...Who spent his life performing
like a monkey for complete
strangers. Blech, no, no thank
you, guácala, no..."
555,555,MIGUEL,555,Whadda you know?
556,556,MIGUEL,556,"So, how far is this guitar anyway?"
557,557,HÉCTOR,557,We're almost there...
558,558,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),558,"Keep up, chamaco, come on!"
559,559,RATTY GROUP,559,COUSIN HÉCTOR!!
560,560,HÉCTOR,560,Eh!   These guys!
561,561,RATTY MEMBER,561,HÉCTOR!!
562,562,HÉCTOR,562,Hey Tío!   Qué onda!
563,563,MIGUEL,563,These people are all your family?
564,564,HÉCTOR,564,"Eh, in a way... We're all the ones
with no photos or ofrendas, no
family to go home to. Nearly
forgotten, you know?"
565,565,HÉCTOR,565,"So, we all call each other cousin,
or tío, or whatever."
566,566,TÍA CHELO,566,Héctor!
567,567,HÉCTOR,567,Tía Chelo!     He-hey!
568,568,OLD TIAS,568,Muchas gracias!
569,569,HÉCTOR,569,"Hey, hey! Save some for me!      Is
Chicharrón around?"
570,570,TÍA CHELO,570,"In the bungalow. I don't know if
he's in the mood for visitors..."
571,571,HÉCTOR,571,"Who doesn't like a visit from
Cousin Héctor?"
572,572,HÉCTOR,572,"Buenas noches, Chicharrón!"
573,573,CHICHARRÓN,573,"I don't want to see your stupid
face, Héctor."
574,574,HÉCTOR,574,"C'mon, it's Día de Muertos! I
brought you a little offering!"
575,575,CHICHARRÓN,575,Get out of here...
576,576,HÉCTOR,576,"I would, Cheech, but the thing
is... me and my friend, Miguel, we
really need to borrow your guitar."
577,577,CHICHARRÓN,577,My guitar?!
578,578,HÉCTOR,578,Yes?
579,579,CHICHARRÓN,579,"My prized, beloved guitar...?"
580,580,HÉCTOR,580,"I promise we'll bring it right
back."
581,581,CHICHARRÓN,581,"Like the time you promised to bring
back my van?"
582,582,HÉCTOR,582,Uh...
583,583,CHICHARRÓN,583,Or my mini-fridge?
584,584,HÉCTOR,584,"Ah, you see­-"
585,585,CHICHARRÓN,585,"Or my good napkins? My lasso?    My
femur?!"
586,586,HÉCTOR,586,"No, no, not like those times."
587,587,CHICHARRÓN,587,Where's my femur?! You--
588,588,HÉCTOR,588,"Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo?"
589,589,CHICHARRÓN,589,"I'm fading, Héctor. I can feel it."
590,590,CHICHARRÓN,590,"I couldn't even play that thing if
I wanted to."
591,591,CHICHARRÓN,591,You play me something.
592,592,HÉCTOR,592,"You know I don't play anymore,
Cheech. The guitar's for the kid--"
593,593,CHICHARRÓN,593,"You want it, you got to earn it..."
594,594,HÉCTOR,594,"Only for you, amigo.     Any requests?"
595,595,CHICHARRÓN,595,"You know my favorite, Héctor."
596,596,HÉCTOR,596,"WELL EVERYONE KNOWS JUANITA,
HER EYES EACH A DIFFERENT COLOR.
HER TEETH STICK OUT,
AND HER CHIN GOES IN,
AND HER..."
597,597,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),597,...KNUCKLES THEY DRAG ON THE FLOOR.
598,598,CHICHARRÓN,598,Those aren't the words!
599,599,HÉCTOR,599,There are children present.
600,600,HÉCTOR,600,"HER HAIR IS LIKE A BRIAR,
SHE STANDS IN A BOW-LEGGED STANCE.
AND IF I WEREN'T SO UGLY,
SHE'D POSSIBLY GIVE ME A CHANCE!"
601,601,CHICHARRÓN,601,Brings back memories.     Gracias...
602,602,MIGUEL,602,Wait... what happened?
603,603,HÉCTOR,603,He's been forgotten.
604,604,HÉCTOR,604,"When there's no one left in the
living world who remembers you, you
disappear from this world. We call
it the ""Final Death."""
605,605,MIGUEL,605,Where did he go?
606,606,HÉCTOR,606,No one knows.
607,607,MIGUEL,607,"But I've met him... I could
remember him, when I go back..."
608,608,HÉCTOR,608,"No, it doesn't work like that,
chamaco. Our memories... they have
to be passed down by those who knew
us in life -- in the stories they
tell about us. But there's no one
left alive to pass down Cheech's
stories..."
609,609,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),609,"Hey, it happens to everyone
eventually."
610,610,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),610,"C'mon ""de la Cruzcito."" You've got
a contest to win."
611,611,MIGUEL,611,"You told me you hated musicians,
you never said you were one."
612,612,HÉCTOR,612,"How do you think I knew your great-
great grandpa? We used to play
music together. Taught him
everything he knows."
613,613,MIGUEL,613,"No manches! You played with
Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest
musician of all time?"
614,614,HÉCTOR,614,"Ha-ha, you're funny! Greatest
eyebrows of all time maybe but his
music, eh, not so much."
615,615,MIGUEL,615,"You don't know what you're talking
about..."
616,616,HÉCTOR,616,Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz!
617,617,HÉCTOR,617,"Showtime, chamaco!"
618,618,VENDOR,618,Llévelo!   T-shirts!    Bobble-heads!
619,619,EMCEE,619,"Bienvenidos a todos!     Who's ready
for some música?"
620,620,EMCEE (CONT'D),620,"It's a battle of the bands, amigos!
The winner gets to play for the
maestro himself, Ernesto de la
Cruz, at his fiesta tonight!"
621,621,HÉCTOR,621,"That's our ticket, muchacho."
622,622,EMCEE,622,Let the competition begin!
623,623,HÉCTOR,623,"So what's the plan?     What are you
gonna play?"
624,624,MIGUEL,624,"Definitely ""Remember Me."""
625,625,HÉCTOR,625,"No, not that one.     No."
626,626,MIGUEL,626,"C'mon, it's his most popular song!"
627,627,HÉCTOR,627,"Ehck, it's too popular."
628,628,SKELETON MUSICIAN,628,"REMEMBER ME, THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR,
REMEMBER ME..."
629,629,OPERA SINGERS,629,"REMEMBER ME!
DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY!"
630,630,MIGUEL,630,"Um... what about ""Poco Loco?"""
631,631,HÉCTOR,631,Epa!   Now that's a song!
632,632,STAGEHAND,632,De la Cruzcito? You're on standby!
633,633,STAGEHAND,633,"Los Chachalacos, you're up next!"
634,634,CROWD,634,LOS CHACHALACOS!
635,635,HÉCTOR,635,"You always this nervous before a
performance?"
636,636,MIGUEL,636,"I don't know -- I've never
performed before."
637,637,HÉCTOR,637,"What?! You said you were a
musician!"
638,638,MIGUEL,638,I am!
639,639,MIGUEL,639,I mean I will be.     Once I win.
640,640,HÉCTOR,640,That's your plan?!
641,641,HÉCTOR,641,"No, no, no, no, no, you have to
win, Miguel. Your life LITERALLY
depends on you winning! AND YOU'VE
NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE?!"
642,642,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),642,I'll go up there--
643,643,MIGUEL,643,No!    I need to do this.
644,644,HÉCTOR,644,Why?
645,645,MIGUEL,645,"If I can't go out there and play
one song... how can I call myself a
musician?"
646,646,HÉCTOR,646,What does that matter?!
647,647,MIGUEL,647,"'Cuz I don't just want to get de la
Cruz's blessing. I need to prove
that... that I'm worthy of it."
648,648,HÉCTOR,648,"Oh. Oh, that's such a sweet
sentiment... at SUCH a bad time!"
649,649,HÉCTOR,649,"Okay... okay, okay, okay. Okay.
Okay."
650,650,HÉCTOR,650,Okay.
651,651,HÉCTOR,651,"Okay you wanna perform? Then
you've got to PERFORM!"
652,652,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),652,"First you have to loosen up.     Shake
off those nerves! Sáquenlo
sáquenlo, sáquenlo!"
653,653,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),653,Now gimme your best grito!
654,654,MIGUEL,654,My best grito?
655,655,HÉCTOR,655,"Come on, yell! Belt it out!
OOOOOOH HE-HE-HEY! Ha! Ah, feels
good! Okay... now you."
656,656,MIGUEL,656,Ah -- ah -- ayyyyy yaaaaayyyyay...
657,657,HÉCTOR,657,"Oh, c'mon kid..."
658,658,STAGEHAND,658,"De la Cruzcito, you're on now!"
659,659,HÉCTOR,659,"Miguel, look at me."
660,660,STAGEHAND,660,"Come on, let's go!"
661,661,HÉCTOR,661,"Hey!     Hey, look at me.
(beat)"
662,662,HÉCTOR (CONT'D),662,"You can do this. Grab their
attention and don't let it go!"
663,663,EMCEE (O.S.),663,"We have one more act, amigos!"
664,664,MIGUEL,664,Héctor...
665,665,HÉCTOR,665,"Make 'em listen, chamaco!        You got
this!"
666,666,EMCEE (O.S.),666,"Damas y caballeros! De la
Cruzcito!"
667,667,HÉCTOR,667,Arre papá!     Hey!
668,668,HÉCTOR,668,"What's he doing? Why isn't he
playing?"
669,669,AUDIENCE MEMBER (O.S.),669,Bring back the singing dogs!
670,670,MIGUEL,670,HAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAI!
671,671,MIGUEL,671,"WHAT COLOR IS THE SKY?
AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR
YOU TELL ME THAT IT'S RED
AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR
WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY SHOES?

UN POQUI-TI-TI-TO LOCO
THE WAY YOU KEEP ME GUESSING
I'M NODDING AND I'M YES-ING
I'LL COUNT IT AS A BLESSING
THAT I'M ONLY UN POCO LOCO..."
673,673,HÉCTOR,673,"No, no, no, no..."
674,674,MIGUEL,674,Not bad for a dead guy!
675,675,HÉCTOR,675,"You're not so bad yourself,
gordito! Eso!"
676,676,MAMÁ IMELDA,676,He's close. Find him.
677,677,HÉCTOR,677,"THE LOCO THAT YOU MAKE ME
IT IS JUST UN POCO CRAZY
THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE NOT MAKING..."
678,678,MIGUEL,678,THE LIBERTIES YOU'RE TAKING...
679,679,TÍO FELIPE/TÍO OSCAR,679,"We're looking for a living kid...
about 12?"
680,680,TÍA ROSITA,680,Have you seen a living boy?
681,681,TÍA ROSITA,681,HECTOR                               MIGUEL
682,682,HÉCTOR,682,"Hey, you did good!     I'm proud of
you! Eso!"
683,683,AUDIENCE,683,Otra!   Otra! Otra!
684,684,HÉCTOR,684,"Hey, where are you going?"
685,685,MIGUEL,685,We gotta get outta here.
686,686,HÉCTOR,686,"What, are you crazy?     We're about
to win this thing!"
687,687,EMCEE,687,"Damas y caballeros, I have an
emergency announcement."
688,688,EMCEE,688,"Please be on the lookout for a
living boy, answers to the name of
Miguel. Earlier tonight he ran
away from his family. They just
want to send him back to the Land
of the Living..."
689,689,EMCEE (O.S.),689,"...If anyone has information,
please contact the authorities."
690,690,HÉCTOR,690,"Wait, wait, wait! You said de la
Cruz was your ONLY family. The
ONLY person who could send you
home."
691,691,MIGUEL,691,"I do have other family, but--"
692,692,HÉCTOR,692,"You could have taken my photo back
this whole time?!"
693,693,MIGUEL,693,"--But they hate music!      I need a
musician's blessing!"
694,694,HÉCTOR,694,You lied to me!
695,695,MIGUEL,695,"Oh, you're one to talk!"
696,696,HÉCTOR,696,"Look at me. I'm being forgotten,
Miguel. I don't even know if I'm
gonna last the night!"
697,697,HÉCTOR,697,"I'm not gonna miss my one chance to
cross that bridge 'cause you want
to live out some stupid musical
fantasy!"
698,698,MIGUEL,698,It's not stupid.
699,699,HÉCTOR,699,I'm taking you to your family.
700,700,MIGUEL,700,Let go of me!
701,701,HÉCTOR,701,You'll thank me later--
702,702,MIGUEL,702,"You don't wanna help me, you only
care about yourself! Keep your
dumb photo!"
703,703,HÉCTOR,703,"No -- no, no, no!     No..."
704,704,MIGUEL,704,Stay away from me!
705,705,HÉCTOR,705,"Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?!
Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!"
706,706,MIGUEL,706,"Dante, cállate!"
707,707,MIGUEL (CONT'D),707,"No, Dante!     Stop it! He can't help
me!"
708,708,MIGUEL (CONT'D),708,"Dante, stop! Stop it! Leave me
alone! You're not a spirit guide,
you're just a dumb dog! Now get
out of here!"
709,709,CROWD MEMBERS,709,"It's him! / It's that living boy! /
I heard about him. / Look! / He's
alive! / The boy's alive."
710,710,MIGUEL,710,AAHH!
711,711,MAMÁ IMELDA,711,"This nonsense ends now, Miguel! I
am giving you my blessing and you
are going home!"
712,712,MIGUEL,712,I don't want your blessing!
713,713,MAMÁ IMELDA,713,Miguel!   Stop!
714,714,MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D),714,Come back!     Miguel!
715,715,MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D),715,I am trying to save your life!
716,716,MIGUEL,716,You're ruining my life!
717,717,MAMÁ IMELDA,717,What?
718,718,MIGUEL,718,"Music's the only thing that makes
me happy. And you, you wanna take
that away!"
719,719,MIGUEL,719,You'll never understand.
720,720,MAMÁ IMELDA,720,"Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE,
LLORONA... NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE..."
721,721,MIGUEL,721,I thought you hated music.
722,722,MAMÁ IMELDA,722,"Oh, I loved it."
723,723,MAMÁ IMELDA,723,"I remember that feeling, when my
husband would play, and I would
sing and nothing else mattered.
But when we had Coco, suddenly...
there was something in my life that
mattered more than music. I wanted
to put down roots. He wanted to
play for the world."
724,724,MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D),724,"We each made a sacrifice to get
what we wanted. Now you must make
a choice."
725,725,MIGUEL,725,But I don't wanna... pick sides!
726,726,MIGUEL,726,"Why can't you be on MY side?
That's what family's supposed to do
-- support you."
727,727,MIGUEL,727,But you never will.
728,728,SECURITY GUARD,728,Have a good time.
729,729,GUEST,729,"Oh, how exciting!"
730,730,SECURITY GUARD,730,Oh!  El Santo!
731,731,SECURITY GUARD,731,I'm a big fan.

hopeless..."
753,753,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),753,"You must have faith, sister."
754,754,NUN (FILM CLIP),754,"Oh but Padre, he will never listen."
755,755,DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP),755,He will listen... to MUSIC!

BRINGS ME JOY! ¡QUÉ ALEGRÍA!
FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE
AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA"
757,757,MIGUEL,757,"FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE
AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA"
758,758,MIGUEL & DE LA CRUZ,758,"FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE
AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA"
759,759,MIGUEL,759,FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANG--
760,760,DE LA CRUZ,760,"Are you all right, niño?"
761,761,DE LA CRUZ,761,"It's you... you, you are that boy,
the one who came from the Land of
the Living."
762,762,MIGUEL,762,You... know about me?
763,763,DE LA CRUZ,763,"You are all anyone has been talking
about! Why have you come here?"
764,764,MIGUEL,764,"I'm Miguel. Your great-great
grandson."
765,765,DE LA CRUZ,765,I... have a great-great grandson?
766,766,MIGUEL,766,"I need your blessing. So I can go
back home and be a musician, just
like you."
767,767,MIGUEL (CONT'D),767,"The rest of our family, they
wouldn't listen. But I... I hoped
you would?"
768,768,DE LA CRUZ,768,"My boy, with a talent like yours,
how could I not listen?"
769,769,DE LA CRUZ,769,I HAVE A GREAT-GREAT GRANDSON!
770,770,CROWD,770,"Look, it's Frida!"
771,771,HÉCTOR,771,"Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo."
772,772,SECURITY GUARD,772,"It is an honor, señora!"
773,773,HÉCTOR,773,Gracias...
774,774,DE LA CRUZ,774,"Hey Negrete! Infante! Have you
met my great-great-grandson?"
775,775,DE LA CRUZ,775,My great-great grandson!
776,776,DE LA CRUZ,776,"He's alive! And a musician to
boot!"
777,777,MIGUEL,777,"Dimple.   No dimple.      Dimple.   No
dimple."
778,778,DE LA CRUZ,778,No dimple!
779,779,DON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP),779,To our friendship!...
780,780,DE LA CRUZ,780,"You know, I did all my own stunts."
781,781,DE LA CRUZ,781,"All of this came from my amazing
fans in the Land of the Living!
They leave me more offerings than I
know what to do with!"
782,782,DE LA CRUZ,782,"Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed..."
783,783,MIGUEL,783,No -- it's all great.
784,784,DE LA CRUZ,784,But...?
785,785,MIGUEL,785,"It's just -- I've been looking up
to you my whole life. You're the
guy who actually did it! But..."
786,786,MIGUEL,786,"Did you ever regret it? Choosing
music over... everything else."
787,787,DE LA CRUZ,787,"It was hard. Saying goodbye to my
hometown. Heading off on my own..."
788,788,MIGUEL,788,Leaving your family?
789,789,DE LA CRUZ,789,"Sí. But I could not have done it
differently."
790,790,DE LA CRUZ,790,"One cannot deny who one is meant to
be. And you, my great-great
grandson, are meant to be a
musician!"
791,791,DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D),791,"You and I, we are artists, Miguel!
We cannot belong to one family.
The world is our family!"
792,792,DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D),792,"Ooo, the fireworks have begun!"
793,793,DE LA CRUZ,793,"Soon, the party will move across
town for my ""Sunrise Spectacular!"""
794,794,DE LA CRUZ,794,"Miguel, you must come to the show!
You will be my guest of honor!"
795,795,MIGUEL,795,You mean it?!
796,796,DE LA CRUZ,796,"Of course, my boy!"
797,797,MIGUEL,797,"I can't... I have to get home
before sunrise."
798,798,DE LA CRUZ,798,"Oh, I really do need to get you
home."
799,799,DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D),799,"It has been an honor. I am sorry
to see you go, Miguel. I hope you
die very soon."
800,800,DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D),800,You know what I mean.
801,801,DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D),801,Miguel. I give you my bles--
802,802,HÉCTOR (O.S.),802,"We had a deal, chamaco!"
803,803,DE LA CRUZ,803,"Who are you? What is the meaning
of this?"
804,804,DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D),804,"Oh, Frida!     I thought you couldn't
make it."
805,805,HÉCTOR,805,"You said you'd take back my photo.
You promised, Miguel."
806,806,DE LA CRUZ,806,"You know this, uh... man?"
807,807,MIGUEL,807,"I just met him tonight.      He told me
he knew you--"
808,808,DE LA CRUZ,808,Hé-- Héctor?
809,809,HÉCTOR,809,"Please Miguel, put my photo up."
810,810,DE LA CRUZ,810,"My friend... you're being
forgotten..."
811,811,HÉCTOR,811,And whose fault is that?
812,812,DE LA CRUZ,812,"Héctor, please--"
813,813,HÉCTOR,813,"Those were MY songs you took.     MY
songs that made YOU famous."
814,814,MIGUEL,814,W-What?
815,815,HÉCTOR,815,"If I'm being forgotten, it's
because you never told anyone that
I wrote them--"
816,816,MIGUEL,816,"That's crazy, de la Cruz wrote all
his own songs."
817,817,HÉCTOR,817,"You wanna tell him, or should I?"
818,818,DE LA CRUZ,818,"Héctor, I never meant to take
credit."
819,819,DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D),819,"We made a great team but -- you
died and I -- I only sang your
songs because I wanted to keep a
part of you alive."
820,820,HÉCTOR,820,"Oh, how generous."
821,821,MIGUEL,821,You really did play together...
822,822,HÉCTOR,822,"Look, I don't want to fight about
it. I just want you to make it
right. Miguel can put my photo up--"
823,823,DE LA CRUZ,823,Héctor...
824,824,HÉCTOR,824,"--And I can cross over the bridge.
I can see my girl."
825,825,HÉCTOR,825,"Ernesto... Remember the night I
left?"
826,826,DE LA CRUZ,826,That was a long time ago.
827,827,HÉCTOR,827,"We drank together and you told me
you would move heaven and earth for
your amigo. Well, I'm asking you
to now."
828,828,MIGUEL,828,"Heaven and earth?     Like in the
movie?"
829,829,HÉCTOR,829,What?
830,830,MIGUEL,830,"That's Don Hidalgo's toast... in
the de la Cruz movie, ""El Camino A
Casa."""
831,831,HÉCTOR,831,"I'm talking about my real life,
Miguel."
832,832,YOUNG DE LA CRUZ,832,"I can't do this without your songs,
Héctor--"
833,833,YOUNG HÉCTOR,833,"I'm going home, Ernesto."
834,834,YOUNG HÉCTOR,834,"Hate me if you want, but my mind is
made up."
835,835,YOUNG DE LA CRUZ,835,"Oh, I could never hate you. If you
must go, then I'm... I'm sending
you off with a toast!"
836,836,YOUNG DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D),836,"To our friendship. I would move
Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.
Salud!"
837,837,HÉCTOR (V.O.),837,You walked me to the train station.
838,838,HÉCTOR (V.O.),838,"But I felt a pain in my stomach. I
thought it must have been something
I ate..."
839,839,YOUNG DE LA CRUZ,839,"Perhaps it was that chorizo my
friend..."
840,840,HÉCTOR (V.O.),840,Or something I... drank.
841,841,HÉCTOR,841,You took everything away from me!
842,842,HÉCTOR,842,You rat!
843,843,DE LA CRUZ,843,"Have him taken care of.      He's not
well."
844,844,HÉCTOR,844,"I just wanted to go back home!      No,
no, NO!"
845,845,DE LA CRUZ,845,I apologize. Where were we?
846,846,MIGUEL,846,"You were going to give me your
blessing..."
847,847,DE LA CRUZ,847,Yes.   Uh... sí.
848,848,DE LA CRUZ,848,"Miguel, my reputation, it is very
important to me. I would hate to
have you think..."
849,849,MIGUEL,849,"That you murdered Héctor... for his
songs?"
850,850,DE LA CRUZ,850,You don't think that.     Do you?
851,851,MIGUEL,851,"I -- no! Everyone knows you're
the... the good guy."
852,852,MIGUEL,852,Papá Ernesto? My blessing?
853,853,DE LA CRUZ,853,Security!
854,854,DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D),854,"Take care of Miguel. He'll be
extending his stay."
855,855,MIGUEL,855,What?!    But I'm your family!
856,856,DE LA CRUZ,856,And Héctor was my best friend.
857,857,DE LA CRUZ,857,"Success doesn't come     for free,
Miguel. You have to      be willing to
do whatever it takes     to... seize
your moment. I know      you
understand."
858,858,MIGUEL,858,"No, NO!"
859,859,MIGUEL,859,Let go!
860,860,MIGUEL,860,NO!   AHHHHHH!
861,861,MIGUEL,861,"Help! Can anyone hear me?        I wanna
go home!"
862,862,MIGUEL,862,Héctor?
863,863,HÉCTOR,863,Kid?
864,864,MIGUEL,864,"Oh, Héctor!"
865,865,MIGUEL,865,"You were right. I should have gone
back to my family--"
866,866,HÉCTOR,866,"Hey -- hey, hey..."
867,867,MIGUEL,867,"They told me not to be like de la
Cruz, but I didn't listen--"
868,868,HÉCTOR,868,"Hey, it's okay..."
869,869,MIGUEL,869,"I told them I didn't care if they
remembered me. I didn't care if I
was on their stupid ofrenda."
870,870,HÉCTOR,870,"Hey, chamaco, it's okay.         It's
okay."
871,871,MIGUEL,871,I told them I didn't care.
872,872,HÉCTOR,872,Hhuuh!
873,873,MIGUEL,873,Héctor!   Héctor--
874,874,HÉCTOR,874,She's... forgetting me.
875,875,MIGUEL,875,Who?
876,876,HÉCTOR,876,My daughter...
877,877,MIGUEL,877,"She's the reason you wanted to
cross the bridge..."
878,878,HÉCTOR,878,I just wanted to see her again...
879,879,HÉCTOR,879,"I never should have left Santa
Cecilia. I wish I could apologize.
I wish I could tell her that her
papá was trying to come home. That
he loved her so much."
880,880,HÉCTOR,880,My Coco...
881,881,MIGUEL,881,Coco?
882,882,MIGUEL (CONT'D),882,"You should be the one the world
remembers, not de la Cruz!"
883,883,HÉCTOR,883,"I didn't write ""Remember Me"" for
the world... I wrote it for Coco.
I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a
great-great grandpa."
884,884,MIGUEL,884,"Are you kidding? A minute ago I
thought I was related to a
murderer. You're a total upgrade!"
885,885,MIGUEL,885,"My whole life, there's been
something that made me different...
and I never knew where it came
from."
886,886,MIGUEL,886,But now I know. It comes from you.
887,887,MIGUEL,887,I'm proud we're family!
888,888,MIGUEL (CONT'D),888,"I'm proud to be his family!
TRRRRRAI-HAY-HAY-HAY-HAAAY!"
889,889,HÉCTOR,889,"TRRRRRRAAAAAI-HAAAI-HAAAAAY!
I'm proud to be HIS family!"
890,890,DANTE (O.S),890,Rooo-rooo-roooooooo!
891,891,MIGUEL,891,Dante?
892,892,DANTE (O.S.),892,Roooooo-roo-roo-rooo!
893,893,MIGUEL,893,Dante!    It's Dante!
894,894,HÉCTOR,894,Imelda!
895,895,MAMÁ IMELDA,895,Héctor.
896,896,HÉCTOR,896,You look good...
897,897,MIGUEL,897,"Dante, you knew he was my Papá
Héctor the whole time! You ARE a
real spirit guide!"
898,898,MIGUEL,898,"Who's a good spirit guide? You
are!"
899,899,MIGUEL,899,Whoa...
900,900,MIGUEL,900,Dante!
901,901,PAPÁ JULIO,901,"Look, there they are!"
902,902,FAMILY,902,"Miguel! / Miguelito! / Ay, gracias
a Dios! / It's Miguel! / He's all
right! / Oh thank goodness! /
Gracias, Dios mío!"
903,903,MAMÁ IMELDA,903,"Mijo, I was so worried! Thank
goodness we found you in time!"
904,904,MAMÁ IMELDA,904,"And you! How many times must I
turn you away?"
905,905,HÉCTOR,905,Imelda--
906,906,MAMÁ IMELDA,906,"I want nothing to do with you. Not
in life, not in death!"
907,907,MAMÁ IMELDA,907,"I spent decades protecting my
family from your mistakes. He
spends five minutes with you and I
have to fish him out of a sinkhole!"
908,908,MIGUEL,908,"I wasn't in there `cause of Héctor.
He was in there `cause of me."
909,909,MIGUEL,909,"He was just trying to get me
home... I didn't wanna listen, but
he was right... nothing is more
important than family."
910,910,MIGUEL (CONT'D),910,"I'm ready to accept your
blessing... and your conditions.
But first, I need to find de la
Cruz. To get Héctor's photo."
911,911,MAMÁ IMELDA,911,What?
912,912,MIGUEL,912,"So he can see Coco again.        Héctor
should be on our ofrenda.        He's
part of our family--"
913,913,MAMÁ IMELDA,913,He left this family!
914,914,MIGUEL,914,"He tried to go home to you and
Coco... but de la Cruz murdered
him!"
915,915,HÉCTOR,915,"It's true, Imelda."
916,916,MAMÁ IMELDA,916,"And so what if it's true? You
leave me alone with a child to
raise and I'm just supposed to
forgive you?"
917,917,HÉCTOR,917,"Imelda, I--"
918,918,MIGUEL,918,Héctor?
919,919,HÉCTOR,919,"I'm running out of time.         It's
Coco..."
920,920,MAMÁ IMELDA,920,She's forgetting you...
921,921,MIGUEL,921,"You don't have to forgive him...
But we shouldn't forget him."
922,922,MAMÁ IMELDA,922,"I wanted to forget you. I wanted
Coco to forget you too, but--"
923,923,HÉCTOR,923,"This is my fault, not yours."
924,924,HÉCTOR,924,"I'm sorry, Imelda."
925,925,MAMÁ IMELDA,925,"Miguel, if we help you get his
photo... you will return home?          No
more music?"
926,926,MIGUEL,926,Family comes first.
927,927,MAMÁ IMELDA,927,"I -- I can't forgive you.        But I
will help you."
928,928,MAMÁ IMELDA,928,So how do we get to de la Cruz?
929,929,MIGUEL,929,I might know a way...
930,930,MIGUEL,930,Everyone clear on the plan?
931,931,TÍA VICTORIA,931,Find Héctor's photo.
932,932,PAPÁ JULIO,932,Give it to Miguel.
933,933,MAMÁ IMELDA,933,Send Miguel home.
934,934,HÉCTOR,934,Got your petals?
935,935,MAMÁ IMELDA,935,"Now, we just have to find de la
Cruz--"
936,936,DE LA CRUZ,936,Yes?
937,937,MAMÁ IMELDA,937,Ah!
938,938,DE LA CRUZ,938,Don't I know you?
939,939,MAMÁ IMELDA,939,"That's for murdering the love of my
life!"
940,940,DE LA CRUZ,940,Who the?
941,941,HÉCTOR,941,She's talking about me!
942,942,HÉCTOR,942,I'm the love of your life?
943,943,MAMÁ IMELDA,943,"I don't know! I'm still angry at
you."
944,944,DE LA CRUZ,944,Héctor?!    How did you--
945,945,MAMÁ IMELDA,945,"And that's for trying to murder my
grandson!"
946,946,DE LA CRUZ,946,Grandson?
947,947,MIGUEL,947,She's talking about me!
948,948,DE LA CRUZ,948,"You! Wait, you're related to
Héctor?"
949,949,MIGUEL,949,The photo!
950,950,MAMÁ IMELDA,950,After him!
951,951,DE LA CRUZ,951,Security!     Ayúdenme!
952,952,HÉCTOR,952,"You said ""love of your life..."""
953,953,MAMÁ IMELDA,953,I don't know WHAT I said!
954,954,MIGUEL,954,That's what I heard...
955,955,STAGEHAND,955,"Places, señor, you're on in 30
seconds!"
956,956,MAMÁ IMELDA,956,Miguel!   I have it!
957,957,MIGUEL,957,"Hurry, come on!"
958,958,ANNOUNCER (O.S.),958,"Ladies and gentlemen... the one,
the only... ERNESTO DE LA CRUZ!"
959,959,CROWD MEMBER,959,Nesto!
960,960,DE LA CRUZ,960,Get her off the stage!
961,961,MIGUEL (O.S.),961,Sing!
962,962,MIGUEL (CONT'D),962,SING!
963,963,MAMÁ IMELDA,963,"AY DE MÍ, LLORONA
LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE..."
964,964,MAMÁ IMELDA,964,"AY DE MÍ, LLORONA
LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE..."
965,965,MAMÁ IMELDA,965,"Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA,
NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE.
NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE!"
966,966,MAMÁ IMELDA,966,"ME SUBÍ AL PINO MÁS ALTO, LLORONA,
A VER SI TE DIVISABA."
967,967,MAMÁ IMELDA,967,"COMO EL PINO ERA TIERNO, LLORONA
AL VERME LLORAR, LLORABA."
968,968,MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D),968,"AY DE MÍ, LLORONA, LLORONA,
LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE..."
969,969,DE LA CRUZ/MAMÁ IMELDA,969,"AY DE MÍ, LLORONA, LLORONA
LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE..."
970,970,DE LA CRUZ/MAMÁ IMELDA,970,"Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA,
NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE."
971,971,DE LA CRUZ,971,"Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA,
NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE.
NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE!"
972,972,MAMÁ IMELDA,972,Let go of me!
973,973,DE LA CRUZ,973,"NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE!
...AY, AY, AY!"
974,974,MAMÁ IMELDA,974,I forgot what that felt like.
975,975,HÉCTOR,975,You... still got it.
976,976,MIGUEL,976,Ahem.
977,977,MAMÁ IMELDA,977,Oh!
978,978,MAMÁ IMELDA,978,"Miguel, I give you my blessing."
979,979,MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D),979,"To go home... to put up our
photos..."
980,980,MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D),980,And to never...
981,981,MIGUEL,981,Never play music again...
982,982,MAMÁ IMELDA,982,"To never... forget how much your
family loves you."
983,983,HÉCTOR,983,You're going home.
984,984,DE LA CRUZ,984,You're not going anywhere!
985,985,HÉCTOR,985,Imelda--
986,986,DE LA CRUZ,986,Stay back!     Stay back.   All of you!
987,987,DE LA CRUZ,987,Stay back!     Not one more step.
988,988,MIGUEL,988,Dante!
989,989,HÉCTOR,989,"Ernesto, stop! Leave the boy
alone!"
990,990,DE LA CRUZ,990,"I've worked too hard, Héctor...
Too hard to let him destroy
everything..."
991,991,HÉCTOR,991,"He's a living child, Ernesto!"
992,992,DE LA CRUZ,992,He's a threat!
993,993,DE LA CRUZ,993,"You think I'd let him go back to
the land of the living with your
photo? To keep your memory alive?"
994,994,DE LA CRUZ,994,No.
995,995,MIGUEL,995,You're a coward!
996,996,DE LA CRUZ,996,"I am Ernesto de la Cruz, the
greatest musician of all time!"
997,997,MIGUEL,997,"Héctor's the real musician, you're
just the guy who murdered him and
stole his songs!"
998,998,CROWD,998,Murder?
999,999,DE LA CRUZ,999,"I am the one who is willing to do
what it takes to seize my moment..."
1000,1000,DE LA CRUZ,1000,Whatever it takes.
1001,1001,MIGUEL,1001,AHHH!
1002,1002,HÉCTOR,1002,NO!
1003,1003,TÍO OSCAR/TÍO FELIPE,1003,Miguel!
1004,1004,MAMÁ IMELDA,1004,Miguel!
1005,1005,DE LA CRUZ,1005,"Apologies old friend, but the show
