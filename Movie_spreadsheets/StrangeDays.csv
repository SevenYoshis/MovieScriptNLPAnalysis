0,VOICE,0,Ready?
1,SECOND VOICE (LENNY),1,Yeah.  Boot it.
2,OUR VOICE,2,Okay.  It's goin'.  I'm recording.
3,LANE,3,"Good one, dickhead.  Thanks for
waitin' till I get this fuckin thing
on.  You tryin' ta I.D. me, or
what?"
4,LANE,4,Next alley... just pull in slow.
5,LANE,5,Hurry up will ya.  Here.
6,LANE,6,Let's go.
7,OUR VOICE,7,"Don't move, don't talk, don't do
nothing."
8,LANE,8,Don't stop!
9,LENNY,9,"This is great... the doors are all
locked.  Who are these losers,
friends of yours?"
10,LENNY (V.O.),10,"Wow... the gas tank is a nice touch.
Oh, oh, end of the line boys."
11,LANE,11,Come on!  Fucking jump man!
12,LENNY,12,"Goddamnit!  You know I don't deal in
snuff.  How many times I hafta tell
you?!"
13,TICK,13,"Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny."
14,LENNY,14,"Well you could've at least warned
me.  You know I hate the zap... when
they die.  It just brings down your
whole day.  Jeez, Tick."
15,TICK,15,Sorry.
16,LENNY,16,"How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't
the cops put it in evidence?"
17,TICK,17,"With all the blood I guess they
didn't see the rig.  Guy had it
under a wig."
18,LENNY,18,"Yeah, but how'd it get to you?"
19,TICK,19,"I got ways, Lenny, I got ways."
20,TICK,20,"Okay, okay... I got a deal with some
a the paramedics.  My guy pages me
and I pick it up at the morgue.  So
whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be
worth at least a grand.  Right?"
21,LENNY,21,"Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I
don't deal this kind of product, you
know that.  I'll give you four for
it, cause I've gotta cut off the
last bit.  And my customers want
uncut."
22,TICK,22,"Fuck that!  The last part's the
best.  You dry-dive six stories and
blammo!  Jack right into the Big
Black."
23,LENNY,23,"I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's
policy.  I got ethics here."
24,TICK,24,"Yeah, when did that start?  Come on,
man!  It's what people want to see,
and you know it."
25,LENNY,25,So lay it off to somebody else.
26,TICK,26,"Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I
got to get this rig fixed.  Look at
it..."
27,TICK,27,"Give me six at least.  This's a good
clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'."
28,LENNY,28,"Yeah, well, the first part's okay.
Better than the usual soaps you
bring me."
29,TICK,29,"Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always
bring you choice."
30,LENNY,30,"Sure, like this low-grade shit here,
some girl in a fight with her
boyfriend... it's a test-pattern.
Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'."
31,TICK,31,"Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me
real life.  Bring me street life.
And, like, one man's mundane and
desperate existence is another man's
Technicolor.'"
32,LENNY,32,"I said that?  Look, I'll take it for
five, and you'll make out okay,
because in this case it's pure
cream, you don't have to cut
anything back to the wearer."
33,TICK,33,Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
34,LENNY,34,What else you got?
35,LENNY,35,"Look, Jerr.  I'm nothing if not a
man of my word.  I'll drop the money
by tomorrow, next day latest.  It's
a little crazed right now.  Yeah, on
my mother's eyes, I swear.  Thanks,
buddy."
36,LENNY,36,Prick.
37,LENNY,37,"What kinda move you call that?!
Lemmings."
38,TALK-RADIO HOST,38,"... it's a little after 2 am on
December 30th, 1999... the second to
last day of the whole darn century,
and the phone lines are open.  Dan
from Silverlake, you're on the air."
39,DAN FROM SILVERLAKE,39,"Uh, hi."
40,HOST,40,"So Dan, are you looking forward to
the New Year?"
41,DAN,41,"Not really.  I mean what's the
point?  Nothing changes New Years
day.  The economy sucks, gas is over
three bucks a gallon, fifth grade
kids are shooting each other at
recess... the whole thing sucks,
right?  So what the hell are we
celebrating?"
42,HOST,42,"You're a glass-is-half-empty kind of
guy, aren't you Dan?  Well I for one
happen to think that us making it
2000 years is worth celebrating--"
43,LENNY,43,"Jimbo.  I'm there, Jimmy.  Right now,
can't you hear me knockin'?"
44,LENNY,44,"-- so you line up the talent, shoot
the clip, get it to me by Monday.
OK?  Client wants a guy and two
girls, the guy wears... yeah, I
know, thinks he's being original.
Girls have to be young.  So don't
use your mother like you usually do.
Yeah, you too, pendejo.  And no big
tits... French tits.  That's it...
like Champagne glasses... you got
it.  What a pro.  Page me."
45,LORI,45,"If you read the Bible, Mark, you'd
know that there won't be another
thousand years.  Right now we are in
the Last Days, as foretold in the
book of--"
46,HOST,46,"The Last Days?  You mean the coming
of the Apocalypse, right?  The
Rapture?"
47,LORI,47,"Yes, that's right.  You only have to
look at the signs... there are wars
and rumors of wars--"
48,LENNY,48,I live here.
49,HOST,49,"Now just so the rest of us know how
much time is left, when is the
Rapture supposed to hit, exactly?
Is it midnight New Year's Eve?"
50,HOST,50,"Is that midnight LA time, or Eastern
Standard or what?  I mean, what time
zone is God in, anyway?"
51,LORI,51,I pray for you all.
52,LENNY,52,"I just got something in, Bobby, you
might appreciate.  A 211 at a Thai
joint goes south, and these three
scuzzballs end up in a gun-and-run.
It's a beauty, two thumbs up.
Parental discretion advised.  I'm
talking it's the master, not some
stepped-on copy.  One of a kind."
53,LENNY,53,"Yo, Skinner.  The Skin Man."
54,LENNY,54,Red leather.  Nice feminine touch.
55,SKINNER,55,"Fuck you, Nero."
56,LENNY,56,Whattya got for me?
57,LENNY,57,"Yeah, I can use this..."
58,LENNY,58,"... but honey you gotta move your
eyes slower next time.  It's too
jerky."
59,SKINNER,59,"It was her first time, Lenny.  Cut
her some slack."
60,HOST,60,"Go ahead, caller, you're on the air."
61,VOICE,61,"My name's DeWayne, and I got a New
Year's resolution for the po-lice.
Hey, yo Five Oh, you better get down
with 2-K."
62,HOST,62,2-K?  What's that DeWayne?
63,DEWAYNE,63,"2-K.  The big two thousand.  Comin
tomorrow night.  Out with the old
and in wit da new.  See for the Man,
no new is good new, what I'm sayin.
He like to keep it the way it is.
But we going to take it, make it
new, make it our own.  History gonna
start right here, right now--"
64,LENNY,64,"Hi, Dave, this is Lenny."
65,LENNY,65,"Nero.  Lenny Nero.  That's right.
Oh, is it late?  Sorry.  It's just
that I have something that might be
of interest, and since I always call
you first--"
66,LENNY,66,"Uh, huh.  Well, what would be a good
time?  Okay, sure.  Catch you then."
67,EDUARDO,67,"Let me get this straight... you
gonna pay me 200 bucks to put on a
hair net and bang some beautiful
babe.  I don't know, I gotta think
about this."
68,LENNY,68,"Okay, let's get you wired up.  I
hope this axle grease you got in
your hair doesn't screw up the squid
receptors."
69,EDUARDO,69,What's all this squid shit?
70,LENNY,70,"Superconducting QUantum Interference
Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's
gonna be a test."
71,EDUARDO,71,"Hey, fuck you, man."
72,LENNY,72,"Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a
sense of humor at all times.  Okay,
the receptor rig... what I'm putting
on your head... sends a signal to
the recorder."
73,LENNY,73,"See we call it ""being wired,"" but
there's no wire.  You gotta keep the
recorder close... five, six feet
away max, like in your jacket pocket
by the bed or wherever you're going
to close escrow, know what I mean?"
74,EDUARDO,74,"Yeah, right."
75,LENNY,75,"Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes
around.  Don't look in the mirror or
you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a
half hour of tape, so give me some
lead-in to the main event.  But
don't wait too long, I don't want to
be going out for popcorn.  And don't
act natural.  Don't act at all.
Just forget the thing is on.  Got
it?"
76,EDUARDO,76,No problem.
77,LENNY,77,A star is born.
78,ENGELMAN,78,"She's a hooker, vice'll have her in
the book.  We can pick her up later."
79,SPREG,79,No.  Now.
80,DISPATCHER (V.O.),80,Do you request back-up?
81,SPREG,81,"Negative.  Suspect is a black male,
age 35 to 40.  We're handling it."
82,ENGELMAN,82,FREEZE!
83,ENGELMAN,83,Oh shit.
84,IRIS (V.O.),84,"Lenny, goddamn it, you got to be
there, you got to help me, come on,
pick up, pick up..."
85,IRIS,85,"... you got to be there for me...
COME ON!  Shit, I'll call later."
86,FAITH,86,"Hey, you going to watch or you going
to do?"
87,LENNY,87,Watch and see.
88,FAITH,88,"I love your eyes, Lenny."
89,FAITH,89,I love the way they see.
90,ANCHORWOMAN,90,"... bodies of two men found early
this morning under the Hollywood
freeway have been identified as rap
star Jeriko One and bandmember James
Polton, known to fans as ""Replay"".
A third body, that of a woman, has
not yet been identified.  With his
band, the Prophets of Rage, Jeriko
One's outspoken political stance
and violent lyrics have stirred
nationwide controversy..."
91,LENNY,91,"You know I can get you anything you
want, anytime you want it, just not
right now.  We'll hook up at the
club later.  Around eleven.  Yeah."
92,BARTENDER,92,"Hey, Lenny."
93,LENNY,93,Anything without an umbrella.
94,FABRIZIO,94,"Lenny my man, I think you want to
meet a friend of mine."
95,LENNY,95,Looks like money to me.
96,FABRIZIO,96,Don't forget your friends.
97,LENNY,97,"10 percent, Fabri, like always."
98,FABRI,98,"Keith, this is Lenny.  Guy I was
telling you about.  He can get you
anything you--"
99,LENNY,99,"Just a second.  Not to be rude,
Keith, but I got to ask, are you a
cop?"
100,KEITH,100,"I understand.  No, I'm not."
101,LENNY,101,"You understand?  Attorney!  Right?
Am I right?"
102,KEITH,102,That's right.
103,LENNY,103,"Tassel shoes.  Entertainment law,
would be my guess."
104,LENNY,104,"Relax.  I just like to guess, is
all.  It's my job to know people and
what they want... what's behind
their eyes."
105,FABRIZIO,105,"Lenny gives people their heart's
desire.  Ain't that right, Lenny?"
106,LENNY,106,"That's right.  My second question I
gotta ask, so we get our bearings
here... have you ever jacket in?
Have you ever wiretripped?"
107,KEITH,107,No.
108,LENNY,108,"A virgin brain!  Well we're going to
start you off right.  So what do you
know about this?  Save us some
time..."
109,KEITH,109,"Just what I've read.  That the
technology was developed for the
Feds, to replace the body wire.  And
now it's gone black market.  So, uh,
do I get the deck from you?"
110,LENNY,110,"I'll set you up, get you a deck at
my cost... since my thing is the
software."
111,KEITH,111,Clips.
112,LENNY,112,That's right.  Clips.
113,LENNY,113,"Look, I want you to know what we're
talking about here.  This isn't like
TV only better.  This is life.  It's
a piece of somebody's life.  Pure
and uncut, straight from the
cerebral cortex.  You're there.
You're doing it, seeing it, hearing
it... feeling it."
114,KEITH,114,What kind of things exactly?
115,LENNY,115,"Exactly anything.  Whatever you
want.  Whoever you want to be."
116,LENNY,116,"Fabri, get us another round, would
you."
117,LENNY,117,"You want to go skiing without
leaving your den, you can.  But I'm
assuming a guy like you, you wanna
go skiing you fly to Aspen.  That's
not what you're interested in here.
It's about the stuff you can't
have... right?  The forbidden
fruit."
118,LENNY,118,"Like running into a liquor store
with a .357 magnum in your hand,
feeling the adrenalin pumping
through your veins.  Or..."
119,LENNY,119,"... see that guy, with the drop-dead
Philipino girl friend?"
120,LENNY,120,"Wouldn't you like to be that guy for
twenty minutes?  The right twenty
minutes.  I can make it happen.  And
you won't even tarnish your wedding
ring."
121,KEITH,121,Sounds good.
122,LENNY,122,"I can get you what you want.  You
just have to talk to me.  I'm your
priest, your shrink, your main
connection to the switchboard of
souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa
Claus of the Subconscious.  You say
it, you even think it, you can have
it.  You want a girl, you want two
girls?  I don't know what your thing
is or what you're curious about...
you want a guy?  You want to be a
girl... see what that feels like?
You want a nun to tie you up?  It's
all doable."
123,KEITH,123,"Talk to me about costs, here."
124,LENNY,124,"Listen, before we get into numbers,
I want you to try a taste.  I got a
deck with me."
125,KEITH,125,What?  Right Here?
126,LENNY,126,Step into my office.
127,LENNY,127,"You were just an eighteen year old
girl taking a shower.  Are you
beginning to see the possibilities
here?"
128,MAN (MAX),128,Where is he?
129,KEITH,129,"Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get
someplace a little less public?"
130,LENNY,130,"You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops
have more to worry about in this
city than the squid-trade, believe
me--"
131,MAN (MAX),131,"Don't move!  That's it, assume the
position you miserable techno-perv
puke."
132,MAN,132,Beat it fuckwad.
133,MAN (MAX),133,Gotcha.
134,LENNY,134,"Damnit, Max, I was with a client!
You think that's funny?  To mess
with a man's livelihood?  It's not
funny!"
135,MAX,135,"You see the look on that preppy
puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his
Topsiders."
136,LENNY,136,"Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me
money."
137,MAX,137,"Come on, amigo, the world's full of
marks.  And nobody knows how to work
'em like you do, pal.  You could
sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a
wedding ring!  Let me buy you a
drink."
138,LENNY,138,Least you can do.
139,REGULAR,139,"Yo, Pelcher!  Mad Max!"
140,MAX,140,"Fuckin' A right I'm mad!  I might
kill every man in here.  But first
I'm buyin' my buddy here a drink."
141,MAX,141,"Hey O'Neal!  You were right, your
wife does give good head."
142,MAX,142,"Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor!
Double shots.  Make it Tres
Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the
best for my good friend Lenny, the
finest cop that ever got thrown off
the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie."
143,LENNY,143,"Thanks, Max."
144,MAX,144,"D'you always have to dress like a
fuckin' pimp?"
145,LENNY,145,"This tie cost more than your entire
wardrobe."
146,MAX,146,That's not sayin' much.
147,LENNY,147,"It's the one thing that stands
between me and the jungle."
148,MAX,148,"To the jungle!  Where outa the blue
some shitbird can cap you in the
back of the head and ruin your whole
day."
149,LENNY,149,"You were lucky, Max."
150,MAX,150,"Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with
a .22-short floating in my brainpan,
and a cop pension I can't live off
of.  Good thing I wasn't any
luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter
right here!"
151,MAX,151,You seen Faith lately?
152,LENNY,152,Naw.  She won't call me.
153,MAX,153,"Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get
past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by
far the most outstanding woman a guy
like you could ever hope to get, I
mean it's completely and deeply
humiliating that she's gone, but
it's over, campadre."
154,LENNY,154,"Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your
concern."
155,MAX,155,"I just hate to see you pining away.
It makes me want to vomit, frankly."
156,MAX,156,Broken hearts are for assholes.
157,LENNY,157,"Hey, Iris, you okay?"
158,IRIS,158,"Lenny, I got to talk to you, it's
serious..."
159,MAX,159,"What happened, honey, some john get
rough on you?"
160,IRIS,160,"I mean talk private.  Please, I'm in
trouble, and so is Faith."
161,MAX,161,"There it is, the magic fuckin' word."
162,IRIS,162,"Can we go to your car?  There's
something you have to see right
away."
163,LENNY,163,What's going on?
164,IRIS,164,"It's a bad situation... if they get
me I know they're going to -- OH
SHIT!"
165,LENNY,165,"Hang on, that's my car--"
166,TOW DRIVER,166,Not anymore.  Belongs to the bank.
167,LENNY,167,Hey wait a second...
168,LENNY,168,"Oh, yeah, that's the answer!  Two
million years of human evolution and
that's the best idea you can come up
with?"
169,LENNY,169,"Okay.  Look, whattya get to repo a
car?  Two hundred?  Two fifty?  I'll
pay you three fifty, right now.  All
you gotta do is drop it off the hook
and say you came by, your mark
wasn't here.  Simple.  Make a few
bucks.  Do a good deed.  Huh?"
170,DRIVER,170,You got the cash on you?
171,LENNY,171,"I was going to write you a check, if
that's--"
172,LENNY,172,"Okay, okay, I totally respect that
call.  I would want cash.  They'll
take my check inside... I can see
you're pressed for time, just give
me two minutes... here keep my watch
for collateral."
173,LENNY,173,"It's a Rolex.  Be right back.  Two
minutes."
174,LENNY,174,Son of a bitch!
175,MACE,175,"Hello?  Hey Lenny, whatup?"
176,MACE,176,"Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Sure.  So what
happened to your car this time?"
177,MAX,177,"See, if you packed your piece you
could've made the guy see sense."
178,LENNY,178,"Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the
line of a fine jacket."
179,MAX,179,"An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's
embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen
with you."
180,MAX,180,"Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?"
181,MACE,181,"Greetings, gents."
182,MACE,182,So let's hear this week's sad story.
183,LENNY,183,"They jerked my wheels, d'you believe
it?  I mean it's outrageous, the
computer errors the banks are making
lately.  Have you noticed?"
184,MACE,184,"No.  I haven't noticed because I
make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher,
how's the P.I. business?"
185,MAX,185,Sucks.
186,MAX,186,"Hey, Bobby, turn that up."
187,JERIKO ONE (ON T.V.),187,"The LAPD is a military force turned
against its own people.  We live in
a police state!  The mayor and the
city council sit up in their offices
with their social programs that
don't work... they're rearranging
deck chairs on the Titanic.  But the
new day is coming!  Two-K is coming!
The day of reckoning is upon us.
History ends and begins again right
here!  Right now!"
188,MAX,188,To the end of all things!
189,MAX,189,"You know how I know it's the end of
the world?  Because everything's
been done, every kind of music's
been tried, every government's been
tried, every fuckin' hairstyle.
How you gonna make it another
thousand years, for Chrissake?"
190,MAX,190,"I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used
it all up--"
191,LENNY,191,Shutup a second!
192,MACE,192,"Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?"
193,MAX,193,Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.
194,MAX,194,"Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden
goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer
guy."
195,MACE,195,But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
196,MAX,196,"Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You
may trigger a maudlin display which
will force us to tranquilize him."
197,REPORTER,197,"The LAPD have said they believe
this is a gang-related incident.
Can you comment on that, Mr. Vo?"
198,TRAN,198,"We have no facts yet.  All we know
for sure is that we have lost a
great artist, that a great voice for
change is now silent..."
199,LENNY,199,"Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just
have a few stops, mostly on the west
side--"
200,MACE,200,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd
drop you home, but I'm not taking
you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've
already pulled twelve hours today."
201,LENNY,201,"Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a
big night.  Can't you feel it?  The
energy in the air?  There's money to
be made, dreams to sell."
202,MACE,202,Sleaze to peddle.
203,LENNY,203,"Just a couple of hours.  It'll be
fun--"
204,MACE,204,"Excuse me.  What part of NO don't
you understand?"
205,LENNY,205,"Mace, you're my friend.  I need you.
Plus I'll give you 25% of what I
make tonight."
206,MACE,206,"Lenny, this may be a hard concept
for you, but friends don't have to
pay their friends."
207,MACE,207,"Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got
a pickup at the St. James.  I'll
take you there, you can get a cab."
208,LENNY,208,Mace!  You're a life-saver.
209,MACE,209,Driving Mr. Lenny.
210,MACE,210,"So, what's up with you?  Another
busy night selling porno to
wireheads?"
211,LENNY,211,"No, wrong... I sell experiences.
Sex is only part of it."
212,MACE,212,Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
213,LENNY,213,"Way I look at it, I actually perform
a humanitarian service.  I save
lives."
214,MACE,214,"Uh huh, I wanna hear this part."
215,LENNY,215,"Okay, take some executive... bored
with his life, bored with his
wife... he picks up a hooker or some
girl at a bar.  Then he goes around
for months, torn up worrying that
he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his
wife.  And maybe he really does
catch something--"
216,MACE,216,"Price he pays for being a
scumsucking pig."
217,LENNY,217,"Everybody needs to take a walk to
the dark end of the street sometime,
it's what we are.  But now the risks
are outa line.  The streets are a
war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So
you slip on the trodes, you get what
you need and it keeps you from
jumping your tracks."
218,MACE,218,"Lenny, this shit's illegal."
219,LENNY,219,Define illegal.
220,MACE,220,"Me bailing your sorry pale ass out
of jail twice in the last six
months."
221,LENNY,221,"Yeah, but that was for love."
222,MACE,222,Define love.
223,MACE,223,"Dammit, Lenny, you made me late."
224,LENNY,224,What's his name?
225,MACE,225,Fumitsu.
226,LENNY,226,"Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir,
Leonard Nero, Security Express.
Lornette Mason here is just
completing our routine driver
evaluation.  We do it to make sure
that out VIP clients, such as
yourself, are always treated as
honored guests.  I just need to ride
up front and take some notes, if you
don't mind."
227,MACE,227,"Um, excuse me."
228,MACE,228,Sir.  Excuse me.  Mr. Nero.
229,MACE,229,What the fuck are you doing?
230,LENNY,230,Coming with you.
231,MACE,231,"You will not live to see the
morning."
232,STRICKLAND,232,Nero.
233,LENNY,233,Strickland.
234,STRICKLAND,234,Commissioner Strickland.
235,LENNY,235,"Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you
shitcanned my career, I don't even
have to call you sir.  One of life's
small pleasures."
236,STRICKLAND,236,"Aren't you peddling your wares a
little far from your usual gutter?"
237,LENNY,237,"I was invited here by a close
friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right
over there."
238,STRICKLAND,238,"I don't like disappointments, Nero.
And do you know what disappoints me
very much?"
239,LENNY,239,Your sex life?
240,STRICKLAND,240,Your existence.
241,MACE,241,"Now listen to me... you have to get
to bed young man.  I mean it.  No
watching ""Tales from the Crypt"".  I
don't care what Cecile says.  I'll
see you in the morning, baby.
Night, night."
242,MACE,242,Are we having a bad night?
243,LENNY,243,Let's talk in the car.
244,FAITH,244,"I feel like you're turning me into a
VCR."
245,LENNY,245,"I just want to see what we're like
together through your eyes."
246,FAITH,246,I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
247,LENNY,247,Forget it's there.
248,FAITH,248,"Make me forget it, baby."
249,LENNY,249,"Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is
Armani."
250,LENNY,250,You angry?
251,MACE,251,I've had enough of this shit.
252,MACE,252,"You're on foot, Lenny."
253,LENNY,253,In LA?  Are you crazy?
254,LENNY,254,"Can I come in please?  I'm having a
hard time hearing the stereo."
255,LENNY,255,"I need my case.  It's still in the
back."
256,MACE,256,Get it.
257,LENNY,257,"Listen, can we talk a little bit
here, like two rational adults?"
258,LENNY,258,That would be no.
259,MACE,259,"I've had it.  No more wirehead shit
in my car.  You understand?  You
want to poach your lobes, do it
somewhere else."
260,LENNY,260,"Okay, you got my attention, but this
is cutting off the circulation to my
head, here.  D'you mind?"
261,LENNY,261,I thought we were friends.
262,MACE,262,"No, see a friend is more than one
person constantly doing favors for
another.  You just suck people along
with your schemes and your scams and
your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I
got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex-
husband someplace who doesn't send
me a dime of support... I'm just
trying to hold on here."
263,LENNY,263,So am I.  Just trying to get by.
264,MACE,264,"No, you're just trying to get off."
265,LENNY,265,"Macey... I've never seen you like
this."
266,MACE,266,"Lenny, you're turning into some
kinda squid-head low-life.  You're
always broke, you just go from one
score to the next.  And you're
getting strung out... you don't even
see it.  Getting high on your own
supply like some crack dealer."
267,LENNY,267,"I know you wouldn't be saying all
this if you didn't care about me.
Thanks, Mace.  Really."
268,MACE,268,"Look, I gotta get some sleep."
269,LENNY,269,"You still like me, don't you?  We're
still buddies?"
270,MACE,270,Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
271,LENNY,271,"Macey, I know you're tired, but can
you drop me at the Retinal Fetish?
It's on your way."
272,MACE,272,"Jesus, Lenny."
273,LENNY,273,"Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic
behavior at all?  Will that help?
Faith's there tonight, and I've got
to talk to her."
274,MACE,274,"Sure, Lenny."
275,MACE,275,"The only thing worse than a junkie
is someone in love."
276,LENNY,276,"Come on, let me buy you a drink.
Let's drink and make up."
277,LENNY,277,"Alright, I'm going to see Faith.
That means you can watch me suffer.
I'll be in agony, you'll feel so
much better.  Total and thorough
payback, whatdya say?"
278,LENNY,278,"Who's the new side of beef in Tran's
posse?"
279,MACE,279,"Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a
running back for the Rams in '96 and
'97."
280,LENNY,280,"Rams... that's football, right?"
281,MACE,281,Forget her.
282,LENNY,282,She still loves me.
283,MACE,283,"She thinks you're a bucket of dog
vomit.  Trust me on this."
284,LENNY,284,She's my destiny.
285,MACE,285,"Destiny?  You living in a perfume
commercial?  She's a hard-climber
that dropped you like a used tampon
when she got a better ride."
286,LENNY,286,You'll see.
287,TRAN,287,"You come to peddle me some tapes,
Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a
couple bucks for the holidays?"
288,LENNY,288,"You're not a client anymore, Tran.
I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a
dead dog's balls."
289,TRAN,289,"I already got everything I need from
you."
290,FAITH,290,"Cut it out, Tran."
291,LENNY,291,"Too bad about your guy Jeriko.
Tough break."
292,TRAN,292,"Show a little respect, Nero.  The
man was an important artist."
293,LENNY,293,"Yeah, important for your label.
Which no doubt is why you're in
mourning.  Don't worry, his
records'll sell out now he's dead.
You'll make out."
294,TRAN,294,I always do.
295,LENNY,295,"Faith, can I talk to you a second?"
296,FAITH,296,"I don't think that's a good idea,
Lenny."
297,LENNY,297,"I just got to talk to you for one
second."
298,TRAN,298,About what?
299,LENNY,299,"That would be between me and Faith,
wouldn't it?"
300,TRAN,300,"I don't feel anything between you.
See, your trouble is you assume too
much, Lenny.  You assume there's
something where there's nothing.
You assume you have a life.  But
you're only hustling pieces of other
lives on tape, and broken parts of
your own."
301,FAITH,301,"We have nothing to talk about,
Lenny."
302,TRAN,302,"Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely
to his car."
303,LENNY,303,"Faith, call me, okay?"
304,FAITH,304,"No, Lenny."
305,LENNY,305,"Tick, listen, I can't stop right
now.  but I'll call you tomorrow
about that thing we were talking
about."
306,TRAN,306,"Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of
stolen dreams."
307,FAITH,307,"Leave him alone, Tran."
308,TRAN,308,"He's no concern of mine, as long as
you don't talk to him.  Don't talk
to anybody.  You understand?  Not
with everything that's going on
right now."
309,FAITH,309,You're too goddamned paranoid.
310,TRAN,310,"Paranoia's only reality on a finer
scale."
311,LENNY,311,"So, those rascals still haven't
grown back yet, huh?"
312,TEX,312,"Nope.  Guess not.  Any day now,
though."
313,LENNY,313,"Present.  Something I had made.  Let
me know what you think."
314,TEX,314,"Hey, alright.  Got something here
for you, too."
315,TEX,315,"It just showed up tonight, don't
know who left it."
316,LENNY,316,Fan mail from some flounder?
317,LENNY,317,"Hi, baby.  I've missed you."
318,FAITH,318,"I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you
talking to me he'll hurt you."
319,LENNY,319,I'm already hurting.
320,FAITH,320,You have to go.  I mean it.
321,LENNY,321,"Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just
answer one question.  Is anything
wrong?  Iris said you might be in
trouble."
322,FAITH,322,You talked to Iris?  When?
323,LENNY,323,Tonight.
324,FAITH,324,"Well I haven't seen her in months.
Who knows what's going on in her
head.  You're really running out of
excuses to come around, aren't you?"
325,LENNY,325,"I know you Faith.  You're afraid of
something.  What's going on?"
326,FAITH,326,"Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take
care of itself."
327,LENNY,327,"It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is
poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's
got you walled in on all sides.  And
he uses the wire too much, he gets
off on tape, not on you."
328,FAITH,328,"That's a good one, coming from you."
329,LENNY,329,"Why don't you just split?  You don't
love him, anybody can see that.  And
to him you're just some kinda
possession, like a Ferrari,
something to show the other guys."
330,FAITH,330,He has his uses too.
331,LENNY,331,"What?  He gonna record you on his
label?"
332,FAITH,332,Maybe.
333,LENNY,333,"Come on, Faith!  He's just toying
with you.  And when he gets bored,
you'll be yesterday's papers."
334,LENNY,334,"Look, baby, I've watched you create
yourself out of nothing.  You're
like a goddamn cruise missile,
targeted on making it.  And you
will."
335,FAITH,335,Damn right.
336,LENNY,336,"It's you up on that stage, not him.
You don't need him."
337,FAITH,337,"You have to get out of here.  If
Tran catches you he'll... he's
acting crazy.  He's doing way too
much playback and he's getting
completely paranoid.  He's such a
control freak, he's even paying Max
to follow me around."
338,LENNY,338,Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
339,FAITH,339,"Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny,
just stay away from Tran, okay?  And
stay away from me.  Stop trying to
rescue me.  Those days are over.
I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to
save me, okay, because I don't need
saving... Just... give up on me."
340,LENNY,340,Can't do it.
341,FAITH,341,"You know one of the ways movies
still have Squid beat?  Because they
always say ""The End."" You always
know when it's over.  It's over!
Now please leave.  I have to go on
again in a couple of minutes."
342,FAITH,342,Hell.
343,LENNY,343,"Shoulda told me about your new gig,
buddy."
344,MAX,344,"I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just
a job.  I feel like shit about it."
345,LENNY,345,You should feel like shit.
346,MAX,346,"I figured, what the hell, I could
take the prick's money and make sure
Faith was OK at the same time.  Do
us both good.  Right?"
347,LENNY,347,"Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for
you."
348,LENNY,348,"Hey, at least you got a job!"
349,LENNY,349,Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
350,MAX,350,I'm on her.
351,LENNY,351,Can I get that?
352,MACE,352,"Hey Lenny, where the hell are you, I
think Tran's got Beemer looking for
you."
353,LENNY,353,Thanks for the tip.
354,LENNY,354,"I recognize you.  You're Wade
Beemer.  Running back for the Rams,
am I right?"
355,BEEMER,355,"Yeah, that's right."
356,LENNY,356,"I saw you play, man.  You were good.
Like a fucking freight train I
remember saying.  So what happened,
injuries or what?"
357,BEEMER,357,Bullshit politics.
358,LENNY,358,"It's always politics.  Like this
thing we're in here, he's paying you
to tune me up, right?  But I could
pay you more not to.  See what I
mean?  I could write you a check
right now--"
359,BEEMER,359,"Come on, let's go, I got to get
back."
360,LENNY,360,"Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's
everything I have on me, what do you
say?  How about a Rolex?"
361,BEEMER,361,"I already got a real one.  Come on,
it won't be too bad.  It's not
personal."
362,LENNY,362,Just not the eyes.
363,LENNY,363,"They oughta get some lights back
there.  A person could get killed
slipping on those stairs.  Let's go."
364,MACE,364,"You're some piece of work, you know
that.  Just calmly backstroking
around in the big toilet bowl, and
somehow you never let it touch you.
I mean, between Vice and this so-
called occupation you're in now, you
must've seen it all."
365,LENNY,365,"I have crawled through the gutter...
through every wrinkle in the human
brain."
366,MACE,366,"What I'm saying.  But you still come
out this goofball romantic."
367,LENNY,367,"It is my sword and my shield, Macey."
368,MACE,368,What's that?  Present from Faith?
369,LENNY,369,No idea.
370,LENNY,370,It's a test pattern so far.
371,LENNY,371,"Alright, a little B&E action."
372,LENNY,372,"Hey, getting good.  Solid suspense
build."
373,MACE,373,What is it?
374,LENNY,374,"Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT
NOW!  Just go!  GO!"
375,IRIS,375,"I haven't seen your face... I
haven't heard your voice... you can
still let me go..."
376,LENNY,376,"Holy shit.  He's jacking her in to
his own output.  She's seeing what
he's seeing.  She's seeing herself."
377,LENNY,377,On my God.  Oh my God.
378,MACE,378,"My God, Lenny.  What is it?"
379,LENNY,379,Black.  Jack.
380,MACE,380,Blackjack?  I don't understand--
381,LENNY,381,"Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said
she needed my help and I... aw
Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker
killed her."
382,MACE,382,Are you sure it's real?
383,MAX,383,Ohhhh shit.
384,MAX,384,Well... I've lost my appetite.
385,MAX,385,For about a year.
386,MACE,386,No way.
387,MAX,387,You alright?  Y'okay?
388,LENNY,388,"Yeah.  No, not really."
389,MAX,389,Let's work it.
390,LENNY,390,"Not now... I don't want to think
about it--"
391,MAX,391,"Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good
at this stuff.  Play it down.
What's the perp doing?"
392,LENNY,392,"He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then
he does her..."
393,MAX,393,"And he records it.  Thrill kill.
Wants to see it again.  And again."
394,LENNY,394,"He records himself raping and
killing her--"
395,MAX,395,"But at the same time he's sending
the signal to her--"
396,LENNY,396,"So she feels... what he feels...
while he's in her.  The thrill while
he's killing her... is sent to her,
heightening her fear... which in
turn heightens the turn on for him."
397,LENNY,397,"I've seen a lot, Max."
398,MAX,398,So've I.  Too much.
399,LENNY,399,But this is a bad one.
400,MAX,400,Top ten.
401,LENNY,401,"He makes her see her own death,
feeds off the reaction... killer and
victim merging... orgasm and agony
merging.  And he records it all."
402,MACE,402,And gives it to you.
403,LENNY,403,Wants to share.
404,MAX,404,"That's right.  He wants to share.
Needs an audience.  This is one sick
puppy."
405,LENNY,405,Why me?
406,MACE,406,"Cause you're the man, right?  The
Magic Man.  If it's got something to
do with the wire, sooner or later it
washes up on your beach."
407,LENNY,407,"I've never dealt in black-jacks.
Never.  Everybody knows that."
408,MAX,408,"He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying
to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing
you to do something."
409,MACE,409,"Maybe he just figures Lenny will
appreciate what he's created.  It's
the dark end of the street, Lenny.
How do you like it now?"
410,LENNY,410,"Jesus, Mace.  Back off."
411,MACE,411,"This guy is someone you know, one of
your squid-head contacts."
412,MAX,412,"Problem is, Lenny knows everybody."
413,MACE,413,Take the tape to the cops.
414,LENNY,414,Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
415,MACE,415,"So some psycho wire-freak gets to
keep running around--"
416,MAX,416,"Naw, he's right.  They'll figure
Lenny's the perp, or go through his
client list, ruin his life... such
as it is.  Look, I'll call the guys
in Homicide... tell them she was a
friend of mine and they'll keep me
in the loop.  Get me the forensics
and all that."
417,MAX,417,"Get some sleep.  I'll call you when
I get something."
418,MAX,418,"And Lenny... I'd keep moving if I
were you."
419,FAITH,419,"You're crazier than I thought,
Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just
in there."
420,LENNY,420,Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
421,FAITH,421,Who did it?
422,LENNY,422,"Don't know.  But this guy's real
damaged goods.  Iris knew someone
was after her... and she said you
were in danger too."
423,LENNY,423,"Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever
you're hiding, whatever's going on,
you have to get out of here now.
Come with me right now.  Don't even
think about it."
424,FAITH,424,"Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You
going to protect me?  Big tough guy.
You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't
even have a gun."
425,LENNY,425,I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
426,FAITH,426,"You don't know what you're fucking
with here."
427,LENNY,427,Tell me.
428,TRAN,428,"Go ahead, Faith.  Tell him."
429,FAITH,429,"Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to
give me some bad news.  An old
friend of mine has been murdered.
You remember Iris?"
430,TRAN,430,"A tragic story, no doubt."
431,TRAN,431,How'd you get up here?
432,LENNY,432,Charm.
433,TRAN,433,"Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you
an offer."
434,TRAN,434,"Take her.  Right now.  If she wants
to go, if she's unhappy here, she
can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith
always knows what she wants."
435,TRAN,435,Hands off.  See?
436,LENNY,436,It's alright.  He means it.
437,TRAN,437,I do mean it.
438,TRAN,438,"And I mean this... if Faith stays
you go away and never come back.
You scuttle back into your cockroach
hole and never cross my vision
again.  You understand?"
439,FAITH,439,"I made my choice, Lenny."
440,TRAN,440,You're going down.
441,FAITH,441,"I don't love you, Lenny.  Give up."
442,FAITH,442,"You said you were going to get her
out of this."
443,TRAN,443,"Maybe now you appreciate the danger
we're in."
444,TRAN,444,"It was touching the way you stood by
me in there.  ""Stand by your man"".
I was moved.  You were very good.  I
don't think he even understands that
you did it for him."
445,FAITH,445,"He doesn't know what's going on.
Leave him alone."
446,TRAN,446,"I'd love to.  But he keeps showing
up.  And you keep talking to him.  I
can't have that--"
447,TRAN,447,"The only time a whore should open
her mouth is when she's giving head."
448,FAITH,448,Fuck you.
449,TRAN,449,Maybe later.
450,LENNY,450,"Listen, can we be smart here?  I
could make it really worth your
while... I could cut you a check for
500 each... hell, make it an even
grand... I'm not saying you don't
land a couple shots, just go light
is all I'm saying... here, take my
Rolex."
451,CORTO,451,Lemme see.
452,CORTO,452,"We tried to find a smaller girl, to
beat the shit out of you, Lenny...
but it was short notice."
453,MACE,453,Safety's on.
454,MACE,454,Lenny!
455,LENNY,455,Is this great fabric or what?
456,MACE,456,"You ever wonder why you get beat up
a lot?"
457,LENNY,457,Never really thought about it.
458,LENNY (V.O.),458,"Come on... look in the mirror.  You
know it's there, you're keeping your
eyes off it, you bastard... SHIT!
Who are you?"
459,LENNY,459,"He knows what he's doing.  He's worn
before... a lot."
460,MACE,460,So that gives you something.
461,LENNY,461,"It gives me... I don't know... maybe
two hundred people who I know wear."
462,MACE,462,"Don't crank the gain any more.
You're gonna fry yourself."
463,LENNY,463,"I need to see more... get more
detail.  Something.  I feel his
presence, so strong..."
464,MACE,464,"No more, Lenny."
465,LENNY,465,Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
466,LENNY,466,"She came to me for help.  I should
have read it better... I just
figured, y'know... another strung-
out hooker having a bad night."
467,MACE,467,It's not your fault.
468,LENNY,468,"Sex killers act alone.  So there's
no information on the street, which
is how cases get made.  Cops know
they'll never nail this guy the
second they look at the scene."
469,LENNY,469,"And anyway, nobody gives a shit
about a dead hooker.  They're
roadkill."
470,LENNY,470,"See, it's all about what they see
walking in.  A dead hooker,
handcuffs, penetration... they'll
see a trick gone wrong.  Random
kill.  The kind you never solve."
471,MACE,471,"But that doesn't add, does it."
472,LENNY,472,No it doesn't.
473,MACE,473,"Because Iris knew somebody was after
her."
474,LENNY,474,"She said ""If they get me"".  They.
Which means the whole sex-killer
thing is a cover, which means
somebody whacked her for a reason."
475,MACE,475,So the guy's not a sicko.
476,LENNY,476,"If he could do what's on that tape,
he's a sicko."
477,MACE,477,"Okay, so he's a freak who thinks
he's sane pretending to be a freak.
The point is, he was a hitter.
Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But
why not just put a little lead in
her ear?"
478,LENNY,478,"Because it had to look random.  Not
connected to anything or anyone."
479,LENNY,479,But then why give the rape to me?
480,MACE,480,"That's where it gets a little
strange."
481,LENNY,481,"And what about the guy that was
following me?"
482,MACE,482,Now you're really getting paranoid.
483,LENNY,483,"The question is not whether I am
paranoid, but whether I am paranoid
enough.  You want to rub my neck?"
484,MACE,484,Sure.
485,LENNY,485,How's Zander?
486,MACE,486,"OK.  He asks about you all the time.
It's been weeks since you've seen
him."
487,MACE,487,"I'm sorry about getting on your case
earlier.  I just see you getting
sucked in deeper and deeper, and I
-- anyway.  I'm sorry."
488,LENNY,488,S'okay.  I know you still love me.
489,ZANDER,489,"Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a
guy?"
490,MACE,490,Just Lenny.
491,ZANDER,491,Right.  That explains it.
492,MACE,492,Are you going to make me beg?
493,MACE,493,What is that?
494,ZANDER,494,"Cheerios and wieners.  I made it
myself.  It's good."
495,MACE,495,"Well give me some then... I'm
starving."
496,MAX (V.O.),496,"Hey, the last day of the world and
you spend it in bed."
497,LENNY,497,"W'sup, Max?"
498,MAX,498,"Not a whole hell of a lot.  They've
just been saying words over Jeriko.
Tensions running pretty high down
here.  I'm telling you."
499,LENNY (V.O.),499,Faith OK?
500,MAX,500,"Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I
got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris
checked into the Sheraton last night
under a false name.  Paid cash."
501,LENNY,501,Looks like she was holding out.
502,MAX,502,"Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in
on Tran last night.  Another slick
Lenny move."
503,LENNY (V.O.),503,"He's in this somehow... I don't know
how.  Just stay close to Faith."
504,MAX,504,"I'm on her, amigo.  No worries.
Gotta jam."
505,MACE,505,Whatup Lenny?
506,LENNY,506,"Jesus, Mace!"
507,MACE,507,Where we going?
508,LENNY,508,Anywhere.
509,LENNY,509,We'll talk about it in the car.
510,LENNY,510,"Hand me that box of tapes, will you?"
511,MACE,511,What is it?
512,LENNY,512,This tie doesn't go with blue!
513,POOR MAN,513,"... the New Years Eve mega-bash of
the century.  Ten square blocks of
madness, with live music, fireworks
and the actual rich and famous of LA
hobnobbing with us peons.  Also
yours truly the Poor Man will be
there at the KROQ bandshell, giving
away ""Millennium LA"" and ""KROQ 2-K""
T-shirts by the truckload--"
514,MACE,514,"Will you relax.  There's nobody back
there."
515,LENNY,515,"Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my
throat.  In my living room.
Relaxing might be right out, okay?!"
516,MACE,516,"You better keep a low profile for a
while."
517,LENNY,517,No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
518,ZANDER,518,What do you got?
519,LENNY,519,Today I have...
520,MACE,520,"Lenny, have you lost it completely?"
521,LENNY,521,"Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is
audio only."
522,LENNY,522,"John Coltrane.  ""A Love Supreme.""
Give it a listen, let me know what
you think, maybe you won't go for it
now, but it'll get in your head and
grow like a seed into something
really beautiful."
523,ZANDER,523,Let's play it now!
524,LENNY,524,"Later.  Your mom'n I are heading
right back out."
525,CECILE,525,"Hey, come on, I been baby-sitting a
full 24 hours, I have to get ready
for the party tonight..."
526,MACE,526,Cecile.
527,MACE,527,"You're not the only little boy I
have to look out for, honey."
528,TICK,528,"Whoa.  That is one unbelievable
piece of eyefuck."
529,LENNY,529,"Skip the art criticism, Tick, what
can you tell me about the wearer."
530,TICK,530,Well... the guy's fucked up.
531,MACE,531,"We know that, Tick."
532,TICK,532,"No, I mean the killer's got some
kind of distortion in his visual
cortex.  The color and gray-scale
values are all messed up, like color
blindness."
533,TICK,533,"Lookit, you see the peak period
ratios there?  Could be some kind of
tumor or brain lesion or something.
Some kind of trauma"
534,TICK,534,"This is not good.  I don't like this
at all..."
535,LENNY,535,What?
536,TICK,536,"Well, it's cutting awful close to
me.  I mean she was just here."
537,LENNY,537,Who was just here?
538,TICK,538,"Iris, man.  Pay attention."
539,LENNY,539,"Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris
was here?!"
540,TICK,540,"Yeah, she came by last night.
Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to
make a copy of some clip."
541,LENNY,541,What clip?  What was it?
542,TICK,542,"I don't know, man, she wouldn't let
me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to
see it.  She said she was going to
give it to you to hold for her.
Like insurance or somethin'"
543,LENNY,543,She never gave me a tape.
544,MACE,544,"Think back about what she said.
Exactly what she said."
545,LENNY,545,"She wanted to go out to my car,
something about my car..."
546,MACE,546,Something in your car...
547,LENNY,547,"That's a handy little attitude
adjuster."
548,LENNY,548,Damn.  I'm boxed in.
549,MACE,549,What's it say?
550,LENNY,550,Nothing.  Let's go play this back.
551,SPREG,551,Give me the tape.  Right now.
552,LENNY,552,"What tape?  I'm just trying to get
my car back but the place is
closed--"
553,SPREG,553,Shut the fuck up Nero.
554,MACE,554,"Lenny, give them the tape."
555,LENNY,555,"It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going
to open my case..."
556,ENGELMAN,556,"Facing us, where we can see it."
557,LENNY,557,Take it and turn her loose.  Okay?
558,SPREG,558,Absolutely.
559,LENNY,559,"Oh no, we're not being followed,
Lenny, Don't be so paranoid, Lenny."
560,LENNY,560,Shit!
561,MACE,561,"Take it easy.  The glass is bullet
resistant."
562,LENNY,562,"Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened
to bullet proof?"
563,MACE,563,"Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I
do."
564,LENNY,564,Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
565,MACE,565,"It's okay, Lenny"
566,MACE,566,"They'd never get here in time
anyway."
567,MACE,567,This is bad.
568,LENNY,568,"The gas tank's going to go any
second!"
569,LENNY,569,Are you out of your fucking mind?!
570,MACE,570,"Fire's out, isn't it?"
571,MACE,571,"Get in here.  Come on Lenny, move
it.  MOVE!!"
572,MACE,572,Get ready to hold your breath.
573,MACE,573,"Lenny, kick out hard, then just
follow me. Okay?"
574,SPREG,574,Let's get out of here.
575,MACE,575,"I can't believe we had to give them
the damn tape."
576,LENNY,576,"Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my
favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot
tub on my birthday.  I'm going to
really miss it."
577,LENNY,577,Are we impressed yet?
578,CURTIS,578,"I got better things to do on New
Year's Eve than be some kinda damn
chauffeur..."
579,MACE,579,Hey Curtis?  Just drive.
580,LENNY,580,Those two guys were cops.
581,MACE,581,You sure?
582,LENNY,582,"It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway,
they'll run your plates and get your
address.  We gotta keep moving."
583,CECILE,583,"Lornette, girl... what's going on?"
584,MACE,584,"We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey.
We're going to watch fireworks from
there.  Let's go.  Chop chop."
585,ZANDER,585,"Aw, Mom!"
586,LENNY,586,"Come on Zander.  You can ride on my
shoulders.  Here you go."
587,MACE,587,"Cecile, get in the car.  Now."
588,ONE OF THE BOYS,588,"Yo, Mace.  Whatup wit you, homegirl?
You never come roun' here no more."
589,MACE,589,He's with me.
590,MACE,590,Tell me.
591,LENNY,591,"I can't tell you.  You've got to
see."
592,MACE,592,Uh unh.  I won't do it.
593,LENNY,593,"Mace.  I know what you think about
the wire.  But I'm asking you to do
this.  It's that important."
594,LENNY,594,"Sorry this has to be your first
playback."
595,LENNY,595,"Keep your eyes closed, or you'll see
double."
596,JERIKO,596,Shit.  Fuckin' Five-O
597,COP VOICE,597,Go to the bottom of the ramp.
598,JERIKO,598,"Goddamn, now what you pull me over
for?  If I was going any slower I'd
be parked--"
599,COP VOICE 1,599,"Get down on your knees and put your
hands on your head.  Now!"
600,COP VOICE 2,600,"Everyone else, out of the car and
down on the ground."
601,COP VOICE 1,601,"Put your hands behind your head
right now!"
602,ENGELMAN,602,"Put your hands on the hood of the
car and don't move."
603,JERIKO,603,"I suppose you stopped us cause you
had suspects fitting our description
in the area, what you're gonna tell
me.  What was the description?  Two
black males in a car?  Yeah, right,
I heard that one before..."
604,JERIKO,604,"Well you stopped the wrong black
male tonight officer... what is it?
Spreg.  Officer Spreg.  Cause I'm
the 800 pound gorilla in your mist,
fucker.  I make more in a day than
you make in a year, and my lawyers
love to spend my money dragging
sorry-ass Aryan robocops like you
into court.  Get a man down on the
ground with no probable cause.  Fuck
you!"
605,SPREG,605,Shut the fuck up!
606,DIAMANDA,606,"Leave the fuck off of us, we weren't
doing anything..."
607,SPREG,607,"Shut up!  Don't make me walk over
there."
608,SPREG,608,"You're that rap puke?  Jeriko One?
You're the one getting all the
gangbangers to form citizens groups
and go downtown... trying to rake
the LAPD over a cheese grater?"
609,JERIKO,609,"That's right.  And you're gonna be
in my next song, motherfucker, it's
called Robo-Spreg."
610,JERIKO,610,"It's a song about a cop who meets
his worst nightmare, a nigger with
enough political juice to crush his
ass like a stink bug.  You're gonna
be famous."
611,SPREG,611,I don't think so.
612,SPREG,612,Hey... I don't hear you laughing!
613,SPREG,613,Get the bitches.
614,LENNY,614,"Hang on.  Hang on, Max."
615,LENNY,615,You see?
616,MACE,616,I see.
617,MACE,617,"I see the earth opening up and
swallowing us all."
618,LENNY,618,Yeah I know.
619,LENNY,619,So what do we do?
620,MAX,620,"Don't talk to anybody.  Anybody.
You're invisible.  Okay?  Just meet
me at Tick's in a half hour.  And
Lenny... don't get pulled over."
621,LENNY,621,"We got to make another copy of this.
Little life insurance."
622,MACE,622,"You know what this tape could do if it
gets out."
623,LENNY,623,"I've got a good idea, yeah."
624,MACE,624,"People finding out... seeing... that
the LAPD just flat out executed
Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they
ought to see."
625,LENNY,625,"Maybe.  But tonight is probably not
the best night.  Come on, we're
rollin'."
626,CECILE,626,"Lornette, when you gonna stop laying
off everything on me?  We had plans
tonight--"
627,MACE,627,"Listen to me, little sister.
There's something going on, and it's
very big.  Now you've got to take
care of Zander.  And stay off the
streets tonight... you hear me on
this?"
628,MACE,628,"Curtis.  What about you?  Do we
understand each other?  You stay
put."
629,CURTIS,629,Yeah.  I'm wit it.
630,CURTIS,630,Damn!  She worse than you.
631,LENNY,631,"So, let's see, I've got Tran's
goons, some squidhead psycho and the
LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy
new year, Lenny."
632,MACE,632,"Well, look at the plus side."
633,LENNY,633,There's a plus side?
634,MACE,634,"Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape
to save me.  That's real progress
for you."
635,LENNY,635,It was a tough call.
636,MACE,636,"I still can't square the psycho
smarts of whoever did Iris with
those two cops."
637,LENNY,637,"I don't think those cops did Iris.
I think whoever Iris was wearing for
killed her."
638,MACE,638,Why?
639,LENNY,639,"To break the trail.  If those cops
had gotten hold of her, they would
have beat it out of her who she was
wearing for, and then gone after
them too.  Our killer is running as
scared as we are.  Which makes him
really dangerous.  Judging by how
scared I am."
640,MAX,640,"Sounds like Tick's already
celebrating."
641,LENNY,641,"You may be a little overdressed for
this party."
642,LENNY,642,"Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!"
643,LENNY,643,"Tick, I got to talk to you, man...
oh shit."
644,LENNY,644,He's been cooked-off
645,MAX,645,Is he dead?
646,LENNY,646,"No.  But his frontal lobes are like
two runny eggs.  They put an
amplifier in-line to boost the
signal till it french-fried his
brain."
647,LENNY,647,"He's totally cut off from the outer
world."
648,MACE,648,How long does it last?
649,MACE,649,Oh.
650,MAX,650,"Those two psycho cops are on a
slash-and-burn to find the tape and
cover their tracks."
651,MACE,651,"This seems a little sophisticated
for them.  These are not subtle
guys."
652,MAX,652,"There's more to this whole thing
than you think."
653,LENNY,653,Whattya mean?
654,MAX,654,"All I'm saying... you don't know how
high up the food chain this thing
goes.  I've heard stuff."
655,LENNY,655,What stuff?
656,MAX,656,"Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff
about a death squad.  A group a guys
loyal to the hardline school.  Guys
that've had too many years of city
hall and the review boards and the
goddamn media pissing down their
necks, suspending cops right and
left, tying their hands... while
outa the other side a their mouths
these same people're squealing save
us, save us, do something you
fucking morons, crime is totally out
of control."
657,LENNY,657,Jesus.
658,MAX,658,"Yeah.  So don't walk near me in
public, alright."
659,LENNY,659,"Thanks, buddy.  See... things
weren't bad enough.  They weren't
fucking bad enough!"
660,MACE,660,"The only card we have to play is the
tape.  You know, we get it to the
media somehow..."
661,LENNY,661,"Yeah, right, blow it open."
662,MAX,662,"Mace... no disrespect... but you run
this on the 11 o'clock news, by
midnight you got the biggest riot in
history.  They'll see the fucking
smoke from Canada."
663,LENNY,663,Okay... what about Strickland?
664,MAX,664,No.  Bad idea.
665,MACE,665,Who's Strickland?
666,LENNY,666,"Deputy Commissioner Palmer
Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick
who busted me out.  His ass is so
tight when he farts only dogs can
hear it.  I know this guy.  If
there's one cop who's not dirty
it's him."
667,MAX,667,"Listen to me, Lenny... stay away
from cops.  All cops.  You have no
way of knowing who you can trust."
668,MACE,668,"So you're saying we just pretend is
didn't happen?  It happened!  The
LAPD executed one of the most
important black men in America!  Who
the fuck are you to bury this?!"
669,MAX,669,"Fine.  Do you want blood running
waist deep in the storm drains?  The
gangbangers'll spread like a wave
through this city and burn it to the
ground.  And when the fires start
the street cops'll be capping off at
anything that moves.  It'll be all-
out war and you know it."
670,MACE,670,"Yeah, well maybe it's time for a
war!"
671,MAX,671,You really want that on your head?
672,LENNY,672,"Hey, Max, Mace... whoa... time out."
673,MAX/MACE,673,What!?
674,LENNY,674,"Whoever killed Iris did Tick.  It's
the same sick wirehead shit.  Same
reason... to burn the trail.  If
Faith knows anything about this, and
I think she does, then she's on the
list.  So... who's driving?"
675,FAITH,675,"Lenny!  Jesus!  You scared the Hell
out of me."
676,FAITH,676,What's going on?
677,LENNY,677,"Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris
made me a copy of the tape."
678,FAITH,678,"Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep
you out of this."
679,LENNY,679,"How did it happen?  What was Iris
doing riding around with Jeriko
wearing a wire?"
680,FAITH,680,We should talk alone.
681,LENNY,681,No.  Mace is in this.
682,MACE,682,Tell us.
683,FAITH,683,"Tran's gotten obsesses with
playback, a total wiretrip junkie.
And he's such a control freak, he's
been having people followed,
videotaped... recording his business
partners' calls.  Wiring up people
left and right."
684,TRAN,684,Let's go get her.  We're late.
685,MAX,685,"Tran, listen.  I was wondering how
you want me to work it tonight, down
at the Bonaventure.  You want me
downstairs at the party or upstairs
at the suite?  Where you going to
be, mostly?"
686,FAITH,686,"Tran and Jeriko weren't getting
along.  He was afraid Jeriko was
getting ready to dump him, but he
wasn't sure, so he started with the
surveillance.  A couple nights ago
he wires up Iris and sends her and
the other girl, Diamanda, over to
Jeriko's table."
687,FAITH,687,"That night Iris calls up, freaking.
She comes over and Tran watches the
tape.  He just loses it.  He can't
believe the disaster she's gotten
him into.  He's terrified the cops
will beat it out of her who she was
working for, and come looking for
him."
688,LENNY,688,"Kinda guy you can count on in a
pinch."
689,MACE,689,"Why didn't he just go public with
the tape?  Save himself that way."
690,FAITH,690,"The scandal would wipe him out.  If
it got out that he had his own
artists under surveillance... he'd
lose all his other acts.  He'd be
over."
691,FAITH,691,"So finally he gives Iris some cash
and tells her to check into the
hotel under a wrong name till he
figures out what to do."
692,LENNY,692,"Yeah... he figured out what to do
all right."
693,FAITH,693,You think Tran killed her?
694,LENNY,694,"The killer knew right where she was.
Because he put her there."
695,FAITH,695,What a nightmare.
696,TRAN,696,"Go get her, Joey.  Stupid bitch."
697,TRAN,697,We'll talk about this later.
698,MACE,698,Come on.  We're out of here.
699,LENNY,699,"Leave here with me, right now."
700,FAITH,700,"Okay, Lenny.  My guardian angel."
701,TEX,701,Teach you...
702,TEX,702,to mess with...
703,TEX,703,a helpless cripple!
704,CORTO,704,Not here.  Lets go.
705,MAX,705,"Everything's cool.  Too much to
drink."
706,MACE,706,"Yeah, uh... he slipped on the
stairs.  We're taking him to
emergency."
707,MACE,707,Excuse me.
708,COP,708,Go to Cedars.  It's closest.
709,FAITH,709,"Well, I'm certainly in the mood for
a party."
710,TRAN,710,Take her up to the suite.
711,TRAN,711,"Have a glass of champagne... or
six... I'll be up in a while to help
you ring in the New Year."
712,FAITH,712,I live for the moment.
713,MACE,713,"You are a pussy-whipped sorry-ass
motherfucker, you know that?"
714,LENNY,714,Owww!!  Take it easy.
715,LENNY,715,Uh huh.  So where are they now?
716,MAX,716,"He's got her up in the room, under
guard.  And he's still working the
party... acting smooth like nothin's
nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work
a trade."
717,LENNY (V.O.),717,What do you mean?
718,MAX,718,"Give him the tape.  See?  It's
fucking brilliant!  The tape for
Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I
can set it up."
719,LENNY (V.O.),719,"This is what we laughingly refer to
as a plan, right?"
720,MAX,720,"Come on!  If he gives us any shit,
we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?"
721,MAX,721,"Just get your butt down here.  If
I'm not at the shindig downstairs
go to the room.  It's 2203.  You
writin'?"
722,LENNY,722,2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
723,MAX (V.O.),723,I intend to.
724,LENNY,724,"Okay, we gotta get over there."
725,LENNY,725,"Can you borrow a dress from Cecile
or something--"
726,MACE,726,I'm not going.
727,LENNY,727,"Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's
gonna do her right there unless--"
728,MACE,728,"Lenny... shutup.  Just park your
mouth and listen.  It's a set-up.
Think about it!  Why's he been
sending you tapes?  To freak you,
get you to rush in without thinking.
Then they put one in you, put one in
her, put the gun in your hand...
crime of passion.  This guy's bent
enough to think of that."
729,LENNY,729,That sounds right.
730,LENNY,730,I'm going.
731,MACE,731,"You gonna get yourself killed for
this?  This toxic-waste bitch!"
732,LENNY,732,What the fuck are you doing?!
733,MACE,733,"Lenny!  This is your life, Lenny!
Right here.  Right now.  This is
realtime... not playback.  Real...
time.  Time to get real.  Understand
what I'm saying... she doesn't love
you.  Maybe she did once, I don't
know, but she doesn't now.  These
are used emotions.  It's time to
trade them in."
734,MACE,734,"Lenny, memories were meant to fade.
They're designed that way for a
reason."
735,LENNY,735,"Have you ever been in love with
somebody who didn't return that
love?"
736,MACE,736,Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
737,LENNY,737,"It didn't stop you from loving them.
Right?  Or understanding them, or
being able to forgive them..."
738,MACE,738,I guess.
739,LENNY,739,"And it didn't stop you from wanting
to protect them.  Did it?"
740,MACE,740,No.  It didn't.
741,LENNY,741,"I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent
Crimes... and I saw every known
depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In
outer darkness.  Then I busted this
strung-out little teeny-hooker.
When I met Faith she was just
another runaway giving twenty dollar
blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost
soul."
742,MACE,742,You never told me.
743,LENNY,743,"But she was different.  There was a
light in her eyes... and she had
this voice.  It was scary, all that
pain coming out of that little body.
Like she could take all the hurt and
rage of the entire world and lift it
up to heaven in one voice.  I helped
her.  And I promised her that I'd
always be there... to protect her."
744,LENNY,744,"See?  It's not about what's in her
head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't
let go of the promise.  It's...
like... it's all I have left."
745,MACE,745,"No, it's not."
746,MACE,746,"Come on, Lenny.  Let's go to a
party."
747,MACE,747,That's it.  Let's bail.
748,LENNY,748,Mace... you're a girl.
749,MACE,749,"Good, Lenny.  I can see why the
detective gig didn't work out.  Come
on."
750,LENNY,750,Got your ticket?
751,MACE,751,"No.  They must have sent it to my
beach house by mistake."
752,LENNY,752,You see Tran?
753,MACE,753,Uh unh.
754,LENNY,754,"Come on, Max.  Come on, buddy..."
755,LENNY,755,Damnit.
756,LENNY,756,Alright.  We're going up.
757,MACE,757,"And do what?  Take on his whole
posse?"
758,LENNY,758,"I still got one ace to play.  Tran's
got what I want... and I've got what
he wants..."
759,MACE,759,"That's the original.  There are no
copies."
760,LENNY,760,"Exactly.  That's why it's a make-
able deal."
761,MACE,761,"Look.  That tape is a lightning bolt
from God.  It's worth more than you,
more than me, more than Faith.  You
understand?  It can change things.
Things that need changing before we
all go off the end of the road.  And
you do not have the right to use it
for currency."
762,MACE,762,"You go... you go alone.  This is
where I draw the line.  I care about
you Lenny... a lot more than you
know... which makes us both pretty
stupid.  But you pawn that tape, you
mean nothing to me."
763,MACE,763,"Ah, hell.  Lenny--"
764,LENNY,764,See that guy?
765,LENNY,765,"The one with the ramrod up his ass.
That's Strickland."
766,LENNY,766,Take it to him.
767,MACE,767,A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
768,LENNY,768,No.  Trust me.
769,MACE,769,Oh boy.
770,MACE,770,What if you're wrong?
771,LENNY,771,"Then we'll be right where we are
now."
772,MACE,772,"Yeah, right.  Fucked."
773,STRICKLAND,773,Yes?
774,MACE,774,"There's a tape in there you need to
see.  I mean right now."
775,STRICKLAND,775,"If it wasn't New Year's Eve, I'd
arrest you for possession of illegal
equipment--"
776,MACE,776,"Just look at the tape!  You want to
know who killed Jeriko One?  Go in
the stall right now and hit Play."
777,YOUNG COP,777,"Sir, is there a problem here?"
778,MACE,778,Damn!  I knew it--
779,LENNY,779,"Now, Wade, can we talk here, like
two human beings--"
780,LENNY,780,It's not personal.
781,CORTO,781,"Aw, not the fucking nose!!"
782,VITA,782,"Hey, enjoy the party."
783,FAITH,783,Oh.  I didn't hear you come in.
784,LENNY,784,"No, no, no..."
785,FAITH,785,I love you.
786,TRAN,786,"You're going to die, you're both
going to fucking die."
787,MAX,787,"This piece of puke hired me to kill
you, baby.  Do you believe that?
Isn't that right, Tran?  You
pinhead."
788,FAITH,788,"Oh my God.  I don't believe this is
happening."
789,MAX,789,"Believe it.  Now bring me the
trodes, baby.  Come on, quick."
790,FAITH,790,What're you going to do?
791,FAITH,791,You can't just... kill him.
792,MAX,792,I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
793,FAITH,793,Jesus.
794,MAX,794,"Hey, he was going to kill you.  And
this ratfuck paid to have Iris
killed, to save his own sorry ass."
795,MAX,795,"You shut the fuck up, right now,
I'm gonna pull this fuckin' trigger!"
796,MAX,796,"Look, baby, it's now of never... the
guy is a known input junkie, so a
little OD won't surprise anybody.
It's the only way we can be
together.  You know it's true."
797,FAITH,797,My God.
798,MAX,798,"Here's how much I love you, baby."
799,MAX,799,"Don't make any assumptions about our
friendship, Lenny."
800,LENNY,800,"No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know
you were colorblind, Max."
801,MAX,801,Only way I could stand your ties.
802,MAX,802,I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
803,LENNY,803,Where's Faith?
804,MAX,804,"I sent her to the party.  I figured
I'd wait up here until you killed
Tran."
805,LENNY,805,"What makes you think I'm gonna kill
Tran?"
806,MAX,806,You just did.
807,LENNY,807,Jesus!
808,MAX,808,"You know, statistically that's the
second most common word people say
right before they die.  Shit being
number one."
809,LENNY,809,"So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran
in, being on his payroll, and shot
me."
810,MAX,810,"That's pretty much the way it
happened."
811,LENNY,811,"Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering.
I killed Iris too, didn't I?"
812,MAX,812,"That's right.  They'll find the
original of her snuff clip in your
apartment.  The one I left for you
at the club was a copy."
813,LENNY,813,"Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do
Tick too?"
814,MAX,814,You bet.  Did you like it?
815,LENNY,815,"So why Max... why d'ya have to do
Iris?  She never hurt anybody."
816,MAX,816,"Picture it... I feel like I gotta
share this with somebody.  It's too
perfect."
817,LENNY,817,I won't say anything.
818,MAX,818,"I know.  So, I'm working for this
puke, right?  And he says he'll pay
me quite large to do the hooker.
But also I gotta do his bitch
girlfriend cause she knows the whole
score and she's totally out of
control."
819,MAX,819,"Only he doesn't know about me and
Faith.  So I say to myself, if I
turn the job down, he just gets
somebody else.  And I lose Faith...
to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I
do the skank.  I still gotta do
something about Tran... I figure
it's him or me... but I can't cap
him without a chump to take the
fall.  And who better than his
girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a
known criminal... who has been seen
hassling them in public numerous
times."
820,LENNY,820,"And who was, regrettably, also your
best fucking friend."
821,MAX,821,"No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey,
cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten
minutes anyway."
822,LENNY,822,"You must be so pleased, I followed
your jellybean trail right here,
like a good little chump."
823,MAX,823,You got froggy on me a couple times.
824,MAX (V.O.),824,"I thought that riff about the Death
Squad was pretty good.  I hadda keep
you from bringing the cops into it."
825,LENNY,825,So there never was a death squad.
826,MAX,826,Naawww.
827,LENNY,827,"Just those two loose-cannon cops
running around covering their butts."
828,MAX,828,"Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this
shit caused by a random traffic
stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing.
You know that.  Look around... the
whole planet's in total chaos.  You
gotta take what you can, while you
can.  Cause some shitbird can come
up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back
a your head any second."
829,LENNY,829,How did you hook up with Faith?
830,MAX,830,"This dink hires me a month ago to
eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows
me from you, right, so she comes up
to me and says, 'Hey Max why you
following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you
a drink and explain.' And she says..."
831,FAITH,831,"'So, do you enjoy watching me?'"
832,MAX,832,"You were supposed to go downstairs,
baby."
833,FAITH,833,"I know.  I don't always do exactly
what I'm told."
834,FAITH,834,"So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching
me?'  And you said -- come on Max."
835,MAX,835,"I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for
free.'"
836,FAITH,836,"Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good,
because I like the feeling of
someone watching me.  I acquired
the taste from Lenny.'"
837,MAX,837,"And then she said, 'Since we're
going to be spending so much time
together--'"
838,FAITH,838,"'We might as well make the best of
it.'"
839,LENNY,839,"Jesus, Faith."
840,FAITH,840,Lenny!!
841,MAX,841,Fucking bitch!!
842,MACE,842,All the way down!  RIGHT NOW!!
843,MACE,843,"Wait.  Let me tell you what's going
on here--"
844,MACE,844,NO!!  NO!!!
845,STRICKLAND,845,"These two are under arrest for
murder."
846,STRICKLAND,846,"Get some medical attention for this
woman."
847,LENNY,847,Are you okay?
848,MACE,848,"I got 'em, Lenny."
849,LENNY,849,SHOOT!
850,SPREG,850,YOU FUCKING NIGGER BITCH!!
851,LENNY,851,"Yeah, what?"
852,MACE,852,Are we under arrest?
853,LENNY,853,"Naw.  They just have to ask us a
few questions... for about six
hours."
854,CROWD,854,TEN!  NINE!  EIGHT!...
855,CROWD,855,SEVEN!  SIX!  FIVE!...
856,CROWD,856,"FOUR!  THREE!  TWO!  ONE!  HAPPY NEW
YEAR!"
857,MACE,857,"Hey, Lenny.  We made it."
858,LENNY,858,Yeah.  We did.
859,MACE,859,Well...
860,MACE,860,Get going.  You're still bleeding.
861,LENNY,861,See you downtown.
862,MACE,862,Yeah.  See you there.
