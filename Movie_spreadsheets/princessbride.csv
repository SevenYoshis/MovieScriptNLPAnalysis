0,MOTHER,0,You feeling any better?
1,THE KID,1,A little bit.
2,MOTHER,2,Guess what.
3,THE KID,3,What?
4,MOTHER,4,Your grandfather's here.
5,THE KID,5,"Mom, can't you tell him that I'm
sick?"
6,MOTHER,6,"You are sick, that's why he's here."
7,THE KID,7,He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
8,MOTHER,8,Maybe he won't.
9,GRANDFATHER,9,Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?
10,MOTHER,10,I think I'll leave you two pals.
11,GRANDFATHER,11,I brought you a special present.
12,THE KID,12,What is it?
13,GRANDFATHER,13,Open it up.
14,THE KID,14,A book?
15,GRANDFATHER,15,"That's right. When I was your
age, television was called books.
And this is a special book. It
was the book my father used to
read to me when I was sick, and I
used to read it to your father.
And today, I'm gonna read it to
you."
16,THE KID,16,Has it got any sports in it?
17,GRANDFATHER,17,"Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters.
Chases. Escapes. True love.
Miracles."
18,THE KID,18,"It doesn't sound too bad. I'll
try and stay awake."
19,GRANDFATHER,19,"Oh. Well, thank you very much.
It's very nice of you. Your vote
of confidence is overwhelming.
All right."
20,GRANDFATHER,20,"The Princess Bride, by S.
Morgenstern. Chapter One.
Buttercup was raised on a small
farm in the country of Florin."
21,GRANDFATHER,21,"Her favorite pastimes were riding
her horse and tormenting the farm
boy that worked there. His name
was Westley, but she never called
him that."
22,GRANDFATHER,22,Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
23,THE KID,23,Yeah. It's really good.
24,GRANDFATHER,24,"Nothing gave Buttercup as much
pleasure as ordering Westley
around."
25,BUTTERCUP,25,"Farm boy. Polish my horse's
saddle. I want to see my face
shining in it by morning."
26,WESTLEY,26,As you wish.
27,GRANDFATHER,27,"""As you wish"" was all he ever
said to her."
28,BUTTERCUP,28,Farm Boy. Fill these with water --
29,BUTTERCUP,29,--please.
30,WESTLEY,30,As you wish.
31,GRANDFATHER,31,"That day, she was amazed to
discover that when he was saying,
""As you wish,"" what he meant was,
""I love you."""
32,GRANDFATHER,32,"And even more amazing was the day
she realized she truly loved him
back."
33,BUTTERCUP,33,"Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher."
34,WESTLEY,34,As you wish.
35,THE KID,35,"-hold it, hold it-"
36,THE KID,36,"What is this? Are you trying to
trick me? -- Where's the sports? --
Is this a kissing book?"
37,GRANDFATHER,37,"-- wait, just wait --"
38,THE KID,38,"-- well, when does it get good?"
39,GRANDFATHER,39,Keep your shirt on. Let me read.
40,GRANDFATHER,40,"Westley had no money for marriage.
So he packed his few belongings
and left the farm to seek his
fortune across the sea."
41,GRANDFATHER,41,"It was a very emotional time for
Buttercup --"
42,THE KID,42,I don't be-leeve this.
43,BUTTERCUP,43,I fear I'll never see you again.
44,WESTLEY,44,Of course you will.
45,BUTTERCUP,45,"But what if something happens to
you?"
46,WESTLEY,46,Hear this now: I will come for you.
47,BUTTERCUP,47,But how can you be sure?
48,WESTLEY,48,"This is true love. You think this
happens every day?"
49,GRANDFATHER,49,"Westley didn't reach his
destination. His ship was attacked
by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who
never left captives alive. When
Buttercup got the news that
Westley was murdered --"
50,THE KID,50,-- murdered by pirates is good --
51,GRANDFATHER,51,"She went into her room and shut
the door. And for days, she
neither slept nor ate."
52,BUTTERCUP,52,I will never love again.
53,GRANDFATHER,53,"Five years later, the main square
of Florin City was filled as
never before to hear the
announcement of the great Prince
Humperdinck's bride-to be."
54,HUMPERDINCK,54,"My people ... a month from now,
our country will have its 500th
anniversary. On that sundown, I
shall marry a lady who was once a
commoner like yourselves --"
55,HUMPERDINCK,55,"-- but perhaps you will not find
her common now. Would you like to
meet her?"
56,HUMPERDINCK,56,"My people ... the Princess
Buttercup!!"
57,GRANDFATHER,57,"Buttercup's emptiness consumed
her. Although the law of the land
gave Humperdinck the right to
choose his bride, she did not
love him."
58,GRANDFATHER,58,"Despite Humperdinck's reassurance
that she would grow to love him,
the only joy she found was in her
daily ride."
59,VOICE,59,"A word, my lady?"
60,VIZZINI,60,"We are but poor, lost circus
performers. Is there a village
nearby?"
61,BUTTERCUP,61,"There is nothing nearby; not for
miles."
62,VIZZINI,62,"Then there will be no one to hear
you scream-"
63,INIGO,63,What is that you're ripping?
64,VIZZINI,64,"It's fabric from the uniform of
an Army officer of Guilder."
65,FEZZIK,65,Who's Guilder?
66,VIZZINI,66,"The country across the sea. The
sworn enemy of Florin."
67,VIZZINI,67,Go!
68,VIZZINI,68,"Once the horse reaches the
castle, the fabric will make the
Prince suspect the Guilderians
have abducted his love. When he
finds her body dead on the
Guilder frontier, his suspicions
will be totally confirmed."
69,FEZZIK,69,"You never said anything about
killing anyone."
70,VIZZINI,70,"I've hired you to help me start a
war. That's a prestigious line of
work with a long and glorious
tradition."
71,FEZZIK,71,"I just don't think it's right,
killing an innocent girl."
72,VIZZINI,72,"Am I going mad or did the word
""think"" escape your lips? You
were not hired for your brains,
you hippopotamic land mass."
73,INIGO,73,I agree with Fezzik.
74,VIZZINI,74,"Oh. The sot has spoken. What
happens to her is not truly your
concern -- I will kill her --"
75,VIZZINI,75,"And remember this -- never forget
this --"
76,VIZZINI,76,"-- when I found you, you were so
slobbering drunk you couldn't buy
brandy --"
77,VIZZINI,77,"-- and you -- friendless,
brainless, helpless, hopeless --
Do you want me to send you back
to where you were, unemployed in
Greenland?"
78,INIGO,78,"That Vizzini, he can fuss."
79,FEZZIK,79,... fuss ... fuss ...
80,FEZZIK,80,I think he likes to scream at us.
81,INIGO,81,Probably he means no harm.
82,FEZZIK,82,He's really very short on charm.
83,INIGO,83,"Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme."
84,FEZZIK,84,"Yes, some of the time."
85,VIZZINI,85,Enough of that.
86,INIGO,86,"FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?"
87,FEZZIK,87,"If there are, we'll all be dead."
88,VIZZINI,88,"No more rhymes now, I mean it."
89,FEZZIK,89,Anybody want a peanut?
90,VIZZINI,90,We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.
91,VIZZINI,91,Why are you doing that?
92,INIGO,92,Making sure nobody's following us.
93,VIZZINI,93,That would be inconceivable.
94,BUTTERCUP,94,"Despite what you think, you will
be caught. And when you are, the
Prince will see you all hanged."
95,VIZZINI,95,"Of all the necks on this boat,
Highness, the one you should be
worrying about is your own."
96,VIZZINI,96,"Stop doing that. We can all
relax, it's almost over-"
97,INIGO,97,You're sure nobody's following us?
98,VIZZINI,98,"As I told you, it would be
absolutely, totally, and in all
other ways, inconceivable. No one
in Guilder knows what we've done.
And no one in Florin could have
gotten here so fast. Out of
curiosity, why do you ask?"
99,INIGO,99,"No reason. It's only, I just
happened to look behind us, and
something is there."
100,VIZZINI,100,What?
101,VIZZINI,101,"Probably some local fisherman out
for a pleasure cruise at night
through eel-infested waters."
102,VIZZINI,102,"Go in, get after her!"
103,INIGO,103,I don't swim.
104,FEZZIK,104,I only dog paddle.
105,VIZZINI,105,Veer left. Left. Left!
106,VIZZINI,106,"Do you know what that sound is,
Highness? Those are the Shrieking
Eels -- if you doubt me, just
wait. They always grow louder
when they're about to feed on
human flesh."
107,VIZZINI,107,"If you swim back now, I promise,
no harm will come to you. I doubt
you will get such an offer from
the Eels."
108,GRANDFATHER,108,"She doesn't get eaten by the Eels
at this time."
109,THE KID,109,What?
110,GRANDFATHER,110,"The Eel doesn't get her. I'm
explaining to you because you
looked nervous."
111,THE KID,111,"Well, I wasn't nervous."
112,THE KID,112,"Well, maybe I was a little bit
concerned. But that's not the
same thing."
113,GRANDFATHER,113,Because I can stop now if you want.
114,THE KID,114,"No. You could read a little bit
more ... if you want."
115,GRANDFATHER,115,"""Do you know what that sound is,
Highness?"""
116,VIZZINI,116,Those are the Shrieking Eels.
117,THE KID,117,"We're past that, Grandpa."
118,THE KID,118,You read it already.
119,GRANDFATHER,119,"Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm
sorry. Beg your pardon."
120,GRANDFATHER,120,"All right, all right, let's see.
Uh, she was in the water, the Eel
was coming after her. She was
frightened. The Eel started to
charge her. And then -"
121,VIZZINI,121,Put her down. Just put her down.
122,INIGO,122,I think he's getting closer.
123,VIZZINI,123,He's no concern of ours. Sail on!
124,VIZZINI,124,"I suppose you think you're brave,
don't you?"
125,BUTTERCUP,125,Only compared to some.
126,INIGO,126,"Look! He's right on top of us. I
wonder if he is using the same
wind we are using."
127,VIZZINI,127,"Whoever he is, he's too late --"
128,VIZZINI,128,-- see?
129,VIZZINI,129,The Cliffs of Insanity.
130,VIZZINI,130,"Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ...
that other thing. Move it!"
131,VIZZINI,131,"We're safe -- only FEZZIK is
strong enough to go up our way --
he'll have to sail around for
hours 'til he finds a harbor."
132,INIGO,132,"He's climbing the rope. And he's
gaining on us."
133,VIZZINI,133,Inconceivable!
134,VIZZINI,134,Faster!
135,FEZZIK,135,I thought I was going faster.
136,VIZZINI,136,"You were supposed to be this
colossus. You were this great,
legendary thing. And yet he gains."
137,FEZZIK,137,"Well, I'm carrying three people.
And he's got only himself."
138,VIZZINI,138,-- I do not accept excuses.
139,VIZZINI,139,"I'm just going to have to find
myself a new giant, that's all."
140,FEZZIK,140,"Don't say that, Vizzini. Please."
141,VIZZINI,141,"Did I make it clear that your job
is at stake?"
142,FEZZIK,142,He has very good arms.
143,VIZZINI,143,He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
144,INIGO,144,"You keep using that word -- I do
not think it means what you think
it means."
145,INIGO,145,My God! He's climbing.
146,VIZZINI,146,"Whoever he is, he's obviously
seen us with the Princess, and
must therefore die."
147,VIZZINI,147,"You, carry her."
148,VIZZINI,148,"We'll head straight for the
Guilder frontier. Catch up when
he's dead. If he falls, fine. If
not, the sword."
149,INIGO,149,I want to duel him left-handed.
150,VIZZINI,150,You know what a hurry we're in.
151,INIGO,151,"Well, it's the only way I can be
satisfied. If I use my right --
tch -- over too quickly."
152,VIZZINI,152,"Oh, have it your way."
153,FEZZIK,153,You be careful.
154,FEZZIK,154,"-- people in masks cannot be
trusted."
155,VIZZINI,155,I'm waiting!
156,INIGO,156,Hello there.
157,INIGO,157,Slow going?
158,MAN IN BLACK,158,"Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but this is not as easy as it
looks. So I'd appreciate it if
you wouldn't distract me."
159,INIGO,159,Sorry.
160,MAN IN BLACK,160,Thank you.
161,INIGO,161,"I do not suppose you could speed
things up?"
162,MAN IN BLACK,162,"If you're in such a hurry, you
could lower a rope, or a tree
branch, or find something useful
to do."
163,INIGO,163,"I could do that. In fact, I've
got some rope up here. But I do
not think that you will accept my
help, since I am only waiting
around to kill you."
164,MAN IN BLACK,164,"That does put a damper on our
relationship."
165,INIGO,165,"But I promise I will not kill you
until you reach the top."
166,MAN IN BLACK,166,"That's very comforting. But I'm
afraid you'll just have to wait."
167,INIGO,167,"I hate waiting. I could give you
my word as a Spaniard."
168,MAN IN BLACK,168,"No good. I've known too many
Spaniards."
169,INIGO,169,"You don't know any way you'll
trust me?"
170,MAN IN BLACK,170,Nothing comes to mind.
171,INIGO,171,"I swear on the soul of my father,
Domingo Montoya, you will reach
the top alive."
172,MAN IN BLACK,172,Throw me the rope.
173,MAN IN BLACK,173,Thank you.
174,INIGO,174,We'll wait until you're ready.
175,MAN IN BLACK,175,Again. Thank you.
176,INIGO,176,"I do not mean to pry, but you
don't by any chance happen to
have six fingers on your right
hand?"
177,MAN IN BLACK,177,"Do you always begin conversations
this way?"
178,INIGO,178,"My father was slaughtered by a
sixfingered man. He was a great
swordmaker, my father. And when
the six-fingered man appeared and
requested a special sword, my
father took the job. He slaved a
year before he was done."
179,MAN IN BLACK,179,I have never seen its equal.
180,INIGO,180,"The six-fingered man returned and
demanded it, but at one-tenth his
promised price. My father refused.
Without a word, the six-fingered
man slashed him through the heart.
I loved my father, so, naturally,
challenged his murderer to a duel
... I failed ..."
181,INIGO (CONT'D),181,"the six-fingered man did leave me
alive with the six-fingered
sword, but he gave me these."
182,MAN IN BLACK,182,How old were you?
183,INIGO,183,"I was eleven years old. When I
was strong enough, I dedicated my
life to the study of fencing. So
the next time we meet, I will not
fail. I will go up to the
sixfingered man and say, ""Hello,
my name is Inigo Montoya. You
killed my father. Prepare to die."""
184,MAN IN BLACK,184,"You've done nothing but study
swordplay?"
185,INIGO,185,"More pursuit than study lately.
You see, I cannot find him. It's
been twenty years now. I am
starting to lose confidence. I
just work for Vizzini to pay the
bills. There's not a lot of money
in revenge."
186,MAN IN BLACK,186,"Well, I certainly hope you find
him, someday."
187,INIGO,187,"You are ready, then?"
188,MAN IN BLACK,188,"Whether I am or not, you've been
more than fair."
189,INIGO,189,"You seem a decent fellow. I hate
to kill you."
190,MAN IN BLACK,190,"You seem a decent fellow. I hate
to die."
191,INIGO,191,Begin!
192,INIGO,192,"You're using Bonetti's defense
against me, ah?"
193,MAN IN BLACK,193,"I thought it fitting, considering
the rocky terrain --"
194,INIGO,194,"Naturally, you must expect me to
attack with Capo Ferro."
195,MAN IN BLACK,195,-- naturally --
196,MAN IN BLACK,196,"--but I find Thibault cancels out
Capo Ferro, don't you?"
197,INIGO,197,"Unless the enemy has studied his
Agrippa-"
198,INIGO,198,-- which I have.
199,INIGO,199,You are wonderful!
200,MAN IN BLACK,200,"Thank you -- I've worked hard to
become so."
201,INIGO,201,"I admit it -- you are better than
I am."
202,MAN IN BLACK,202,Then why are you smiling?
203,INIGO,203,"Because I know something you
don't know."
204,MAN IN BLACK,204,And what is that?
205,INIGO,205,I am not left-handed.
206,MAN IN BLACK,206,You're amazing!
207,INIGO,207,I ought to be after twenty years.
208,MAN IN BLACK,208,"There's something I ought to tell
you."
209,INIGO,209,Tell me.
210,MAN IN BLACK,210,I am not left-handed either.
211,INIGO,211,Who are you?!
212,MAN IN BLACK,212,No one of consequence.
213,INIGO,213,I must know.
214,MAN IN BLACK,214,Get used to disappointment.
215,INIGO,215,Okay.
216,INIGO,216,Kill me quickly.
217,MAN IN BLACK,217,"I would as soon destroy a stained
glass window as an artist like
yourself. However, since I can't
have you following me either --"
218,MAN IN BLACK,218,"Please understand, I hold you in
the highest respect."
219,VIZZINI,219,Inconceivable!
220,VIZZINI,220,Give her to me.
221,VIZZINI,221,Catch up with us quickly.
222,FEZZIK,222,What do I do?
223,VIZZINI,223,"Finish him, finish him. Your way."
224,FEZZIK,224,"Oh, good, my way. Thank you,
Vizzini."
225,FEZZIK,225,Which way is my way?
226,VIZZINI,226,"Pick up one of those rocks, get
behind the boulder, and in a few
minutes, the Man in Black will
come running around the bend. The
minute his head is in view, hit
it with the rock!"
227,FEZZIK,227,My way's not very sportsmanlike.
228,FEZZIK,228,"I did that on purpose. I don't
have to miss."
229,MAN IN BLACK,229,"I believe you -- So what happens
now?"
230,FEZZIK,230,"We face each other as God intended.
Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no
weapons, skill against skill alone."
231,MAN IN BLACK,231,"You mean, you'll put down your
rock and I'll put down my sword,
and we'll try to kill each other
like civilized people?"
232,FEZZIK,232,I could kill you now.
233,MAN IN BLACK,233,"Frankly, I think the odds are
slightly in your favor at hand
fighting."
234,FEZZIK,234,"It's not my fault being the
biggest and the strongest. I
don't even exercise."
235,MAN IN BLACK,235,"Look are you just fiddling around
with me or what?"
236,FEZZIK,236,"I just want you to feel you're
doing well. I hate for people to
die embarrassed."
237,FEZZIK,237,You're quick.
238,MAN IN BLACK,238,And a good thing too.
239,FEZZIK,239,"Why do you wear a mask? Were you
burned by acid, or something like
that?"
240,MAN IN BLACK,240,"Oh no. It's just that they're
terribly comfortable. I think
everyone will be wearing them in
the future."
241,FEZZIK,241,"I just figured out why you give
me so much trouble."
242,MAN IN BLACK,242,"Why is that, do you think?"
243,FEZZIK,243,"Well, I haven't fought just one
person for so long. I've been
specializing in groups. Battling
gangs for local charities, that
kind of thing."
244,MAN IN BLACK,244,"Why should that make such a
difference?"
245,FEZZIK,245,Well ...
246,FEZZIK,246,"... you see, you use different
moves when you're fighting half a
dozen people than when you only
have to be worried about one."
247,MAN IN BLACK,247,"I don't envy you the headache you
will have when you awake. But, in
the meantime, rest well ... and
dream of large women."
248,HUMPERDINCK,248,"There was a mighty duel -- it
ranged all over. They were both
masters."
249,RUGEN,249,Who won? How did it end?
250,HUMPERDINCK,250,The loser ran off alone.
251,HUMPERDINCK,251,"The winner followed those
footprints toward Guilder!"
252,RUGEN,252,Shall we track them both?
253,HUMPERDINCK,253,"The loser is nothing. -- Only the
Princess matters --"
254,HUMPERDINCK,254,"-- clearly this was all planned
by warriors of Guilder. We must
be ready for whatever lies ahead."
255,RUGEN,255,Could this be a trap?
256,HUMPERDINCK,256,"I always think everything could
be a trap -- Which is why I'm
still alive."
257,VIZZINI,257,"So, it is down to you. And it is
down to me."
258,VIZZINI,258,"If you wish her dead, by all
means keep moving forward."
259,MAN IN BLACK,259,Let me explain-
260,VIZZINI,260,"-- there's nothing to explain.
You're trying to kidnap what I've
rightfully stolen."
261,MAN IN BLACK,261,"Perhaps an arrangement can be
reached."
262,VIZZINI,262,There will be no arrangement --
263,VIZZINI,263,-- and you're killing her!
264,MAN IN BLACK,264,"But if there can be no
arrangement, then we are at an
impasse."
265,VIZZINI,265,"I'm afraid so -- I can't compete
with you physically. And you're
no match for my brains."
266,MAN IN BLACK,266,You're that smart?
267,VIZZINI,267,"Let me put it this way: have you
ever heard of Plato, Aristotle,
Socrates?"
268,MAN IN BLACK,268,Yes.
269,VIZZINI,269,Morons.
270,MAN IN BLACK,270,"Really? In that case, I challenge
you to a battle of wits."
271,VIZZINI,271,For the Princess?
272,VIZZINI,272,To the death?
273,VIZZINI,273,I accept.
274,MAN IN BLACK,274,Good. Then pour the wine.
275,MAN IN BLACK,275,"Inhale this, but do not touch."
276,VIZZINI,276,I smell nothing.
277,MAN IN BLACK,277,"What you do not smell is called
iocane powder. It is odorless,
tasteless, dissolves instantly in
liquid, and is among the more
deadlier poisons known to man."
278,VIZZINI,278,Hmm.
279,MAN IN BLACK,279,"All right: where is the poison?
The battle of wits has begun. It
ends when you decide and we both
drink, and find out who is right
and who is dead."
280,VIZZINI,280,"But it's so simple. All I have to
do is divine from what I know of
you. Are you the sort of man who
would put the poison into his own
goblet, or his enemy's?"
281,VIZZINI,281,"Now, a clever man would put the
poison into his own goblet,
because he would know that only a
great fool would reach for what
he was given. I'm not a great
fool, so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you. But you
must have known I was not a great
fool; you would have counted on
it, so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me."
282,MAN IN BLACK,282,You've made your decision then7
283,VIZZINI,283,"Not remotely. Because iocane
comes from Australia, as everyone
knows. And Australia is entirely
peopled with criminals. And
criminals are used to having
people not trust them, as you are
not trusted by me. So I can
clearly not choose the wine in
front of you."
284,MAN IN BLACK,284,"Truly, you have a dizzying
intellect."
285,VIZZINI,285,Wait till I get going! Where was I?
286,MAN IN BLACK,286,Australia.
287,VIZZINI,287,"Yes -- Australia, and you must
have suspected I would have known
the powder's origin, so I can
clearly not choose the wine in
front of me."
288,MAN IN BLACK,288,You're just stalling now.
289,VIZZINI,289,"You'd like to think that, wouldn't
you?"
290,VIZZINI,290,"You've beaten my giant, which
means you're exceptionally strong.
So, you could have put the poison
in your own goblet, trusting on
your strength to save you. So I
can clearly not choose the wine
in front of you. But, you've also
bested my Spaniard which means
you must have studied. And in
studying, you must have learned
that man is mortal so you would
have put the poison as far from
yourself as possible, so I can
clearly not choose the wine in
front of me."
291,MAN IN BLACK,291,"You're trying to trick me into
giving away something -- it won't
work --"
292,VIZZINI,292,"It has worked -- you've given
everything away -- I know where
the poison is."
293,MAN IN BLACK,293,Then make your choice.
294,VIZZINI,294,I will. And I choose --
295,VIZZINI,295,-- what in the world can that be?
296,MAN IN BLACK,296,What? Where? I don't see anything.
297,VIZZINI,297,"Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I
saw something. No matter."
298,MAN IN BLACK,298,What's so funny?
299,VIZZINI,299,"I'll tell you in a minute. First,
let's drink -- me from my glass,
and you from yours."
300,MAN IN BLACK,300,You guessed wrong.
301,VIZZINI,301,You only think I guessed wrong --
302,VIZZINI,302,"-- that's what's so funny! I
switched glasses when your back
was turned. You fool."
303,VIZZINI,303,"You fell victim to one of the
classic blunders. The most famous
is ""Never get involved in a land
war in Asia."" But only slightly
less well known is this: ""Never
go in against a Sicilian when
death is on the line."""
304,BUTTERCUP,304,Who are you?
305,MAN IN BLACK,305,"I am no one to be trifled with,
that is all you ever need know."
306,BUTTERCUP,306,"To think -- all that time it was
your cup that was poisoned."
307,MAN IN BLACK,307,"They were both poisoned. I spent
the last few years building up an
immunity to iocane powder."
308,HUMPERDINCK,308,Someone has beaten a giant!
309,HUMPERDINCK,309,"There will be great suffering in
Guilder if she dies."
310,MAN IN BLACK,310,Catch your breath.
311,BUTTERCUP,311,"If you'll release me ... whatever
you ask for ransom ... you'll get
it, I promise you..."
312,MAN IN BLACK,312,"And what is that worth, the
promise of a woman? You're very
funny, Highness."
313,BUTTERCUP,313,"I was giving you a chance. No
matter where you take me ...
there's no greater hunter than
Prince Humperdinck. He could
track a falcon on a cloudy day.
He can find you"
314,MAN IN BLACK,314,"You think your dearest love will
save you?"
315,BUTTERCUP,315,"I never said he was my dearest
love. And yes, he will save me.
That I know."
316,MAN IN BLACK,316,"You admit to me you do not love
your fiance?"
317,BUTTERCUP,317,He knows I do not love him.
318,MAN IN BLACK,318,"""Are not capable of love"" is what
you mean."
319,BUTTERCUP,319,"I have loved more deeply than a
killer like yourself could ever
dream."
320,MAN IN BLACK,320,"That was a warning, Highness. The
next time, my hand flies on its
own. For where I come from, there
are penalties when a woman lies."
321,HUMPERDINCK,321,Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
322,HUMPERDINCK,322,"And there are the Princess's
footprints. She is alive ... or
was, an hour ago. If she is
otherwise when I find her, I
shall be very put out."
323,MAN IN BLACK,323,"Rest, Highness."
324,BUTTERCUP,324,"I know who you are -- your
cruelty reveals everything."
325,BUTTERCUP,325,"You're the Dread Pirate Roberts;
admit it."
326,MAN IN BLACK,326,With pride. What can I do for you?
327,BUTTERCUP,327,"You can die slowly cut into a
thousand pieces."
328,MAN IN BLACK,328,"Hardly complimentary, Your
Highness. Why loose your venom on
me?"
329,BUTTERCUP,329,You killed my love.
330,MAN IN BLACK,330,"It's possible; I kill a lot of
people. Who was this love of
yours? Another Prince, like this
one, ugly, rich, and scabby?"
331,BUTTERCUP,331,"No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and
perfect, with eyes like the sea
after a storm."
332,BUTTERCUP,332,"On the high seas, your ship
attacked, and the Dread Pirate
Roberts never takes prisoners."
333,MAN IN BLACK,333,"I can't afford to make exceptions.
Once word leaks out that a pirate
has gone soft, people begin to
disobey you, and then it's
nothing but work, work, work, all
the time."
334,BUTTERCUP,334,You mock my pain!
335,MAN IN BLACK,335,"Life is pain, Highness. Anyone
who says differently is selling
something. I remember this farm
boy of yours, I think. This would
be, what, five years ago?"
336,MAN IN BLACK,336,Does it bother you to hear?
337,BUTTERCUP,337,Nothing you can say will upset me.
338,MAN IN BLACK,338,"He died well, that should please
you. No bribe attempts or
blubbering. He simply said,
""Please. Please, I need to live.""
It was the ""please"" that caught
my memory."
339,MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D),339,"I asked him what was so important
for him. ""True love,"" he replied.
And then he spoke of a girl of
surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
I can only assume he meant you.
You should bless me for destroying
him before he found out what you
really are."
340,BUTTERCUP,340,And what am I?
341,MAN IN BLACK,341,"Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
Your enduring faithfulness. Now,
tell me truly. When you found out
he was gone, did you get engaged
to your prince that same hour, or
did you wait a whole week out of
respect for the dead?"
342,BUTTERCUP,342,"You mocked me once, never do it
again -- I died that day!"
343,BUTTERCUP,343,"You can die too, for all I care!!"
344,MAN IN BLACK,344,... as ... you ... wish...
345,BUTTERCUP,345,"Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
done?"
346,HUMPERDINCK,346,"Disappeared. He must have seen us
closing in, which might account
for his panicking in error.
Unless I'm wrong, and I am never
wrong, they are headed dead into
the fire swamp."
347,WESTLEY,347,Can you move at all?
348,BUTTERCUP,348,"Move? You're alive. If you want,
I can fly."
349,WESTLEY,349,"I told you, ""I would always come
for you."" Why didn't you wait for
me?"
350,BUTTERCUP,350,Well ... you were dead.
351,WESTLEY,351,"Death cannot stop true love. All
it can do is delay it for a while."
352,BUTTERCUP,352,I will never doubt again.
353,WESTLEY,353,There will never be a need.
354,THE KID,354,"Oh no. No, please."
355,GRANDFATHER,355,What is it? What's the matter?
356,THE KID,356,"They're kissing again, do we have
to hear the kissing part?"
357,GRANDFATHER,357,"Someday, you may not mind so much."
358,THE KID,358,"Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that
sounded good."
359,GRANDFATHER,359,"Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you."
360,GRANDFATHER,360,"So now, where were we here? Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley
and Buttercup raced along the
ravine floor."
361,"WESTLEY
WESTLEY",361,"Ha. Your pig fiance is too late.
A few more steps and we'll be
safe in the Fire Swamp."
362,BUTTERCUP,362,We'll never survive.
363,WESTLEY,363,"Nonsense -- you're only saying
that because no one ever has."
364,WESTLEY,364,"It's not that bad. I'm not saying
I'd like to build a summer home
here, but the trees are actually
quite lovely."
365,WESTLEY,365,"Well now, that was an adventure."
366,WESTLEY,366,"Singed a bit, were you?"
367,BUTTERCUP,367,You?
368,WESTLEY,368,"Well, one thing I will say. The
Fire Swamp certainly does keep
you on your toes."
369,WESTLEY,369,"This will all soon be but a happy
memory because Roberts' ship
""Revenge"" is anchored at the far
end. And I, as you know, am
Roberts."
370,BUTTERCUP,370,"But how is that possible, since
he's been marauding twenty years
and you only left me five years
ago?"
371,WESTLEY,371,"I myself am often surprised at
life's little quirks."
372,WESTLEY,372,"You see, what I told you before
about saying ""please"" was true.
It intrigued Roberts, as did my
descriptions of your beauty."
373,WESTLEY,373,"Finally, Roberts decided something.
He said, ""All right, Westley,
I've never had a valet. You can
try it for tonight. I'll most
likely kill you in the morning.""
Three years he said that. ""Good
night, Westley. Good work. Sleep
well. I'll most likely kill you
in the morning."" It was a fine
time for me. I was learning to
fence, to fight, anything anyone
would teach me. And Roberts and I
eventually became friends. And
then it happened."
374,BUTTERCUP,374,What? -- go on --
375,WESTLEY,375,"Well, Roberts had grown so rich,
he wanted to retire. So he took
me to his cabin and told me his
secret. ""I am not the Dread
Pirate Roberts,"" he said. ""My
name is Ryan. I inherited this
ship from the previous Dread
Pirate Roberts, just as you will
inherit it from me. The man I
inherited it from was not the
real Dread Pirate Roberts, either."
376,WESTLEY (CONT'D),376,"His name was Cummerbund. The real
Roberts has been retired fifteen
years and living like a king in
Patagonia."" Then he explained the
name was the important thing for
inspiring the necessary fear. You
see, no one would surrender to
the Dread Pirate Westley."
377,WESTLEY,377,"So we sailed ashore, took on an
entirely new crew and he stayed
aboard for awhile as first mate,
all the time calling me Roberts.
Once the crew believed, he left
the ship and I have been Roberts
ever since. Except, now that
we're together, I shall retire
and hand the name over to someone
else. Is everything clear to you?"
378,BUTTERCUP,378,"We'll never succeed -- we may as
well die here."
379,WESTLEY,379,No. No. We have already succeeded.
380,WESTLEY,380,"I mean, what are the three
terrors of the Fire Swamp? One,
the flame spurts. No problem.
There's a popping sound preceding
each, we can avoid that. Two, the
Lightning Sand. But you were
clever enough to discover what
that looks like, so in the future
we can avoid that too."
381,BUTTERCUP,381,"Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?"
382,WESTLEY,382,"Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't
think they exist..."
383,BUTTERCUP,383,Westley!
384,BUTTERCUP,384,We did it.
385,WESTLEY,385,"Now, was that so terrible?"
386,HUMPERDINCK,386,Surrender!
387,WESTLEY,387,"You mean you wish to surrender to
me? Very well, I accept."
388,HUMPERDINCK,388,"I give you full marks for
bravery --don't make yourself a
fool."
389,WESTLEY,389,"Ah, but how will you capture us?
We know the secrets of the Fire
Swamp. We can live there quite
happily for some time. So,
whenever you feel like dying,
feel free to visit."
390,HUMPERDINCK,390,I tell you once again -- surrender!
391,WESTLEY,391,It will not happen!
392,HUMPERDINCK,392,For the last time -- SURRENDER!
393,WESTLEY,393,DEATH FIRST!!
394,BUTTERCUP,394,Will you promise not to hurt him?
395,HUMPERDINCK,395,What was that?
396,WESTLEY,396,What was that?
397,BUTTERCUP,397,"If we surrender, and I return
with you, will you promise not to
hurt this man?"
398,HUMPERDINCK,398,"May I live a thousand years and
never hunt again."
399,BUTTERCUP,399,"He is a sailor on the pirate ship
""Revenge."" Promise to return him
to his ship."
400,HUMPERDINCK,400,I swear it will be done.
401,HUMPERDINCK,401,"Once we're out of sight, take him
back to Florin and throw him in
the Pit of Despair."
402,RUGEN,402,I swear it will be done.
403,BUTTERCUP,403,"I thought you were dead once, and
it almost destroyed me. I could
not bear it if you died again,
not when I could save you."
404,RUGEN,404,"Come, sir. We must get you to
your ship."
405,WESTLEY,405,"We are men of action. Lies do not
become us."
406,RUGEN,406,"Well spoken, sir --"
407,RUGEN,407,-- what is it?
408,WESTLEY,408,"You have six fingers on your
right hand -- someone was looking
for you --"
409,WESTLEY,409,Where am I?
410,ALBINO,410,The Pit of Despair.
411,ALBINO,411,Don't even think --
412,ALBINO,412,"-- don't even think about trying
to escape. The chains are far too
thick. And don't dream of being
rescued either. The only way in
is secret. And only the Prince,
the Count, and I know how to get
in and out."
413,WESTLEY,413,Then I'm here till I die?
414,ALBINO,414,Till they kill you. Yeah.
415,WESTLEY,415,Then why bother curing me?
416,ALBINO,416,"The Prince and the Count always
insist on everyone being healthy
before they're broken."
417,WESTLEY,417,So it's to be torture.
418,WESTLEY,418,I can cope with torture.
419,WESTLEY,419,You don't believe me?
420,ALBINO,420,"You survived the Fire Swamp. You
must be very brave..."
421,ALBINO,421,"... but nobody withstands The
Machine."
422,HUMPERDINCK,422,"She's been like that ever since
the Fire Swamp."
423,HUMPERDINCK,423,"It's my father's failing health
that's upsetting her."
424,RUGEN,424,Of course.
425,GRANDFATHER,425,"The King died that very night,
and before the following dawn,
Buttercup and Humperdinck were
married."
426,GRANDFATHER,426,"And at noon, she met her subjects
again. This time as their Queen."
427,HUMPERDINCK,427,My father's final words were...
428,THE KID,428,"-- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa."
429,THE KID,429,"You read that wrong. She doesn't
marry Humperdinck, she marries
Westley. I'm just sure of it.
After all that Westley did for
her, if she does not marry him,
it wouldn't be fair."
430,GRANDFATHER,430,"Well, who says life is fair?
Where is that written? Life isn't
always fair."
431,THE KID,431,"I'm telling you you're messing up
the story, now get it right!"
432,GRANDFATHER,432,Do you want me to go on with this?
433,THE KID,433,Yes.
434,GRANDFATHER,434,"All right, then. No more
interruptions."
435,GRANDFATHER,435,"... at noon, she met her subjects
again. This time as their Queen."
436,HUMPERDINCK,436,"My father's final words were
""love her as I loved her, and
there will be joy."" I present to
you your Queen. Queen Buttercup."
437,BUTTERCUP,437,Why do you do this?
438,ANCIENT BOOER,438,"Because you had love in your
hands, and you gave it up."
439,BUTTERCUP,439,"But they would have killed
Westley if I hadn't done it."
440,ANCIENT BOOER,440,"Your true love lives and you
marry another --"
441,ANCIENT BOOER,441,"-- True love saved her in the
Fire Swamp, and she treated it
like garbage. And that's what she
is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow
down to her if you want. Bow to
her. Bow to the Queen of Slime,
the Queen of Filth, the Queen of
Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish!
Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo!"
442,GRANDFATHER,442,"It was ten days till the wedding.
The King still lived, but
Buttercup's nightmares were
growing steadily worse."
443,THE KID,443,"See? Didn't I tell you she'd
never marry that rotten
Humperdinck?"
444,GRANDFATHER,444,"-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up."
445,BUTTERCUP,445,"It comes to this: I love Westley.
I always have. I know now I
always will. If you tell me I
must marry you in ten days,
please believe I will be dead by
morning."
446,HUMPERDINCK,446,"I could never cause you grief;
consider our wedding off."
447,HUMPERDINCK,447,"You returned this Westley to his
ship?"
448,RUGEN,448,Yes.
449,HUMPERDINCK,449,Then we will simply alert him.
450,HUMPERDINCK,450,"Beloved, are you certain he still
wants you? After all, it was you
who did the leaving in the Fire
Swamp. Not to mention that
pirates are not known to be men
of their words."
451,BUTTERCUP,451,My Westley will always come for me.
452,HUMPERDINCK,452,"I suggest a deal. You write four
copies of a letter. I'll send my
four fastest ships. One in each
direction. The Dread Pirate
Roberts is always close to Florin
this time of year. We'll run up
the white flag and deliver your
message. If Westley wants you,
bless you both. If not ... please
consider me as an alternative to
suicide. Are we agreed?"
453,RUGEN,453,"Your Princess is really a winning
creature. A trifle simple,
perhaps, but her appeal is
undeniable."
454,HUMPERDINCK,454,"Oh, I know. The people are quite
taken with her. It's odd, but
when I hired Vizzini to have her
murdered on our engagement day, I
thought that was clever. But it's
going to be so much more moving
when I strangle her on our
wedding night. Once Guilder is
blamed, the nation will be truly
outraged. They'll demand we go to
war."
455,RUGEN,455,"Now, where is that secret knot?
It's impossible to find."
456,RUGEN,456,"Are you coming down into the Pit?
Westley's got his strength back.
I am starting him on The Machine
tonight."
457,HUMPERDINCK,457,"Tyrone, you know how much I love
watching you work. But, I've got
my country's five hundredth
anniversary to plan, my wedding
to arrange, My wife to murder,
and Guilder to frame for it. I'm
swamped."
458,RUGEN,458,"Get some rest -- if you haven't
got your health, you haven't got
anything."
459,RUGEN,459,"Beautiful, isn't it?"
460,RUGEN,460,"It took me half a lifetime to
invent it. I'm sure you've
discovered my deep and abiding
interest in pain. At present I'm
writing the definitive work on
the subject. So I want you to be
totally honest with me on how The
Machine makes you feel."
461,RUGEN,461,"This being our first try, I'll
use the lowest setting."
462,RUGEN,462,"As you know, the concept of the
suction pump is centuries old.
Well, really, that's all this is.
Except that instead of sucking
water, I'm sucking life. I've
just sucked one year of your life
away. I might one day go as high
as five, but I really don't know
what that would do to you. So,
let's just start with what we
have. What did this do to you?
Tell me. And remember, this is
for posterity, so be honest --
how do you feel?"
463,RUGEN,463,Interesting.
464,HUMPERDINCK,464,Yellin.
465,YELLIN,465,Sire.
466,HUMPERDINCK,466,"As Chief Enforcer of all Florin,
I trust you with this secret:
killers from Guilder are
infiltrating the Thieves' Forest
and plan to murder my bride on
our wedding night."
467,YELLIN,467,"My spy network has heard no such
news."
468,BUTTERCUP,468,Any word from Westley?
469,HUMPERDINCK,469,"Too soon, my angel. Patience."
470,BUTTERCUP,470,He will come for me.
471,HUMPERDINCK,471,Of course.
472,HUMPERDINCK,472,"She will not be murdered. On the
day of the wedding, I want the
Thieves' Forest emptied and every
inhabitant arrested."
473,YELLIN,473,"Many of the thieves will resist.
My regular enforcers will be
inadequate."
474,HUMPERDINCK,474,"Form a Brute Squad then. I want
the Thieves' Forest emptied
before I wed."
475,YELLIN,475,"It won't be easy, Sire."
476,HUMPERDINCK,476,Try ruling the world sometime.
477,GRANDFATHER,477,"The day of the wedding arrived.
The Brute Squad had their hands
full carrying out Humperdinck's
orders."
478,YELLIN,478,Is everybody out?
479,ASSISTANT BRUTE,479,"Almost. There's a Spaniard giving
us some trouble."
480,YELLIN,480,"Well, you give him some trouble.
Move!"
481,INIGO,481,"I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
You told me to go back to the
beginning. So I have. This is
where I am, and this is where
I'll stay. I will not be moved."
482,ASSISTANT BRUTE,482,Ho there.
483,INIGO,483,"I do not budge. Keep your ""Ho
there."""
484,ASSISTANT BRUTE,484,But the Prince gave orders --
485,INIGO,485,"-- So did Vizzini -- when a job
went wrong, you went back to the
beginning. And this is where we
got the job. So it's the
beginning, and I'm staying till
Vizzini comes."
486,ASSISTANT BRUTE,486,You! Brute! Come here.
487,INIGO,487,"-- I -- am -- waiting -- for --
Vizzini --"
488,VOICE,488,You surely are a meanie.
489,FEZZIK,489,Hello.
490,INIGO,490,It's you.
491,FEZZIK,491,True!
492,FEZZIK,492,You don't look so good.
493,FEZZIK,493,You don't smell so good either.
494,INIGO,494,Perhaps not. I feel fine.
495,FEZZIK,495,Yeah?
496,GRANDFATHER,496,"FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited.
And as FEZZIK nursed his
inebriated friend back to health,
he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
and the existence of Count Rugen,
the sixfingered man. Considering
Inigo's lifelong search, he
handled the news surprisingly well."
497,GRANDFATHER,497,"Fezzik took great care in reviving
Inigo."
498,INIGO,498,"That's enough. That's enough!
Where is this Rugen so I may kill
him?"
499,FEZZIK,499,"He's with the Prince in the
Castle. But the castle gate is
guarded by thirty men."
500,INIGO,500,How many could you handle?
501,FEZZIK,501,I don't think more than ten.
502,INIGO,502,"That leaves twenty for me. At my
best, I could never defeat that
many."
503,INIGO,503,"I need Vizzini to plan. I have no
gift for strategy."
504,FEZZIK,504,But Vizzini's dead.
505,INIGO,505,"No -- not Vizzini -- I need the
Man in Black --"
506,FEZZIK,506,-- what? --
507,INIGO,507,"-- look, he bested you with
strength, your greatness. He
bested me with steel. He must
have outthought Vizzini, and a
man who can do that can plan my
castle's onslaught any day. Let's
go --"
508,FEZZIK,508,-- where?
509,INIGO,509,"To find the Man in Black,
obviously."
510,FEZZIK,510,But you don't know where he is.
511,INIGO,511,"Don't bother me with trifles;
after twenty years, at last, my
father's soul will be at peace."
512,INIGO,512,There will be blood tonight!!
513,HUMPERDINCK,513,Rise and report.
514,YELLIN,514,"The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
Thirty men guard the castle gate."
515,HUMPERDINCK,515,"Double it. My Princess must be
safe."
516,YELLIN,516,"The gate has but one key, and I
carry that."
517,HUMPERDINCK,517,"Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we
marry. Tomorrow morning, your men
will escort us to Florin Channel
where every ship in my armada
waits to accompany us on our
honeymoon."
518,BUTTERCUP,518,"Every ship but your four fastest,
you mean."
519,BUTTERCUP,519,Every ship but the four you sent.
520,HUMPERDINCK,520,"Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally,
not those four."
521,YELLIN,521,Your Majesties.
522,BUTTERCUP,522,"You never sent the ships. Don't
bother lying. It doesn't matter.
Westley will come for me anyway."
523,HUMPERDINCK,523,You're a silly girl.
524,BUTTERCUP,524,"Yes, I am a silly girl, for not
having seen sooner that you were
nothing but a coward with a heart
full of fear."
525,HUMPERDINCK,525,"I-would-not-say-such things-if-
Iwere-you-"
526,BUTTERCUP,526,"Why not? You can't hurt me.
Westley and I are joined by the
bonds of love. And you cannot
track that. Not with a thousand
bloodhounds. And you cannot break
it. Not with a thousand swords.
And when I say you are a coward,
that is only because you are the
slimiest weakling ever to crawl
the earth."
527,HUMPERDINCK,527,IWOULDNOTSAYSUCHTHINGSIFIWEREYOU!
528,HUMPERDINCK,528,"You truly love each other, and so
you might have been truly happy.
Not one couple in a century has
that chance, no matter what the
storybooks say. And so I think no
man in a century will suffer as
greatly as you will."
529,RUGEN,529,Not to fifty!!!
530,FEZZIK,530,The Man in Black?
531,INIGO,531,"His true love is marrying another
tonight, so who else has cause
for Ultimate Suffering?"
532,INIGO,532,Excuse me --
533,INIGO,533,"-- pardon me, it's important --"
534,INIGO,534,"-- Fezzik, please --"
535,FEZZIK,535,Everybody ... MOVE!!
536,INIGO,536,Thank you.
537,INIGO,537,Where is the Man in Black?
538,INIGO,538,"You get there from this grove, yes?"
539,INIGO,539,"Fezzik, jog his memory."
540,FEZZIK,540,"I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean
to jog him so hard. Inigo?"
541,INIGO,541,"Father, I have failed you for
twenty years. Now our misery can
end. Somewhere ... somewhere
close by is a man who can help us.
I cannot find him alone. I need
you. I need you to guide my sword.
Please."
542,INIGO,542,Guide my sword.
543,FEZZIK,543,He's dead.
544,INIGO,544,It just is not fair.
545,THE KID,545,"-- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait --"
546,THE KID,546,"-- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean,
""He's dead?"" I mean he didn't
mean dead."
547,THE KID,547,"Westley's only faking, right?"
548,GRANDFATHER,548,You want me to read this or not?
549,THE KID,549,Who gets Humperdinck?
550,GRANDFATHER,550,I don't understand.
551,THE KID,551,"Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At
the end, somebody's got to do it.
Is it Inigo? Who?"
552,GRANDFATHER,552,Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
553,THE KID,553,"You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa!
What did you read me this thing
for?"
554,GRANDFATHER,554,"You know, you've been very sick
and you're taking this story very
seriously. I think we better stop
now."
555,THE KID,555,No! I'm okay. I'm okay.
556,THE KID,556,-- sit down. All right?
557,GRANDFATHER,557,Okay.
558,GRANDFATHER,558,"All right, now, let's see. Where
were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
Despair."
559,INIGO,559,"Well, we Montoyas have never
taken defeat easily. Come along,
Fezzik. Bring the body."
560,FEZZIK,560,The body?
561,INIGO,561,Have you any money?
562,FEZZIK,562,I have a little.
563,INIGO,563,"I just hope it's enough to buy a
miracle, that's all."
564,LITTLE OLD GUY,564,Go away!
565,MIRACLE MAX,565,What? What?
566,INIGO,566,"Are you the Miracle Max who
worked for the King all those
years?"
567,MIRACLE MAX,567,"The King's stinking son fired me.
And thank you so much for bringing
up such a painful subject. While
you're at it, why don't you give
me a nice paper cut and pour
lemon juice on it? We're closed!"
568,MIRACLE MAX,568,"Beat it or I'll call the Brute
Squad."
569,FEZZIK,569,I'm on the Brute Squad.
570,MIRACLE MAX,570,You are the Brute Squad.
571,INIGO,571,"We need a miracle. It's very
important."
572,MIRACLE MAX,572,"Look, I'm retired. And besides,
why would you want someone the
King's stinking son fired? I
might kill whoever you wanted me
to miracle."
573,INIGO,573,He's already dead.
574,MIRACLE MAX,574,"He is, eh? I'll take a look.
Bring him in."
575,MIRACLE MAX,575,I've seen worse.
576,INIGO,576,Sir. Sir.
577,MIRACLE MAX,577,Hah?
578,INIGO,578,We're really in a terrible rush.
579,MIRACLE MAX,579,"Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a
miracle man, you get rotten
miracles. You got money?"
580,INIGO,580,Sixty-five.
581,MIRACLE MAX,581,"Sheesh! I never worked for so
little, except once, and that was
a very noble cause."
582,INIGO,582,"This is noble, sir."
583,INIGO,583,"His wife is crippled. His children
are on the brink of starvation."
584,MIRACLE MAX,584,Are you a rotten liar.
585,INIGO,585,"I need him to help avenge my
father, murdered these twenty
years."
586,MIRACLE MAX,586,Your first story was better.
587,MIRACLE MAX,587,Where's that bellows?
588,MIRACLE MAX,588,"He probably owes you money, huh?
Well, I'll ask him."
589,INIGO,589,He's dead. He can't talk.
590,MIRACLE MAX,590,"Look who knows so much. Well, it
just so happens that your friend
here is only mostly dead. There's
a big difference between mostly
dead and all dead. Please open
his mouth."
591,MIRACLE MAX,591,"Now, mostly dead is slightly
alive. Now, all dead...well, with
all dead, there's usually only
one thing that you can do."
592,INIGO,592,What's that?
593,MIRACLE MAX,593,"Go through his clothes and look
for loose change."
594,MIRACLE MAX,594,"Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's
so important? What you got here
that's worth living for?"
595,WESTLEY,595,... tr ... oooo .... luv...
596,INIGO,596,"True love. You heard him. You
could not ask for a more noble
cause than that."
597,MIRACLE MAX,597,"Sonny, true love is the greatest
thing in the world. Except for a
nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and
tomato sandwich, where the mutton
is nice and lean and the tomato
is ripe. They're so perky, I love
that. But that's not what he said.
He distinctly said ""to blave.""
And, as we all know, ""to blave""
means ""to bluff."" So you're
probably playing cards, and he
cheated"
598,A WOMAN'S VOICE,598,-- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR --
599,MIRACLE MAX,599,"-- get back, witch --"
600,VALERIE,600,"I'm not a witch, I'm your wife.
But after what you just said, I'm
not even sure I want to be that
anymore."
601,MIRACLE MAX,601,You never had it so good.
602,VALERIE,602,"""True love."" He said, ""true
love,"" Max. My God --"
603,MIRACLE MAX,603,"Don't say another word, Valerie."
604,VALERIE,604,"He's afraid. Ever since Prince
Humperdinck fired him, his
confidence is shattered."
605,MIRACLE MAX,605,"Why'd you say that name -- you
promised me that you would never
say that name --"
606,VALERIE,606,"What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck.
Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck"
607,MIRACLE MAX,607,I'm not listening.
608,VALERIE,608,"A life expiring and you don't
have the decency to say why you
won't help --"
609,MIRACLE MAX,609,Nobody's hearing nothing!
610,VALERIE,610,"Humperdinck. Humperdinck!
Humperdinck!"
611,INIGO,611,"-- But this is Buttercup's true
love -- If you heal him, he will
stop Humperdinck's wedding."
612,VALERIE,612,Humperdinck. Humperdinck --
613,MIRACLE MAX,613,Shut up --
614,MIRACLE MAX,614,"Wait. Wait. I make him better,
Humperdinck suffers?"
615,INIGO,615,Humiliations galore!
616,MIRACLE MAX,616,"That is a noble cause. Give me
the sixty-five, I'm on the job."
617,INIGO,617,That's a miracle pill?
618,VALERIE,618,"The chocolate coating makes it go
down easier. But you have to wait
fifteen minutes for full potency.
And you shouldn't go swimming
after, for at least, what?"
619,MIRACLE MAX,619,An hour.
620,VALERIE,620,"Yeah, an hour."
621,MIRACLE MAX,621,A good hour. Yeah.
622,INIGO,622,Thank you for everything.
623,MIRACLE MAX,623,Okay.
624,VALERIE,624,"Bye-bye, boys."
625,MIRACLE MAX,625,Have fun storming the castle.
626,VALERIE,626,Think it'll work?
627,MIRACLE MAX,627,It would take a miracle. Bye!
628,VALERIE,628,Bye.
629,FEZZIK,629,"Inigo -- there's more than
thirty --"
630,INIGO,630,What's the difference?
631,INIGO,631,"We've got him. Help me here.
We'll have to force feed him."
632,FEZZIK,632,Has it been fifteen minutes?
633,INIGO,633,"We can't wait -- the wedding's in
half an hour and we must strike
in the hustle and the bustle
beforehand."
634,INIGO,634,Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
635,FEZZIK,635,"How long do we have to wait
before we know if the miracle
works?"
636,INIGO,636,Your guess is as good as mine --
637,WESTLEY,637,"I'll beat you both apart. I'll
take you both together."
638,FEZZIK,638,Guess not very long.
639,WESTLEY,639,Why won't my arms move?
640,FEZZIK,640,You've been mostly dead all day.
641,INIGO,641,"We had Miracle Max make a pill to
bring you back."
642,WESTLEY,642,"Who are you? -- Are we enemies?
Why am I on this wall? -- Where's
Buttercup? --"
643,INIGO,643,Let me explain --
644,INIGO,644,"-- No, there is too much. Let me
sum up."
645,INIGO (CONT'D),645,"Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
in a little less than half an
hour, so all we have to do is get
in, break up the wedding, steal
the Princess, make our escape
after I kill Count Rugen."
646,WESTLEY,646,"That doesn't leave much time for
dilly dallying."
647,FEZZIK,647,"You've just wiggled your finger.
That's wonderful."
648,WESTLEY,648,I've always been a quick healer.
649,WESTLEY,649,What are our liabilities?
650,INIGO,650,"There is but one working castle
gate."
651,INIGO,651,And it is guarded by sixty men.
652,WESTLEY,652,And our assets?
653,INIGO,653,"Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
my steel."
654,WESTLEY,654,"That's it? Impossible. If I had a
month to plan, maybe I could come
up with something. But this..."
655,FEZZIK,655,"You just shook your head -- that
doesn't make you happy?"
656,WESTLEY,656,"My brains, his steel, and your
strength against sixty men, and
you think a little head jiggle is
supposed to make me happy? I
mean, if we only had a
wheelbarrow, that would be
something."
657,INIGO,657,"Where did we put that wheelbarrow
the Albino had?"
658,FEZZIK,658,"Over the Albino, I think."
659,WESTLEY,659,"Well, why didn't you list that
among our assets in the first
place? What I wouldn't give for a
holocaust cloak."
660,INIGO,660,There we cannot help you.
661,FEZZIK,661,Will this do?
662,INIGO,662,Where did you get that?
663,FEZZIK,663,"At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice,
he said I could keep it."
664,WESTLEY,664,"All right, all right. Come on,
help me up."
665,WESTLEY,665,"Now, I'll need a sword eventually."
666,INIGO,666,Why? You can't even lift one.
667,WESTLEY,667,"True, but that's hardly common
knowledge, is it?"
668,WESTLEY,668,"Thank you. Now, there may be
problems once we're inside."
669,INIGO,669,"I'll say -- how do I find the
Count? -- Once I do, how do I
find you again? -- Once I find
you again, how do we escape? --"
670,FEZZIK,670,"Don't pester him, he's had a hard
day."
671,INIGO,671,"Right, right, sorry."
672,FEZZIK,672,Inigo.
673,INIGO,673,What?
674,FEZZIK,674,I hope we win...
675,HUMPERDINCK,675,"You don't seem excited, my little
muffin."
676,BUTTERCUP,676,Should I be?
677,HUMPERDINCK,677,"Brides often are, I'm told."
678,BUTTERCUP,678,I do not marry tonight.
679,BUTTERCUP,679,My Westley will save me.
680,IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN,680,"Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings
us togewer today..."
681,IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN,681,"Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement,
that dweam wiffim a dweam..."
682,YELLIN,682,"Stand your ground, men. Stand
your ground."
683,YELLIN,683,Stand your ground.
684,FEZZIK,684,"I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS.
THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS."
685,INIGO,685,Now?
686,WESTLEY,686,Not yet.
687,FEZZIK,687,"MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE,
BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE"
688,INIGO,688,Now?
689,WESTLEY,689,Light him.
690,FEZZIK,690,"THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS TAKES NO
SURVIVORS. ALL YOUR WORST
NIGHTMARES ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE."
691,IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN,691,"... Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow
you fowever.."
692,FEZZIK,692,"THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE
FOR YOUR SOULS!"
693,YELLIN,693,"Stay where you are. I said stay
where you are!"
694,IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN,694,... so tweasuwe your vruv..
695,HUMPERDINCK,695,Skip to the end.
696,IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN,696,Have you the wing?
697,BUTTERCUP,697,Here comes my Westley now.
698,WESTLEY,698,"FEZZIK, the portcullis."
699,HUMPERDINCK,699,Your Westley is dead.
700,HUMPERDINCK,700,I killed him myself.
701,BUTTERCUP,701,"Then why is there fear behind
your eyes?"
702,WESTLEY,702,Give us the gate key.
703,YELLIN,703,I have no gate key.
704,INIGO,704,"Fezzik, tear his arms off."
705,YELLIN,705,"Oh, you mean this gate key."
706,IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN,706,"And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup..."
707,HUMPERDINCK,707,Man and wife -- say man and wife...
708,IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN,708,Man and wife.
709,HUMPERDINCK,709,"Escort the bride to the Honeymoon
Suite -- I'll be there shortly."
710,BUTTERCUP,710,He didn't come.
711,RUGEN,711,"Kill the dark one and the giant,
but leave the third for
questioning."
712,INIGO,712,"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father. Prepare to
die."
713,INIGO,713,"Fezzik, I need you --"
714,FEZZIK,714,I can't leave him alone.
715,INIGO,715,"He's getting away from me, Fezzik.
Please. FEZZIK!"
716,FEZZIK,716,I'll be right back.
717,INIGO,717,Thank you --
718,KING,718,Strange wedding.
719,QUEEN,719,"Yes. A very strange wedding. Come
along."
720,KING,720,What was that for?
721,BUTTERCUP,721,"Because you've always been so
kind to me. And I won't be seeing
you again since I'm killing
myself once we reach the Honeymoon
Suite."
722,KING,722,Won't that be nice?
723,KING,723,She kissed me...
724,INIGO,724,"... Sorry, Father ... I tried ...
I tried..."
725,RUGEN,725,"You must be that little Spanish
brat I taught a lesson to all
those years ago. It's simply
incredible. Have you been chasing
me your whole life only to fail
now? I think that's the worst
thing I ever heard. How marvelous."
726,WESTLEY,726,"There's a shortage of perfect
breasts in this world. It would
be a pity to damage yours."
727,BUTTERCUP,727,"Oh, Westley, darling."
728,BUTTERCUP,728,"Westley, why won't you hold me?"
729,WESTLEY,729,Gently.
730,BUTTERCUP,730,"At a time like this that's all
you can think to say? ""Gently?"""
731,WESTLEY,731,Gently!!
732,RUGEN,732,"Good heavens. Are you still
trying to win?"
733,RUGEN,733,"You've got an overdeveloped sense
of vengeance. It's going to get
you into trouble some day."
734,INIGO,734,"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
you killed my father; prepare to
die."
735,INIGO,735,"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
you killed my father, prepare to
die."
736,INIGO,736,"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father. Prepare to
die."
737,RUGEN,737,Stop saying that!
738,INIGO,738,"HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA.
YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO
DIE."
739,RUGEN,739,No --
740,INIGO,740,-- offer me money --
741,RUGEN,741,-- yes --
742,INIGO,742,-- power too -- promise me that --
743,RUGEN,743,"-- all that I have and more
please --"
744,INIGO,744,"-- offer me everything I ask
for --"
745,RUGEN,745,-- anything you want --
746,INIGO,746,"I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON-
OFA-BITCH!"
747,BUTTERCUP,747,"Oh, Westley, will you ever
forgive me?"
748,WESTLEY,748,"What hideous sin have you
committed lately?"
749,BUTTERCUP,749,"I got married. I didn't want to.
It all happened so fast."
750,WESTLEY,750,It never happened.
751,BUTTERCUP,751,What?
752,WESTLEY,752,It never happened.
753,BUTTERCUP,753,"But it did. I was there. This old
man said, ""Man and wife."""
754,WESTLEY,754,"Did you say, ""I do""?"
755,BUTTERCUP,755,"Well, no, we sort of skipped that
part."
756,WESTLEY,756,"Then you're not married -- if you
didn't say it, you didn't do it"
757,WESTLEY,757,"-- wouldn't you agree, Your
Highness?"
758,HUMPERDINCK,758,"A technicality that will shortly
be remedied. But first things
first. To the death."
759,WESTLEY,759,No.
760,WESTLEY,760,To the pain.
761,HUMPERDINCK,761,"I don't think I'm quite familiar
with that phrase."
762,WESTLEY,762,"I'll explain. And I'll use small
words so that you'll be sure to
understand, you wart-hog-faced
buffoon."
763,HUMPERDINCK,763,"That may be the first time in my
life a man has dared insult me."
764,WESTLEY,764,"It won't be the last. To the pain
means the first thing you lose
will be your feet, below the
ankles, then your hands at the
wrists, next your nose."
765,HUMPERDINCK,765,"-- and then my tongue, I suppose.
I killed you too quickly the last
time, a mistake I don't mean to
duplicate tonight."
766,WESTLEY,766,"I wasn't finished -- the next
thing you lose will be your left
eye, followed by your right --"
767,HUMPERDINCK,767,"-- and then my ears, I understand.
Let's get on with it"
768,WESTLEY,768,"Wrong! Your ears you keep, and
I'll tell you why --"
769,WESTLEY,769,"-- so that every shriek of every
child at seeing your hideousness
will be yours to cherish -- every
babe that weeps at your approach,
every woman who cries out, ""Dear
God, what is that thing?"" will
echo in your perfect ears."
770,WESTLEY (CONT'D),770,"That is what ""to the pain"" means.
It means I leave you in anguish,
wallowing in freakish misery
forever."
771,HUMPERDINCK,771,I think you're bluffing --
772,WESTLEY,772,"It's possible, pig -- I might be
bluffing -- it's conceivable, you
miserable vomitous mass, that I'm
only lying here because I lack
the strength to stand -- then
again, perhaps I have the strength
after all."
773,WESTLEY,773,DROP-YOUR-SWORD.
774,WESTLEY,774,Have a seat.
775,WESTLEY,775,"Tie him up. Make it as tight as
you like."
776,INIGO,776,Where's Fezzik?
777,WESTLEY,777,I thought he was with you.
778,INIGO,778,No.
779,WESTLEY,779,In that case --
780,INIGO,780,Help him.
781,BUTTERCUP,781,Why does Westley need helping?
782,INIGO,782,Because he has no strength --
783,HUMPERDINCK,783,"I knew it! I knew you were
bluffing! I knew he was bluffing."
784,INIGO,784,Shall I dispatch him for you?
785,WESTLEY,785,"Thank you, but no -- whatever
happens to us, I want him to live
a long life alone with his
cowardice."
786,FEZZIK,786,"Inigo! Inigo, where are you?"
787,FEZZIK,787,"Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw
the Prince's stables, and there
they were, four white horses. And
I thought, there are four of us,
if we ever find the lad -- hello,
lad -- so I took them with me, in
case we ever bumped into each
other."
788,FEZZIK,788,I guess we just did.
789,INIGO,789,"FEZZIK, you did something right."
790,FEZZIK,790,"Don't worry -- I won't let it go
to my head."
791,INIGO,791,"You know, it's very strange -- I
have been in the revenge business
so long, now that it's over, I
don't know what to do with the
rest of my life."
792,WESTLEY,792,"Have you ever considered piracy?
You'd make a wonderful Dread
Pirate Roberts."
793,GRANDFATHER,793,"They rode to freedom. And as dawn
arose, Westley and Buttercup knew
they were safe. A wave of love
swept over them. And as they
reached for each other..."
794,THE KID,794,What? What?
795,GRANDFATHER,795,"No, it's kissing again. You don't
want to hear it."
796,THE KID,796,I don't mind so much.
797,GRANDFATHER,797,Okay.
798,GRANDFATHER,798,"Since the invention of the kiss,
there have been five kisses that
were rated the most passionate,
the most pure. This one left them
all behind. The end."
799,GRANDFATHER,799,"Now I think you ought to go to
sleep."
800,THE KID,800,Okay.
801,GRANDFATHER,801,"Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
long."
802,THE KID,802,Grandpa?
803,THE KID,803,"Maybe you could come over and
read it again to me tomorrow."
804,GRANDFATHER,804,As you wish...
