209,MARTIN,209,"Come on, man. I'm getting it from all
angles here. I don't like it anymore."
210,JONAH,210,"I know, I don't either. Was it weird

it's herpes."
248,JASON,248,It's not herpes if it's everywhere.

340,ALISON,340,"I'm gonna give you my card because
that'll be the best way..."
341,BEN,341,"If you want to contact me, I don't
have a cell right now because of
payment complications, but you can
email me at the web page, I check it.
It's Ben at flesh of the stars, one
word, dot com."
342,BEN (CONT'D),342,"So, awesome."
343,ALISON,343,All right then. Nice to meet you.
344,ALISON (CONT'D),344,Take care.
345,BEN,345,"Okay, uh, see ya."
346,BEN (CONT'D),346,Bye!
347,(TO HIMSELF),347,"That was fuckin' brutal. Yeah, that
was brutal."
348,ALISON,348,"Hi, I'm Alison Scott and we're here
today with James Franco from ""Spider
Man."""
349,ALISON (CONT'D),349,How are you?
350,JAMES FRANCO,350,"Great.
KNOCKED UP - 29."
351,ALISON,351,Thanks for coming.
352,JAMES FRANCO,352,Of course.
353,ALISON,353,"Tell me, were you a big fan..."
354,ALISON (CONT'D),354,"...I'm sorry, let me take that again."
355,JAMES FRANCO,355,Okay.
356,ALISON,356,"Tell me, were you a big fan of the
comic books growing up?"
357,JAMES FRANCO,357,"No, actually, I didn't read any of the
comic books until I got the movie."
358,JAMES FRANCO,358,"JAMES FRANCO (cont'd)
Are you okay?"
359,ALISON,359,"Uh-huh. Yeah, just, what about the
comic books? Keep talking."
360,JAMES FRANCO,360,"Like I said I really wasn't into them,
but now that I did the research, I
think they're pretty amazing."
361,JAMES FRANCO,361,"JAMES FRANCO (cont'd)
What the fuck?"
362,BRENT,362,"Is that the sound of you puking?
JAMES FRANCO (ON TV MONITOR)
If this is one of those fuckin' joke
shows, I'm not into it."
363,BRENT,363,We should put this on YouTube.
364,ALISON,364,"Shut up.
KNOCKED UP - 30."
365,BRENT,365,This is hilarious.
366,ALISON,366,You're an asshole.
367,BRENT,367,"Look how sweaty you are. You look like
Dom DeLuise."
368,ALISON,368,"I don't need to see it again. It's
gonna make me throw up."
369,BRENT,369,You look like Jabba the Hutt dying.
370,ALISON,370,You're such an asshole.
371,BRENT,371,"I'm just jerking your chain. I'll fix
this. No problem."
372,ALISON,372,"Yeah, maybe if you can just edit this
out and we can re--"
373,ALISON (CONT'D),373,--we can reshoot my questions.
374,BRENT,374,What's up?
375,BRENT,375,"BRENT (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Over
here. Not on the mixing board, not on
the mixing board."
376,BRENT (CONT'D),376,Are you okay?
377,ALISON,377,Oh my god. Oh my god.
378,BRENT,378,Are you sick?
379,ALISON,379,I don't know.
380,BRENT,380,"What'd you eat?
KNOCKED UP - 31."
381,ALISON,381,I haven't eaten today yet.
382,BRENT,382,You haven't eaten yet?
383,ALISON,383,Do you have a napkin or something?
384,BRENT,384,"Here, here. What do you have, like the
flu?"
385,ALISON,385,I don't know.
386,BRENT,386,"God, I hope you're not pregnant."
387,ALISON,387,"It's impossible. You have to have sex
to get pregnant."
388,BRENT,388,"(into the phone)
B.K. It's Brent Master Five. Alison
just puked. Dude, that's what I said.
She's probably pregnant, right?"
389,ALISON,389,"Oh, shit."
390,BRENT,390,"(into the phone)
How does she look right now? She looks
like she just realized that she's
pregnant."
391,ALISON,391,"No, I can't be pregnant. Right? That
was what, eight weeks ago?"
392,DEBBIE,392,Did you miss your period?
393,ALISON,393,"No. Wait. I don't know. Shit. I don't
know. I can't remember. I was, I mean,
I've been really stressed at work. I
can't remember my last period."
394,DEBBIE,394,"Are you the lady who doesn't realize
she's pregnant until she's sitting on
the toilet and a kid pops out?
KNOCKED UP - 32."
395,ALISON,395,"Can you not joke right now? Don't joke
right now. This is really serious."
396,DEBBIE,396,Did I meet him?
397,ALISON,397,"Yeah. You know, he was kind of like
medium height, sort of...chubby.
Blonde, curly hair. Remember?"
398,DEBBIE,398,With the man boobs.
399,ALISON,399,"Yes! Here, I have this thing of him on
my phone."
400,ALISON,400,"BEN (ON PHONE VIDEO)
Hey! I live in your phone! This is the
best night of my life! I gotta pee."
401,DEBBIE,401,Oh god. How did this happen?
402,ALISON,402,"Oh, shit."
403,DEBBIE,403,Well there's only one way to find out.
404,DEBBIE,404,"They're here! Here they are! Over
here!"
405,ALISON,405,"Okay. ""Positive Choice."""
406,DEBBIE,406,"""Easy, One, Two, Three."""
407,ALISON,407,Here. Hurry up now. Come on.
408,ALISON,408,KNOCKED UP - 33.
409,ALISON (CONT'D),409,Get more! Get me a few more!
410,DEBBIE,410,"Did you try the ""Ova-Sure?"""
411,ALISON,411,"I'm dripping, I'm dripping. Wait."
412,DEBBIE,412,"Good! A smiley face! Oh, I think
that's bad."
413,ALISON,413,How long does this one take?
414,DEBBIE,414,"These can't all be positive. Let me
try one."
415,ALISON,415,"God, you really had to pee."
416,DEBBIE,416,What is this? What the hell is this?
417,ALISON,417,I think you picked up the wrong one.
418,DEBBIE,418,Fuck. That scared me. That would suck.
419,DEBBIE (CONT'D),419,I'm sorry. That scared me.
420,ALISON,420,It's gonna be fine. Right?
421,ALISON,421,"ALISON (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Right?"
422,DEBBIE,422,"Of course it will be fine. It's gonna
be fine.
KNOCKED UP - 34."
423,ALISON,423,Shit.
424,DEBBIE,424,You just need to call him.
425,ALISON,425,"Maybe I don't need to call him until
after I see the doctor."
426,DEBBIE,426,You need to call.
427,ALISON,427,"I don't want to call him. I don't need
to call him."
428,DEBBIE,428,You should call.
429,ALISON,429,"I can't call him anyway. He doesn't
even have a phone. He didn't even have
a number to give me."
430,DEBBIE,430,He doesn't have a phone?
431,ALISON,431,Said some kind of billing issue.
432,DEBBIE,432,"He can't afford a phone? Sadie has a
phone."
433,ALISON,433,"Shit, you're right. I got to call. I
don't know. I'm gonna have to look him
up on his stupid website."
434,DEBBIE,434,What kind of website does he have?
435,DEBBIE,435,"He spelling ""coming"" wrong. Oh it's
""cum."" That's gross."
436,ALISON,436,"Just go to ""Contact Us."""
437,DEBBIE,437,Ben?
438,ALISON,438,Yeah.
439,ALISON,439,KNOCKED UP - 35.
440,DEBBIE,440,"""What is your number? I need to speak
with you right away."" Send?"
441,ALISON,441,Yep.
442,DEBBIE,442,You're sure?
443,ALISON,443,Yeah.
444,JAY,444,I love weed.
445,JONAH,445,"I could smoke weed every second of
every day."
446,BEN,446,"(through the mask)
Jay, I am your stoner."
447,JASON,447,"Hey, Benjamin?"
448,BEN,448,Yeah.
449,JASON,449,"""Flesh of the Stars"" just got an e-
mail."
450,BEN,450,Really?
451,JASON,451,Would you like me to read it to you?
452,BEN,452,"Yeah, sure."
453,JASON,453,"""Ben, what is your number? I need to
speak to you right away. Alison Scott""
BEN, JASON & JONAH
Ohhhhhh!"
454,BEN,454,"Shit! Someone wants seconds, mama!
KNOCKED UP - 36."
455,JASON,455,"""Looking forward to speaking with
you."""
456,BEN,456,"Yeah. Do one of those smiley faces at
the end. Fuckin' A. Those are sexy."
457,JASON,457,Sent.
458,BEN,458,Uh-oh!
459,JAY,459,Somebody wants another piece!
460,BEN,460,Shhh....
461,"JAY
(WHISPERING)",461,"Booty, booty, booty call."
462,BEN,462,"(into the phone)
Hello?"
463,ALISON,463,"(into the phone)
Hi, Ben, this is Alison. I don't know
if you remember me."
464,BEN,464,"(into the phone)
Oh, yeah, Alison. What's up?"
465,JONAH,465,She like-a the way your dick tastes.
466,ALISON,466,"(into the phone)
I actually was just wondering if maybe
you, wanted to get together, like
tomorrow night?
KNOCKED UP - 37."
467,BEN,467,"(into the phone)
I've been meaning to call you so we
could hook up again. You know what I'm
sayin'?"
468,ALISON,468,"(into the phone)
Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night?
You wanna just grab some dinner?"
469,BEN,469,"(into the phone)
Why not? Meeting of minds sounds good.
What do you say Geisha House,
Hollywood, nine o'clock?"
470,ALISON,470,"(into the phone)
Sure. That's cool. Can we make it more
like six, though? I'd like to keep it
early."
471,BEN,471,"(into the phone)
Six o'clock. Beat the rush. Yeah,
leave more time for afterwards.
Dessert. Sweet."
472,ALISON,472,"(into the phone)
Okay. I'll just meet you there, then,
at six."
473,BEN,473,"(into the phone)
I'll see you there. Take care. Peace."
474,ALISON,474,"Oh, shit."
475,BEN,475,I'm gonna get laid mother fuckers!
476,BEN,476,"Nice place, huh?"
477,ALISON,477,It's really nice.
478,BEN,478,"Sorry it took so long to get a table.
I didn't realize you needed a
reservation.
KNOCKED UP - 38."
479,BEN,479,KNOCKED UP - 39.
480,BEN,480,KNOCKED UP - 40.
481,BEN,481,KNOCKED UP - 41.
482,ALISON,482,"I am going to the doctor next
week...and I thought you could come
with me to the gynecologist."
483,BEN,483,"So you haven't seen him, though?"
484,ALISON,484,No.
485,BEN,485,So you don't know if you're pregnant.
486,ALISON,486,"Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure."
487,BEN,487,"You're not a hundred percent sure. I
bet you're not pregnant."
488,BEN,488,"DR. PELLAGRINO'S NURSE
Alison Scott?"
489,ALISON,489,"Yeah, yeah."
490,(TO BEN),490,Come on.
491,BEN,491,I'm supposed to go?
492,ALISON,492,Yes.
493,ALISON,493,"DR. PELLAGRINO
Hello. My name is Thomas Pellagrino."
494,BEN,494,"I'm Ben Stone.
DR. PELLAGRINO
Hi, there, champ. And you must be
Debbie's sister...Alice."
495,ALISON,495,"Alison.
DR. PELLAGRINO
Hi. How are ya?
KNOCKED UP - 42."
496,ALISON,496,"Good.
DR. PELLAGRINO
So, what can I help you with today,
Mister and Mrs. Stone?"
497,ALISON,497,"I took a home pregnancy test and it
said I was pregnant, so here we are.
DR. PELLAGRINO
Let's have a look. Legs up."
498,BEN,498,"Nice office.
DR. PELLAGRINO
Thank you."
499,BEN,499,"DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd)
Well, you do look a lot like your
sister."
500,BEN,500,"DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd)
This is gonna be cold."
501,(TO BEN),501,And you're next. I'm just kidding.
502,(TO BEN),502,"DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
There's the cervix. And the uterus.
See that? That dark sac there, that's
the amniotic sac. And right there, in
the middle is the embryo. Do you see
that flicker? You know what that is?
That's the heartbeat. Yeah, it looks
like you are pregnant. About eight or
nine weeks, I'd say. Congratulations."
503,ALISON,503,"That, that's it?
DR. PELLAGRINO
Yep. Take good care of it. Now the fun
part starts. Let me make a picture for
ya, huh? That'll be fun."
504,ALISON,504,"DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Well, I'll meet ya in my office. I'll
give ya a little time alone, there.
KNOCKED UP - 43."
505,BEN,505,"Oh, God. It's okay."
506,JONAH,506,"I can't fuckin' believe you didn't
wear a bag! Who does that?!"
507,JASON,507,"Why did we go to Costco and buy a
year's supply of condoms if you
weren't gonna use `em, man?"
508,JONAH,508,"I can't believe you did this. You
fucked everything up."
509,JASON,509,"Look, the real point is not to get
yourself in this position. That's what
you have to realize. You gotta know
all the tricks. Like, for example, if
a woman's on top, she can't get
pregnant. It's just gravity."
510,JONAH,510,Everyone knows that.
511,JASON,511,What goes up must come down.
512,JAY,512,"I think it's awesome that you're gonna
have a kid, man. Think of it like
this. It's just an excuse to play with
all your old toys again."
513,JONAH,513,"You know what I think you should do?
Take care of it."
514,JAY,514,"Tell me you don't want him to get an
""A word."""
515,JONAH,515,"Yes, I do, and I won't say it for
little Baby Ears over there, but it
rhymes with shmish-mortion."" I'm just
saying -- hold on Jay, cover your ears
-- you should get a ""shmish-morshmion""
are the ""shmish-morshmion"" clinic."
516,JAY,516,"Ben, you cannot let these monsters
have any part of your child's life.
All right? I'm gonna be there to rear
your child.
KNOCKED UP - 44."
517,JASON,517,"You hear that, Ben? Don't let him near
the kid. He wants to rear your child!"
518,JONAH,518,"Aw, Ben. Ben, come on, man."
519,JASON,519,I'm just kidding you.
520,JAY,520,"Oh, great. Now he's upset."
521,JASON,521,I won't let him do it.
522,BETTY,522,"Alison, just take care of it. Take
care of it. Move on. What's gonna
happen with your career? Or how, how
are you gonna tell them?"
523,ALISON,523,"Well, I'm not gonna tell them for a
while. I have a while before I have to
say anything."
524,BETTY,524,How could you not tell them?
525,ALISON,525,"Well, they're not gonna know. I mean,
I'm only gonna start to show when I'm
like, I don't know, six months or
something. Seven months."
526,BETTY,526,Three months.
527,ALISON,527,No.
528,BETTY,528,"Three months. Fat in the face, jowls,
fast ass."
529,ALISON,529,Debbie didn't get fat.
530,BETTY,530,Debbie is a freak of nature.
531,ALISON,531,"Mom, you know, it's important to me
that you be supportive.
KNOCKED UP - 45."
532,BETTY,532,"I cannot be supportive of this. This
is a mistake. This is a big, big
mistake. Now think about your
stepsister. Now, you remember what
happened with her? She had the same
situation as you and she had it taken
care of. And you know what? Now she
has a real baby. Honey, this is not
the time."
533,HARRIS,533,I'm gonna be a grandfather.
534,BEN,534,You happy about that?
535,HARRIS,535,Absolutely. Delighted.
536,BEN,536,This is a disaster.
537,HARRIS,537,"No, this is not a disaster."
538,BEN,538,"It is, you know?"
539,HARRIS,539,"An earthquake is a disaster. Your
grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad
she doesn't even know who the fuck I
am, that's a disaster. This is a good
thing. This is a blessing."
540,BEN,540,"I had a vision for how my life would
go and this definitely is not it."
541,HARRIS,541,"Wait. Are you living your vision right
now?"
542,BEN,542,"I am kinda living my vision, yeah."
543,HARRIS,543,"Well, that is sad, I'm telling you.
Life doesn't care about your vision.
Okay?"
544,BEN,544,Okay.
545,HARRIS,545,"Stuff happens. You just got to deal
with it. Roll with it. That's the
beauty of it all.
KNOCKED UP - 46."
546,BEN,546,"I just don't get how I tell the kid
not to do drugs when I do drugs. I'll
feel like a hypocrite."
547,HARRIS,547,"Well you remember what I told you?
When you were a teenager?"
548,BEN,548,What did you say?
549,HARRIS,549,"I said, ""No pill, no powders."""
550,BEN,550,"That's right, that's right."
551,HARRIS,551,"Right. If it grows in the ground, it's
probably okay."
552,BEN,552,"I guess it worked. You told me not to
smoke pot all those years. And then I
found out you were smoking pot that
whole time."
553,HARRIS,553,"Not the whole time. Just in the
evenings and all day every weekend.
Not that much."
554,BEN,554,"Honestly, though, when you look at me,
do you not think at all, like, you
know, if he just never existed, I
would have avoided a massive heap of
trouble? You know?"
555,HARRIS,555,"Absolutely not. I love you totally and
completely. You're the best thing that
ever happened to me."
556,BEN,556,"I'm the best thing that ever happened
to you?"
557,HARRIS,557,Yeah.
558,BEN,558,Now I just feel bad for you.
559,BEN,559,KNOCKED UP - 47.
560,BEN,560,Hello?
561,ALISON,561,"Hi, Ben?"
562,BEN,562,"Hey Alison, how's it goin'?"
563,ALISON,563,"Good, good. You know, I was just
calling to, let you know that, I've
decided to keep the baby.That's what's
happening with that."
564,BEN,564,"Good. That's good. That's what I was
hoping you'd do. So, awesome."
565,ALISON,565,"Yeah, yeah, it is good."
566,BEN,566,"I know we didn't plan this and neither
of us really thought it was gonna
happen but life is like that, you
know? You can't plan for it and even
if we did, life doesn't care about
your plans, necessarily, and you just
kinda have to go with the flow and I
just know my job is to just support
you in whatever it is you wanna do.
I'm in, so whatever you wanna do, I'm
gonna do."
567,BEN(CONT'D),567,I'm on board. Yaaay.
568,ALISON,568,I really appreciate you saying that.
569,BEN,569,"No problem. I'll tell you, maybe if
you could help me by telling me, like
one thing that I am supposed to do,
then that would be good, `cause I
literally have no idea whatsoever."
570,ALISON,570,I have no idea either.
571,BEN,571,"Do you want to, like, get together and
talk about it or something like that?"
572,ALISON,572,"Yeah, sure."
573,BEN,573,"Like a date? I mean...
KNOCKED UP - 48."
574,ALISON,574,Yeah.
575,"BEN
HEY
ALISON",575,Hi.
576,BEN,576,You look beautiful.
577,ALISON,577,Thank you.
578,BEN,578,No problem. Come on in.
579,BEN (CONT'D),579,"Everyone, this is Alison."
580,ALISON,580,Hi.
581,JASON,581,"Ally. Hey. Jason. I'm sure you
remember."
582,ALISON,582,Yes.
583,JASON,583,You look beautiful.
584,ALISON,584,Thank you.
585,JASON,585,"Your body's responding really well to
the pregnancy."
586,ALISON,586,Thank you.
587,JASON,587,"It's amazing how fast the milk
arrives. How's your sis?"
588,ALISON,588,"She's good.
KNOCKED UP - 49."
589,JASON,589,"Oh, good. Tell her ""What's up"" for me."
590,ALISON,590,Okay.
591,JASON,591,"All right, I'm gonna go make a protein
shake."
592,BEN,592,"And this, uh, beautiful young man is
Jonah."
593,ALISON,593,Hi.
594,JONAH,594,Hey.
595,BEN,595,"Okay, that's Martin and Jodi over
there."
596,ALISON,596,Hi.
597,BEN,597,"I'm gonna grab my shirt. Just take a
seat if you want."
598,JONAH,598,"Just another day at the office. Do you
have any acting experience?"
599,ALISON,599,No.
600,MARTIN,600,How's it goin'? You wanna toke?
601,ALISON,601,"Eh, no. I'm good."
602,JODI,602,Hi.
603,ALISON,603,Hi.
604,JODI,604,I'm Jodi.
605,ALISON,605,"Yeah, hi."
606,JODI,606,I heard you were pregnant.
607,ALISON,607,"Mm-hm.
KNOCKED UP - 50."
608,JODI,608,"Oh, aren't you scared? The way it's
gonna come out of your...It's gonna
hurt a lot I bet. Your vagina...That's
so sick."
609,ALISON,609,I don't know.
610,JODI,610,Are you hungry?
611,ALISON,611,I'm okay right now. Thank you.
612,JODI,612,"You must be angry at the baby whenever
it steals your food, huh? ""Oh it's
mine, not yours."" But, you know...
Because you're family, you got to
share."
613,ALISON,613,Right.
614,JAY,614,"Man, my balls are shaved. My pubes are
trimmed. I'm ready to fuckin' rock
this shit."
615,JONAH,615,"What the fuck, man?! If I go in there
and see fuckin' pubes sprinkled on the
toiled seat, I'm gonna fuckin' lose my
mind! Last time I went to the
bathroom, Jay, I took a shit and my
shit looked like a fuckin' stuffed
animal!"
616,JAY,616,You're embarrassing me in company!
617,JONAH,617,You embarrass yourself!
618,JAY,618,"Oh, great. I hope you have a great
evening!"
619,BEN,619,"All right. Let's go. See you guys
later."
620,BEN,620,KNOCKED UP - 51.
621,ALISON,621,"The funny thing is I really had never
even thought about having a baby."
622,BEN,622,Yeah.
623,ALISON,623,"If this hadn't happened, I don't think
I would have wanted to have a baby
for, like, I don't know, at least ten
years."
624,BEN,624,"At least! God, honestly, I just got
used to the notion that someone would
even have sex with me. I didn't think
this would happen."
625,BEN,625,"Get ready. This will be coming out of
you in seven months. This is exactly
what our baby will look like."
626,ALISON,626,"It's a beautiful picture, Ben."
627,BEN,627,"It is. It's not bad.
(in a French accent)
Hello, Mommy. Our baby's gonna be
French Canadian. I like that."
628,ALISON,628,With a little hint of Spanish.
629,BEN,629,"Exactly, I'm not good with accents."
630,BEN,630,KNOCKED UP - 52.
631,BEN,631,Baby books.
632,ALISON,632,Awesome.
633,BEN,633,"""What to Expect When You're
Expecting."""
634,ALISON,634,What can we expect?
635,BEN,635,"Well, you can't eat sushi. You can't
smoke. You can't smoke marijuana. You
can't smoke crack. And you can't jump
on trampolines. This is basically a
giant list of things you can't do."
636,ALISON,636,It sounds thrilling.
637,BEN,637,"I'm gonna be sitting there on the
trampoline smoking crack. And you're
not gonna have anything to do. You're
gonna be bored. But I can't wait to
read these, honestly. I put these in
front of my toilet, though, they'll be
read by tomorrow morning. Do you want
me to get you that?"
638,ALISON,638,"Yeah, thank you."
639,BEN,639,No problem. These are heavy.
640,PETE,640,"So what do you think? Should we have
sex tonight?"
641,DEBBIE,641,"Ugh. Sounds awful. I'm just really
constipated. Do you really want to?"
642,PETE,642,"Well, now."
643,DEBBIE,643,"Shut up.
KNOCKED UP - 53."
644,PETE,644,"That's pretty crazy how your sister's
pregnant."
645,DEBBIE,645,We have to help her.
646,PETE,646,"I think they'll be fine. They'll work
it...Look at us. It happened to us."
647,DEBBIE,647,We'll help her raise the baby.
648,PETE,648,Well...fuck!
649,BEN,649,"At least we don't have to use a
condom, you know?"
650,BEN,650,"BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
But we can. I brought some just in
case. I don't have V.D. or anything. I
mean, I don't, I thought--"
651,ALISON,651,It's not that.
652,BEN,652,"It's just I thought we could get a
little...fun out of your situation,
you know?"
653,ALISON,653,"Okay, first of all, it's not my
situation. It's our situation."
654,BEN,654,I know that.
655,ALISON,655,"And just because I'm pregnant, I'm not
some ruined woman and all romance goes
out the door."
656,BEN,656,"I'm sorry. I like you a lot. That's
all this is."
657,ALISON,657,"I like you, too.
KNOCKED UP - 54."
658,BEN,658,Sweet.
659,ALISON,659,"A little, so far. I mean, we have
seven months before the baby comes. We
don't have to rush it."
660,BEN,660,Yeah.
661,ALISON,661,"We should really just try to get to
know each other and...give this a real
shot. You know? We got ourselves into
this situation. We kind of have to."
662,BEN,662,"For the baby, right?"
663,ALISON,663,"Exactly. Okay, if this was our second
date, what would you do?"
664,BEN,664,"B.J. If I'm just being honest. I told
my roommates that I thought I was
gonna get a B.J., so..."
665,ALISON,665,"You know what? For the sake of getting
to know one another, can you not talk
like that?"
666,BEN,666,I can do that. I'm really nervous.
667,ALISON,667,"I'm nervous, too. I'm really nervous."
668,BEN,668,Yeah.
669,ALISON,669,"You're a sweet guy, right?"
670,BEN,670,I think I am.
671,ALISON,671,"Don't fuck me over, okay?"
672,BEN,672,"I wouldn't do that. Just so you know,
I'm the guy girls fuck over. I'm that
guy. So you don't fuck me over, okay?"
673,ALISON,673,Okay.
674,BEN,674,"I couldn't take it. I can't raise this
baby alone.
KNOCKED UP - 55."
675,CHARLOTTE,675,Who's he?
676,BEN,676,I'm Ben Stone.
677,ALISON,677,He's my boyfriend.
678,PETE,678,That's nice.
679,SADIE,679,I never met him before.
680,ALISON,680,He's a new boyfriend.
681,BEN,681,But a boyfriend.
682,SADIE,682,"So he came over for breakfast because
he's your new boyfriend?"
683,DEBBIE,683,"He came from his house, drove over to
our house because he thought it would
be fun to have breakfast with us, so
he drove his car from his house to our
house to have breakfast."
684,PETE,684,Because he likes breakfast so much.
685,CHARLOTTE,685,I love breakfast.
686,BEN,686,"You guys wanna hear something neat?
We're gonna have a baby together."
687,SADIE,687,What?
688,BEN,688,"Yeah, a baby."
689,SADIE,689,"Well, you're not married. Aren't you
supposed to be married to have a baby?
KNOCKED UP - 56."
690,PETE,690,You don't have to be.
691,DEBBIE,691,"But they should be because they love
each other and people who love each
other get married and have babies."
692,SADIE,692,Where do babies come from?
693,DEBBIE,693,Where do you think they come from?
694,SADIE,694,"Well, I think a stork, he drops it
down, and then, a hole goes in your
body and there's blood everywhere,
coming out of your head, and then you
push your belly-button, and then your
butt falls off and then you hold you
butt and you have to dig and you find
a little baby."
695,DEBBIE,695,That's exactly right.
696,CHARLOTTE,696,Feed the teddy bear.
697,BEN,697,"I feed your bear the grass? Know what
your bear would also like to do with
some grass? Smoke it."
698,"ALISON
(TO DEBBIE)",698,"What do you think of him? He's funny,
right?"
699,BEN,699,"Fetch. All right, bring it back."
700,"DEBBIE
(TO ALISON)",700,"He's playing fetch with my kids. He's
treating my kids like they're dogs."
701,"ALISON
(TO DEBBIE)",701,No's he not.
702,"ALISON
(TO DEBBIE)",702,KNOCKED UP - 57.
703,BEN,703,Go get it! Fetch!
704,"DEBBIE
(TO ALISON)",704,Plays fetch with the kids.
705,BEN,705,All right!
706,"ALISON
(TO DEBBIE)",706,He's trying. He's making an effort.
707,CHARLOTTE,707,I don't wanna play this anymore.
708,BEN,708,Bring it back.
709,"DEBBIE
(TO ALISON)",709,"He's overweight. Where does that end?
How old is he?"
710,"ALISON
(TO DEBBIE)",710,Twenty-three.
711,"DEBBIE
(TO ALISON)",711,"Looks thirty-three. He can barely get
in and out of that little house.
Imagine how much bigger he's going to
get."
712,DEBBIE (CONT'D),712,"That means he has bad genes. Your kid
is going to be overweight."
713,ALISON,713,Shit.
714,BEN,714,I'm gonna get you!
715,BEN (CONT'D),715,I'm gonna get you! Whoa!
716,"ALISON
(TO DEBBIE)",716,Just give him a break.
717,"DEBBIE
(TO ALISON)",717,"Okay, I'll try.
KNOCKED UP - 58."
718,BEN,718,They seem to love bubbles.
719,PETE,719,They go ape-shit over bubbles.
720,BEN,720,They're really going ape-shit.
721,PETE,721,"That's an incredible thing about a
child. What's so great about bubbles?"
722,BEN,722,"They float. You can pop them. I mean,
I get it. I get it."
723,PETE,723,"I wish I liked anything as much as my
kids like bubbles."
724,BEN,724,That's sad.
725,PETE,725,"It's totally sad. Their smiling faces
just point out your inability to enjoy
anything."
726,BEN,726,"Am I going to be okay, man?"
727,PETE,727,"Who knows? Is anybody okay? I'm not
okay. You're asking the wrong guy.
Just don't ask me to lend you any
money, you know?"
728,BEN,728,Can I just have some?
729,PETE,729,No.
730,JASON,730,"I have fifteen years of tennis
lessons.
KNOCKED UP - 59."
731,JONAH,731,KNOCKED UP - 60.
732,JASON,732,"I thought you went to Santa Monica
City College."
733,JONAH,733,"I went where I went, Jason."
734,BEN,734,"I'm not asking you to work twelve
hours a day. I mean, you guys watch
movies without nudity in them."
735,JASON,735,"I'll tell you what, man. We could
probably get it online in three
months."
736,BEN,736,Thank you. Yes! Three months.
737,JONAH,737,"Come on, Jason!"
738,JONAH (CONT'D),738,Fuck off!
739,JASON,739,"Yeah, well, you still have a little
dick, Cartman."
740,JASON,740,"DR. KUNI
Do you smoke cigarettes?"
741,ALISON,741,"No.
DR. KUNI
Do you smoke cigarettes?"
742,ALISON,742,"I have on occasion.
DR. KUNI
On occasion? When? When was the last
time you had one cig? You know, on,
you know, a little...I need to know or
I will not be your doctor.
KNOCKED UP - 61."
743,ALISON,743,How ya doing?
744,BEN,744,"I'm breathing like James Gandolfini
over here."
745,BEN (CONT'D),745,"(to nearby athlete)
Slow down, man. You're making me look
like a jackass."
746,YOUNG DOCTOR,746,How long you kids been married?
747,BEN,747,We're not.
748,ALISON,748,No.
749,YOUNG DOCTOR,749,You're single?
750,BEN,750,"She's not single. She's just not
married."
751,YOUNG DOCTOR,751,Are you two together?
752,JODI,752,"Hey, you wanna trade boyfriends? Just
kidding. Kind of."
753,JODI,753,KNOCKED UP - 62.
754,FEMALE DOCTOR,754,"Wow. That is not your vagina. That's
your asshole. That happens about five
times a day."
755,JAY,755,"Are you sure you don't want to come
paint-balling?"
756,BEN,756,"Have fun, guys. Seriously, watch the
eyes."
757,JAY,757,All right.
758,JASON,758,"See ya, Ally."
759,JONAH,759,Peace.
760,JAY,760,Bye.
761,BEN,761,"I don't want to go. I swear to God. I
want to see ""Breathless"" at the LACMA."
762,ALISON,762,Boobs! Boobs! Boobs!
763,BEN,763,"Hold on, pause it, pause it, pause it."
764,ALISON,764,Boobs and bush.
765,ALISON (CONT'D),765,Good boobs.
766,BEN,766,"Those are good ones! We're like thirty-
five seconds in."
767,ALISON,767,"Right over the beginning credits.
KNOCKED UP - 63."
768,BEN,768,"Nice. Credit bush. You never get
opening-credit bush."
769,ALISON,769,I know. That's so crazy.
770,BEN,770,You got me. You got me.
771,ALISON,771,"How many doctors are there in your
practice? Just because I'm sort of
looking for a more personal
experience. I want to make sure that
you're my doctor on the day and...
DR. HOWARD
I understand. We have three other
doctors in the practice but I'm your
man, okay? I don't take vacations. I
hate Hawaii. I went to the Caribbean
when I was fourteen and I'm never
going back."
772,ALISON,772,I feel really good about this.
773,(TO BEN),773,I think we found our doctor.
774,BEN,774,Really?
775,ALISON,775,Yeah.
776,BEN,776,"Oh, my God. Are you serious right now?
DR. HOWARD
You look relieved."
777,BEN,777,"I am very relieved.
DR. HOWARD
All right."
778,BEN,778,"I can't imagine meeting and more of
you people.
KNOCKED UP - 64."
779,ALISON,779,"You're being dramatic. We didn't meet
that many."
780,WARDROBE LADY,780,Ooh. Do they know?
781,ALISON,781,Pardon?
782,WARDROBE LADY,782,The belly.
783,ALISON,783,"The doughnuts, they call to me."
784,JILL,784,"Hey, Alison!"
785,ALISON,785,Hi.
786,JILL,786,Great job.
787,ALISON,787,Thanks.
788,"JILL
(TO HERSELF)",788,For you.
789,WARDROBE LADY,789,You're pregnant aren't you?
790,ALISON,790,What?
791,WARDROBE LADY,791,"I mean, you've put on like eight
pounds, nine. It's all in your uterus."
792,ALISON,792,"Oh, shit. I haven't told them. Do you
think they're gonna be mad? I'm really
chickening out about this."
793,WARDROBE LADY,793,"It's okay. We can hide this. We'll
dress you in black and we'll emphasize
your boobs.
KNOCKED UP - 65."
794,ALISON,794,Awesome.
795,WARDROBE LADY,795,"Your boobs are going to be big. And
then they're going to be like scary
big. But then they'll go down. And
then they'll stay down."
796,ALISON,796,"Just don't say anything, okay? Please
don't say anything."
797,WARDROBE LADY,797,"I won't. Just tell them. They'll be
cool. Everybody loves somebody
pregnant."
798,DEBBIE,798,"Ooh. Did you see this sex offender
website? These are all the sex
offenders in our neighborhood."
799,PETE,799,"Looks like your computer has chicken
pox."
800,DEBBIE,800,"Those are sex offenders. These people
live in our neighborhood."
801,PETE,801,"We'll skip their houses when we're
trick or treating. What do you want me
to do? Form a posse?"
802,(TO BEN),802,"Got your six-shooter on ya? I got my
lynching rope."
803,DEBBIE,803,You shouldn't take it so lightly.
804,PETE,804,"I don't take it lightly. I'm not going
to go over to any of these people's
houses and say, ""Hey, you mind? Can
you baby sit?"""
805,DEBBIE,805,"If I didn't care about these things,
you wouldn't care about anything. Care
more.
KNOCKED UP - 66."
806,PETE,806,"You're so concerned with stuff, like
don't get them vaccinated, don't let
them eat fish. There's mercury in the
water. Jesus, how much ""Dateline NBC""
can you watch?"
807,DEBBIE,807,"I know we're supposed to be nice with
each other right now, but I'm having a
really hard time. I'm struggling with
it right now."
808,PETE,808,What am I doing?
809,DEBBIE,809,"Because I want to rip your fucking
head off because you're so fucking
stupid! This is scary."
810,DEBBIE (CONT'D),810,"These are our children. You fucking
dipshit!"
811,PETE,811,"I literally am at a point where I
don't know what I can say."
812,DEBBIE,812,"So I'm the bad guy because I'm trying
to protect our kids from child
molesters and mercury? And you're cool
because you don't give a shit?"
813,PETE,813,Yeah.
814,DEBBIE,814,Yeah? Is that it?
815,PETE,815,Pretty much.
816,DEBBIE,816,"God, you're an asshole."
817,PETE,817,Don't do this in front of Ben.
818,DEBBIE,818,I don't give a shit about Ben.
819,PETE,819,"Sorry, Ben."
820,BEN,820,"It's okay. I didn't think she did,
anyway."
821,ALISON,821,"Okay, come on! Let's go.
KNOCKED UP - 67."
822,PETE,822,"I can't go. This band is doing a
showcase out in the Valley. I got to
go."
823,DEBBIE,823,It's Saturday.
824,PETE,824,I got to go.
825,DEBBIE,825,"You don't want to know the sex of the
baby? That's no fun."
826,ALISON,826,"Ben knows, but I've sworn him to
secrecy."
827,DEBBIE,827,I'll get it out of him.
828,BEN,828,"Hey. Think we'll ever be as happy as
Baby Bjorn couple is?"
829,ALISON,829,We are that happy.
830,BEN,830,Yeah. You look happy.
831,ALISON,831,"Which is awesome. Because I never like
guys like you. It's great."
832,BEN,832,You keep saying that. I know.
833,DEBBIE,833,This is it. This is perfect.
834,BEN,834,Nice.
835,BEN (CONT'D),835,"Holy shit, it's fourteen hundred
bucks.
KNOCKED UP - 68."
836,"ALISON
(TO DEBBIE)",836,"We can just borrow yours. Is that
okay?"
837,DEBBIE,837,No. You need your own crib.
838,BEN,838,"There's one of these in an alley
behind my house. We could just grab
that. Just rub Purell all over it."
839,DEBBIE,839,"You know what? Let me buy it. I need
to get you a baby present anyway, and
I would love to get it for you."
840,ALISON,840,No.
841,DEBBIE,841,I'm serious. I want to.
842,ALISON,842,No. It's too much.
843,BEN,843,"(whispering to Alison)
Shh. Yes. We'll take it obviously. I
mean don't insult the woman. She wants
to get us a gift."
844,DEBBIE,844,Right.
845,BEN,845,"Want to buy me some new clothes? What
else can I squeeze out of you?
XBOX360, XBOX360."
846,ALISON,846,It's so hot in the Valley.
847,GIRL #1,847,Hey!
848,GIRL #2,848,"Oh, my God!"
849,ALISON,849,"Oh, shit."
850,GIRL #1,850,"Alison!
KNOCKED UP - 69."
851,BEN,851,KNOCKED UP - 70.
852,ALISON,852,All right.
853,BEN,853,"You know they say don't drink and
drive?"
854,GUY #1,854,Right.
855,BEN,855,Don't drink and bone!
856,GIRL #2,856,Wow.
857,BEN,857,"Yeah, she was acting weird and I
really think it's just because I
haven't made an honest woman out of
her. She's carrying my bastard child.
No one wants that."
858,PETE,858,"That's what I did. I married Debbie
when she got pregnant."
859,BEN,859,"You think she's, like, hiding me?
Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me
or something like that?"
860,PETE,860,Probably. I'd hide you.
861,BEN,861,How much do wedding rings cost?
862,PETE,862,"It really depends, you know? I think
you're supposed to spend three months
pay on a ring."
863,BEN,863,"That'll be easy. I don't make any
money."
864,PETE,864,"Really? I thought there was a lot of
money in porn.
KNOCKED UP - 71."
865,BEN,865,"God, it's not porn? All we do is we
show you what nude scenes are in what
movies."
866,PETE,866,Like Mister Skin?
867,BEN,867,Who's Mister Skin?
868,PETE,868,"Dude, Mister Skin."
869,JONAH,869,"We've wasted fourteen months of our
lives."
870,BEN,870,"This is exactly the same as our site.
How the fuck did this happen?"
871,JONAH,871,"Mister Skin! That's even a better name
than ours!"
872,MARTIN,872,"Well, fuck me in the beard."
873,JASON,873,"Dude, they got the top ten group
shower scenes! Why didn't you think of
that, Jay!"
874,JAY,874,Don't put this on me!
875,BEN,875,God damn it!
876,MARTIN,876,"Well shit. I saw it online at one
point, but I guess I didn't connect
the dots."
877,JONAH,877,What are we gonna do now?
878,BEN,878,"All we need to do is think of a new,
better idea that no one else has
thought of already."
879,JASON,879,"""Spiderman Three"" starts in eight
minutes.
KNOCKED UP - 72."
880,JONAH,880,"Shit. Don't worry. We'll figure it
out."
881,BEN,881,"You know what? Just because this site
exists doesn't mean ours won't work.
Good things come in pairs."
882,JAY,882,For sure.
883,BEN,883,"""Volcano,"" ""Dante's Peak."" ""Deep
Impact,"" ""Armageddon."" ""Wyatt Earp,""

885,BEN,885,"Exactly. We can work together. This
helps us, if anything."
886,JAY,886,We're golden.
887,BEN,887,"Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you
pictured it being exactly and it's not
how I wanted it. That is why I'm
presenting you with this empty box.
It's a promise, Alison. A promise that
one day I will fill this with a ring
that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I
can't afford it yet. I've picked it
out, though. It's at De Beers and it's
really nice. So, basically, I'm asking
you, will you marry me? Because I'm in
love with you."
888,ALISON,888,I love you too.
889,BEN,889,"Really? That's so nice to hear. That's
the first time a girl's ever said that
to me."
890,ALISON,890,"But here's the thing.
KNOCKED UP - 73."
891,BEN,891,There's a thing?
892,ALISON,892,"I don't really know yet what that love
means. It's so new and it's so
exciting. It's great. I don't know.
We've only known each other for
seventeen weeks."
893,BEN,893,"Look, I thought you felt weird that
we're having a baby and we're not
engaged. I'm going to get off my knee.
It hurts."
894,ALISON,894,"I'm okay with that. We're just doing
what we can. I don't want us to put
any more pressure on ourselves than we
have."
895,BEN,895,That makes sense.
896,ALISON,896,"I didn't hurt your feelings, did I?"
897,BEN,897,"No. I just wanted to do right by you.
If you don't want to, that's totally
cool."
898,ALISON,898,I really do love you.
899,BEN,899,"I know. Thanks. You mentioned that.
It's nice."
900,ALISON,900,"Ben proposed to me. He did. It was
really sweet. I feel a little bad. He
was wearing this great button-down. He
tucked it in. He got down on one knee.
He didn't have an actual ring, though,
just an empty box but he had this
whole spiel about when he has the
money, he'll buy me the ring I
deserve."
901,DEBBIE,901,The box was empty?
902,ALISON,902,"He can't afford a ring.
KNOCKED UP - 74."
903,DEBBIE,903,"So he got down on one knee and gave
you an empty box?"
904,ALISON,904,Yes.
905,DEBBIE,905,I'm sorry.
906,ALISON,906,"Get over it. If you'd been there, you
would have cried."
907,DEBBIE,907,"You need to train him. Oprah said that
when two people meet they should point
out each other's differences and
flaws."
908,ALISON,908,"I thought you should love people for
who they are."
909,DEBBIE,909,"You criticize them a lot, so they get
so down on themselves they have to
change."
910,ALISON,910,You don't think that's naggy?
911,DEBBIE,911,"In the end, they thank you for it."
912,DEBBIE,912,"You can't commit to him. You don't
even know him. I don't even know Pete
after ten years. I don't know what
he's up to. He's miserable."
913,ALISON,913,Why do you say that?
914,DEBBIE,914,"I think he's cheating on me. He's
always going to business meetings at
odd hours. Then I try to call him on
his cell phone and he says he's in bad
cell phone reception areas when he's
in good reception areas."
915,ALISON,915,"Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's
trying to sign a new band. I can't
imagine Pete doing that."
916,DEBBIE,916,"There's no part of you that thinks
maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?
KNOCKED UP - 75."
917,ALISON,917,No.
918,DEBBIE,918,I think he might be.
919,DEBBIE,919,"""Memory Spy Web Memory Software.

hide from me now, little man."
920,PETE,920,You're not going to tell them?
921,ALISON,921,"No. I don't have to. It's illegal for
them to fire me over it. And I get
three months maternity leave if I
stay. So I'm not going to tell them."
922,DEBBIE,922,Good plan.
923,PETE,923,I like it.
924,BEN,924,"It's a good plan until her water
breaks over Robert De Niro's shoes.
(impersonating Robert De"
925,NIRO),925,My shoes. There's baby goo on them.
926,PETE,926,(impersonating Robert De
927,NIRO),927,"These shoes? On these shoes? Did you
puke on my shoes?"
928,BEN,928,(impersonating Robert De
929,NIRO),929,"Is your water on my shoes?
KNOCKED UP - 76."
930,PETE,930,"(back as Pete)
Isn't it weird, though, when you have
a kid and all your dreams and hopes go
right out the window."
931,DEBBIE,931,"What changed for you? What went out
the window? You do everything exactly
the same."
932,PETE,932,"No, I love what I'm doing. But say
before you're married with children
you want to live in India for a year.
You can do it."
933,DEBBIE,933,"You want to go to India? Go to India!
Seriously."
934,PETE,934,Do you want to go to India?
935,DEBBIE,935,No. You can go.
936,BEN,936,"I get what he means. Honestly, when I
found out about..."
937,BEN (CONT'D),937,"...I had this flash of me in a white
Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada.
The chopper's taping it, and I bust
through the border and I'm free! I
kept thinking that."
938,BEN (CONT'D),938,It was a flash!
939,ALISON,939,What do you mean?
940,BEN,940,"Don't look at me. We can talk about
our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched
up to you in the DeLorean and said,
""Alison, I got the car here. What do
you want to do?"" No part of you would
think, ""Maybe I'll go back to that
night and put a condom on Ben's dick?""
You never got that flash?"
941,ALISON,941,No. What are you talking about?
942,PETE,942,"""Where we're going, we don't need
roads.""
KNOCKED UP - 77."
943,BEN,943,You wouldn't do that?
944,ALISON,944,"I don't know who Doc Brown is. What
are you talking about?"
945,BEN,945,"Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He
invented the DeLorean time machine."
946,PETE,946,Everyone has a time machine image.
947,DEBBIE,947,"I have a really good idea. Why don't
you two get in your time machine, go
back in time and fuck each other?"
948,PETE,948,Who needs a time machine?
949,BEN,949,This is my time machine!
950,"PETE
(TO BEN)",950,"I'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun
it to 88."
951,"BEN
(TO PETE)",951,"You are a funny motherfucker, man."
952,(TO DEBBIE),952,"How can you fight with him? I just
want to kiss his face. He's cute."
953,"PETE
(TO BEN)",953,I like the way you move.
954,BEN,954,"This is fun! We should do this more.
This is the most fun I've had in a
really long time."
955,ALISON,955,"Come on, harder."
956,BEN,956,"I can't.
KNOCKED UP - 78."
957,ALISON,957,Why? Just do it deeper.
958,BEN,958,I can't.
959,ALISON,959,Why?
960,BEN,960,I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.
961,ALISON,961,Just do it!
962,BEN,962,Please don't yell at me.
963,ALISON,963,"The doctor and Debbie said it's fine.
Come on!"
964,BEN,964,"I'm sorry, can we change positions?
I'm going to crush the baby."
965,ALISON,965,That's ridiculous!
966,BEN,966,"No, it's not. It has no shell."
967,ALISON,967,"Millions of people have sex when
they're pregnant! It just works!"
968,BEN,968,I weigh over 200 pounds.
969,ALISON,969,Just get over it.
970,BEN,970,"I can't do it. Can you just get on
top? All I can see if our baby, poked
in the face by my penis."
971,ALISON,971,"Trust me, you're not even close. Okay,
fine."
972,ALISON (CONT'D),972,"I can't do this. I can't focus like
this. I look disgusting from this
angle. I can feel you looking at my
chins."
973,BEN,973,"You look beautiful. Your chin looks so
skinny.
KNOCKED UP - 79."
974,ALISON,974,"And my boobs are all like, squishy and
they're flopping around. I can feel it
and it's distracting. It's all
National Geographic."
975,"BEN
(WHISPERING)",975,Do you want to do it doggie style?
976,ALISON,976,"No. I do not want you to fuck me like
a dog."
977,BEN,977,"I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's
doggie style. It's just the style.
I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't
have to go outside or anything."
978,BEN (CONT'D),978,Here we go. Is it good?
979,ALISON,979,Yeah.
980,BEN,980,Should I go slower?
981,ALISON,981,Harder.
982,BEN,982,Just tell me when you're close.
983,ALISON,983,Just go harder.
984,BEN,984,Okay.
985,ALISON,985,Keep going!
986,BEN,986,"Oh, God. Oh, fuck!"
987,ALISON,987,What happened?
988,BEN,988,The baby. It kicked my hand.
989,ALISON,989,It always kicks.
990,BEN,990,"No, no, no, no, no.
KNOCKED UP - 80."
991,ALISON,991,It's fine.
992,BEN,992,"Not like this. No, this was a warning
kick."
993,ALISON,993,Just keep going.
994,BEN,994,This was a bad kick.
995,ALISON,995,It's fine! It's fine!
996,BEN,996,"Look. My dick must be like an inch
away from its face and it's coming,
just coming in at its face. What if it
kicked because it didn't like it? I
can't do that to our baby. That's the
first thing it's going to see."
997,ALISON,997,What are you talking about?
998,BEN,998,"It's having the baby between us, it
just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It
just freaks me out a bit. It's a
little weird."
999,ALISON,999,I have totally lost it now.
1000,BEN,1000,You've totally lost it?
1001,ALISON,1001,I've lost it.
1002,BEN,1002,Okay.
1003,ALISON,1003,"Great, you know what? Just forget it."
1004,ALISON (CONT'D),1004,"(holding back tears)
Don't worry. I won't make you do this
again."
1005,BEN,1005,Shit.
1006,BEN,1006,KNOCKED UP - 81.
1007,ALISON,1007,Ben?
1008,BEN,1008,Fuck me.
1009,JAY,1009,Oh my God! It's the Russians.
1010,MARTIN,1010,Jodi! I'll protect you!
1011,ALISON,1011,Ben!
1012,BEN,1012,"Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, no!"
1013,JAY,1013,"That was horrible! That was so
horrible."
1014,JASON,1014,"You're fine, man."
1015,JAY,1015,When will it be light out?
1016,JASON,1016,Take it easy.
1017,JAY,1017,When will it be light out?
1018,JASON,1018,Did anybody turn off the gas?
1019,MARTIN,1019,"I didn't do it.
KNOCKED UP - 82."
1020,JASON,1020,"Oh, motherfucker."
1021,JONAH,1021,"Martin, this is my friend, Alex. She's
a pretty incredible person."
1022,MARTIN,1022,Nice to meet you.
1023,JONAH,1023,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude! Not cool,
Martin."
1024,MARTIN,1024,"That's, that wasn't..."
1025,JONAH,1025,"Hey, are you serious, Howard Hughes?"
1026,JODI,1026,What happened?
1027,MARTIN,1027,Nothing. Nothing happened. Come on.
1028,"ALISON
(TO BEN)",1028,Where were you?
1029,BEN,1029,"Look, I forgot you were sleeping over.
I'm sorry okay?"
1030,ALISON,1030,"Yeah, because you were getting high
off your huge bong. How am I supposed
to be comfortable with the idea that
you can take care of me and the baby
if you are always getting high?"
1031,BEN,1031,"You want me to stop smoking pot
because there's an earthquake once
every ten years? That makes no sense,
Alison. You're being irrational. Just
relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the
cops."
1032,BEN (CONT'D),1032,"California. Hey!
KNOCKED UP - 83."
1033,BEN,1033,"You know it's times like this I'm glad
I don't own nice things. It's a big
mess, but there's only like fifty
bucks worth of shit here. That's kind
of the good thing. You know, my dad
told me, ""Don't move to Northridge.""
But you figure, what are the chances
of that happening twice, you know?"
1034,ALISON,1034,What is this?
1035,BEN,1035,"It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place
doesn't get condemned. That would
suck."
1036,BEN,1036,Hello?
1037,ALISON,1037,Hey it's me.
1038,BEN,1038,You!
1039,ALISON,1039,"Hi! So, listen. Will you do me a big
favor? Debbie wants us to come over
and have dinner tonight. She thinks
Pete is cheating on her.
KNOCKED UP - 84."
1040,BEN,1040,Really?
1041,ALISON,1041,"Yeah. Well, she saw one of his e-mails
and there's an address. Ugh."
1042,BEN,1042,"Oh, man. I don't want to do that."
1043,ALISON,1043,"Ben, come on."
1044,BEN,1044,He's not cheating on her.
1045,ALISON,1045,How do you know?
1046,BEN,1046,I just know.
1047,ALISON,1047,Are you sure?
1048,BEN,1048,"I'm one hundred percent sure he's not
cheating."
1049,ALISON,1049,Are you really?
1050,BEN,1050,"No. It actually kind of makes sense
that he would cheat."
1051,ALISON,1051,Why?
1052,BEN,1052,"Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and
Pete's awesome?"
1053,ALISON,1053,"Well, why don't you just come over
then, and, we'll just diffuse the
situation a little?"
1054,PETE,1054,"I'm just saying the music industry is
different now. Steely Dan would never
even have a chance."
1055,BEN,1055,"Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan
gargles my balls."
1056,PETE,1056,"They're incredible.
KNOCKED UP - 85."
1057,BEN,1057,"They really aren't good, man."
1058,PETE,1058,Old Steely Dan.
1059,BEN,1059,"If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want
you to slice my head off with an Al
Jarreau LP."
1060,PETE,1060,"I should get going. I'm supposed to
see this band tonight in Hollywood.
Actually, they're playing in Laurel
Canyon, so I'll call you because the
reception's terrible over there."
1061,BEN,1061,That's true.
1062,PETE,1062,"And I don't want you to worry. I'm
just going to jump in the shower. It
would be terrible if I smelled worse
than the band."
1063,DEBBIE,1063,Okay. Have fun.
1064,BEN,1064,"You guys are crazy. He's acting
totally normal and hilarious."
1065,"BEN
(TO ALISON)",1065,"She doesn't have a gun, does she?"
1066,ALISON,1066,No. I don't think so.
1067,BEN,1067,"Oh, great."
1068,BEN,1068,Looks like no one's home.
1069,DEBBIE,1069,"Why was the door unlocked? Wait here.
KNOCKED UP - 86."
1070,BEN,1070,I just feel bad for Pete.
1071,ALISON,1071,What?
1072,BEN,1072,"I feel like this isn't a good way to
get caught cheating, it shouldn't be
like this."
1073,ALISON,1073,"Well, maybe he should have thought of
that before he was cheating."
1074,BEN,1074,"(through a fake cough)
Pete!"
1075,ALISON,1075,Stop it.
1076,BEN,1076,I coughed. What do you want from me?
1077,DEBBIE,1077,There's nobody up there.
1078,BEN,1078,Thank you.
1079,DEBBIE,1079,I guess I was wrong.
1080,BEN,1080,"I told you. Can we get out of here,
please?"
1081,ALISON,1081,"Yeah, come on. Let's go."
1082,DEBBIE,1082,Did you hear that?
1083,ALISON,1083,What?
1084,BEN,1084,I didn't hear anything.
1085,ALISON,1085,Come on.
1086,ALISON,1086,"FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1

KNOCKED UP - 87."
1087,PETE,1087,"Carlos Delgado.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2
Excellent choice. Too bad I got him
three rounds ago.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1
You're still on the clock."
1088,PETE,1088,"Oh shit!
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1
You gotta do something. We need a name
here."
1089,PETE,1089,"Hideki Matsui.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1
Ugh, you just took my whole outfield."
1090,PETE,1090,"Sorry, Charlie."
1091,DEBBIE,1091,What is this?
1092,PETE,1092,Debbie.
1093,DEBBIE,1093,What the fuck is this?
1094,PETE,1094,"It's our fantasy baseball draft.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2
We said no wives."
1095,DEBBIE,1095,Your fantasy what?
1096,PETE,1096,"It's, it's our draft...for fantasy
baseball. I told you all about this.
Got Matsui."
1097,PETE (CONT'D),1097,"Aw, shit.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2
Hey, Pete, don't let the door hit you
in the vagina on the way out! Come on,
who's going?"
1098,PETE (CONT'D),1098,KNOCKED UP - 88.
1099,PETE,1099,KNOCKED UP - 89.
1100,DEBBIE,1100,"Well, what did you do last Wednesday
night when you said you went to see a
band?"
1101,PETE,1101,I went to the movies.
1102,DEBBIE,1102,With who?
1103,PETE,1103,By myself.
1104,DEBBIE,1104,What'd you see?
1105,PETE,1105,"""Spiderman Three."""
1106,DEBBIE,1106,"Why do you want to go by yourself? Why
didn't you ask me to go?"
1107,PETE,1107,"Because I needed to get away, you
know? With work and you and the kids,
sometimes I just need some time to
myself."
1108,DEBBIE,1108,"I need time for myself. I want time
for myself, too."
1109,DEBBIE (CONT'D),1109,You're not the only one.
1110,PETE,1110,It's not that big of a deal.
1111,"DEBBIE
(THROUGH TEARS)",1111,I like Spiderman.
1112,PETE,1112,"Okay, so let's see ""Spiderman Three""
next week."
1113,DEBBIE,1113,I don't want to go see it now.
1114,PETE,1114,Well...
1115,DEBBIE,1115,"I don't want to have to ask you to ask
me. I want you to just come up with it
on your own."
1116,PETE,1116,"What? I don't even know what to say.
Uh, what do you want me to do?
KNOCKED UP - 90."
1117,DEBBIE,1117,"You just think because you don't yell
that you're not mean, but this is
mean."
1118,PETE,1118,"I'm not being mean. I'm being honest.
You're telling me I need to be honest."
1119,"JUST--
DEBBIE",1119,"No, you're not. You're lying."
1120,PETE,1120,"I'm doing it because I need to keep my
sanity a little bit."
1121,DEBBIE,1121,"You know what? I don't want you at the
house anymore. Okay?"
1122,PETE,1122,Come on.
1123,BEN,1123,"Oh, shit, she's coming back."
1124,BEN,1124,"How come we go to the gynecologist so
often? I bet we have to go so much so
we can pay for that three-hundred-
thousand-dollar machine he has."
1125,ALISON,1125,"I cannot stop thinking about what an
asshole Pete is."
1126,BEN,1126,"That's a little strong, I would say."
1127,ALISON,1127,"Really? Because that had to be one of
the most selfish things I've ever
witnessed."
1128,BEN,1128,"It's understandable. I even think it's
kind of funny."
1129,ALISON,1129,What's funny about it?
1130,BEN,1130,"Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't
imagine, but you know, the situation."
1131,(MORE),1131,KNOCKED UP - 91.
1132,ALISON,1132,KNOCKED UP - 92.
1133,BEN,1133,I have.
1134,ALISON,1134,"I've had to sacrifice my job, my body,
my youth, my vagina!"
1135,BEN,1135,You've sacrificed your vagina?
1136,ALISON,1136,"Yes! It will never look the same after
this!"
1137,BEN,1137,"Well. Fine. I'll pay for vaginal
reconstructive surgery."
1138,ALISON,1138,"You can't pay for shit! You can barely
buy spaghetti."
1139,BEN,1139,You're right. Fine!
1140,ALISON,1140,You know what? Get out of the car.
1141,BEN,1141,"Oh! You know what? Why don't you not
threaten me?!"
1142,ALISON,1142,"You should just get out of the fucking
car."
1143,BEN,1143,"I'm not going to get out of the car in
the middle of nowhere! No!"
1144,ALISON,1144,Get out of the car.
1145,BEN,1145,No!
1146,ALISON,1146,I own this car! Get out of my car!
1147,BEN,1147,No.
1148,ALISON,1148,Get out of my car!
1149,BEN,1149,No.
1150,"ALISON
(YELLING)",1150,Get out of my fucking car!
1151,"ALISON
(YELLING)",1151,KNOCKED UP - 93.
1152,BEN,1152,"Can you let me back in the car,
please? Have you calmed down? Did you
take a breath? I have no clue where we
are!"
1153,BEN (CONT'D),1153,Fine. Go. Great.
1154,ALISON,1154,"You know what? Maybe I should take my
shoes off. Or my belt buckle. My belt
buckle's huge.
DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
Don't worry about gaining weight. Your
baby wants you to gain a whole mess of
weight."
1155,"ALISON
(TO BEN)",1155,Are you fucking kidding me?
1156,BEN,1156,"Why don't you take off your earrings,
too? They weigh about eighty pounds.
They're made out of moon rocks aren't
they?"
1157,ALISON,1157,"Do not make fun of me. Okay? I am
hormonal, I am terrified, and I am
falling apart, so stop treating
everything like it's a big joke!"
1158,BEN,1158,"I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I
just walked three fucking miles
through Koreatown to get here. Sorry
if I'm trying to lighten the mood a
little."
1159,ALISON,1159,"Well, don't! Okay?! You can't take
anything seriously! You didn't even
read the baby books."
1160,BEN,1160,"I didn't read the baby books! What's
gonna happen? How did anyone ever give
birth without a baby book?!"
1161,(MORE),1161,KNOCKED UP - 94.
1162,BEN (CONT'D),1162,"That's right, the ancient Egyptians
fucking engraved ""What to Expect When
You're Expecting"" on the pyramid
walls! I forgot about that! Who gives
a flying fuck about the baby books?!"
1163,ALISON,1163,"It just shows your lack of commitment,
Ben! That you're not in this with me!"
1164,BEN,1164,"Did you just say my lack of
commitment? Because that's what it
sounded like. It almost seems as
though you forgot I proposed to you
like an asshole! And you said no to
me!"
1165,ALISON,1165,"If you feel that way, you should just
go. Really. Just go. Because we didn't
mean to do this together, okay? And,
and we tried to make it work and that
was good, I suppose."
1166,ALISON (CONT'D),1166,"But it doesn't work. Because we are
two completely different people. And I
think it would just be easier for both
of us if we stop fooling ourselves."
1167,BEN,1167,"You know what? I know this isn't you
talking, it's your hormones, but I
would just like to say, ""Fuck you,
hormones! You are a crazy bitch,
hormones! Not Alison! Hormones!"" Fuck
them. It's a girl. Buy some pink shit!"
1168,ALISON,1168,"Nice. You are such an asshole. You
know what? Go fuck your fucking bong,
you fuck!"
1169,BEN,1169,"I will fuck my bong. Doggie-style, for
once."
1170,BEN,1170,"DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
Are you ready?"
1171,ALISON,1171,"I'm really sorry about all that. That
was really inappropriate.
DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
That's okay. It happens all the time
here. It's fine.
KNOCKED UP - 95."
1172,ALISON,1172,"I don't feel so stupid, then.
DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
Not at all."
1173,BEN,1173,"I totally know what you're talking
about, man. If I wrote out the list of
shit Alison doesn't let me do it would
be endless. Don't smoke pot. Don't
have samurai swords in your room.
Don't have illegal grow operations in
the house. I could go on all fucking
day. Have I told her to stop doing
anything ever? No."
1174,PETE,1174,"Marriage is like that show ""Everybody
Loves Raymond,"" but it's not funny.
All the problems are the same, but
it's... Instead of all the funny,
pithy dialogue, everybody's just
really pissed off and tense. Marriage
is like an unfunny, tense version of
""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" but it
doesn't last twenty-two minutes. It
lasts forever."
1175,BEN,1175,"Let's get out of here, man. Honestly,
let's just go. Let's go to Vegas."
1176,PETE,1176,Let's do it.
1177,BEN,1177,Yeah.
1178,PETE,1178,Why not?
1179,DEBBIE,1179,Get up.
1180,ALISON,1180,"What?
KNOCKED UP - 96."
1181,DEBBIE,1181,We're not going to do this. Seriously.
1182,ALISON,1182,What are you doing?
1183,DEBBIE,1183,We have to do something! And have fun!
1184,ALISON,1184,I'm just so tired.
1185,DEBBIE,1185,"I know you're tired. But we're going
to be untired! We're going to go live!"
1186,ALISON,1186,Ugh. I hate you so much sometimes.
1187,DEBBIE,1187,We're going to be positive.
1188,ALISON,1188,How many Red Bulls have you had?
1189,DEBBIE,1189,"I've had about three Red Bulls in the
last fifteen minutes. And I feel
fabulous! We're going to create a new
life and it's going to be awesome!
Let's go!"
1190,BEN,1190,"Since when do we lock this fucking
thing? Come on!"
1191,JASON,1191,"Yo. We can't go, dude. Sorry."
1192,BEN,1192,Holy crap! What happened?
1193,JONAH,1193,We got pink eye.
1194,BEN,1194,"What? You giving each other butterfly
kisses or something?"
1195,JASON,1195,"Very funny. That's not how you get
pink eye. You get it from poo
particles making their way into your
ocular cavities.
KNOCKED UP - 97."
1196,JAY,1196,"Hey, Ben."
1197,BEN,1197,Yo.
1198,JAY,1198,"How's it going? I farted on Jason's
pillow as a practical joke. He farted
on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And
then eventually pink-eyes my pillow.
I'm not proud of this. But, I think
we've all forgiven each other. But, we
can't go anywhere."
1199,PETE,1199,"You can get pink eye from farting in a
pillow?"
1200,JONAH,1200,Totally.
1201,PETE,1201,That's awesome.
1202,JONAH,1202,"Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed."
1203,BEN,1203,"Jesus. Martin got it bad! What, did
someone take a dump right in your eye?"
1204,MARTIN,1204,"No. No pink eye for me. I'm just
really...high."
1205,BEN,1205,"Well stay back, guys. I got to get my
suit."
1206,"JASON
(TO PETE)",1206,Are you Debbie's husband?
1207,PETE,1207,Yeah.
1208,BEN,1208,"This is fun!
KNOCKED UP - 98."
1209,PETE,1209,"This is great. We're going to have the
best time ever."
1210,BEN,1210,"We make a good team, man."
1211,PETE,1211,"Yep. It's like I can't come here with
Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's
like she wants to hold me in, and she
was telling Alison she could train
you."
1212,BEN,1212,She thinks she could train me?
1213,PETE,1213,"Yeah, like you're running the Triple
Crown."
1214,BEN,1214,"She can't train this! I'm like
Siegfried and Roy's Bengal. You think
I'm trained. I'll bite your fucking
face off."
1215,PETE,1215,That's right.
1216,BEN,1216,"In front of a crowd, baby."
1217,PETE,1217,"This is better. Besides I don't know
if I have enough of these babies to go
around."
1218,BEN,1218,"Oh, my God. Are these mushrooms?"
1219,PETE,1219,"I got them from a roadie for the Black
Crowes."
1220,BEN,1220,I'm eating them.
1221,PETE,1221,"Oh, no, save it! I got tickets to
Cirque du Soleil."
1222,BEN,1222,You do?! No you don't.
1223,PETE,1223,"I swear to God, man."
1224,BEN,1224,Holy shit!
1225,PETE,1225,"I see the beam of light.
KNOCKED UP - 99."
1226,BEN,1226,"There it is, baby."
1227,PETE,1227,"Woo-hoo. You're so money that you
don't even know how much money you
have."
1228,BEN,1228,"I love Vegas, man."
1229,PETE,1229,This is the greatest place on earth.
1230,BEN,1230,It's really amazing here.
1231,PETE,1231,Whoa. You got my tie. This is awesome.
1232,BEN,1232,Now that's how you get pink eye.
1233,DOORMAN,1233,"(to the Two Pretty Girls)
Hey, what's up, baby girl?"
1234,DEBBIE,1234,Hi.
1235,DOORMAN,1235,"What's up? End of the line, please."
1236,DEBBIE,1236,Really?
1237,DOORMAN,1237,Yeah.
1238,DEBBIE,1238,"Oh, come on."
1239,DOORMAN,1239,"Look, we're at capacity, okay? We'll
let some people in when it clears out
a little. You'll get right in if you
go back to the end of the line.
KNOCKED UP - 100."
1240,DEBBIE,1240,"We come here all the time. It's not a
big deal. It doesn't really look that
crowded in there."
1241,DOORMAN,1241,"Hey, look, I don't make the rules."
1242,DEBBIE,1242,Please?
1243,DOORMAN,1243,No.
1244,DOORMAN (CONT'D),1244,"Hey, what's up, shorty? What's up
pretty girls? See y'all when y'all get
out. Take care of yourself."
1245,DEBBIE,1245,What was that? What the fuck was that?
1246,DOORMAN,1246,"It is what it is, sweetie. Now can you
step to the back, please?"
1247,"ALISON
(TO DEBBIE)",1247,"You know what? Maybe we should just
go."
1248,DEBBIE,1248,You don't need to call me sweetie.
1249,DOORMAN,1249,"Yeah, but maybe you should listen to
your friend."
1250,DEBBIE,1250,"No, you don't need to call me sweetie."
1251,DOORMAN,1251,"All right, you want to come in, you're
going to have to go to the end of the
line and wait like everybody else."
1252,DEBBIE,1252,"I'm not going to go to the end of the
fucking line. Who the fuck are you? I
have just as much of a right to be
here as any of these little skanky
girls! What, am I not skanky enough
for you?! You want me to hike up my
fucking skirt?! What the fuck is your
problem?! I'm not going anywhere!
You're just some `roided out freak
with a fucking clipboard. And your
stupid little fucking rope! You may
have power now, but you're not God.
You're a doorman! Okay? You're a
doorman! So...fuck you, you fucking
fag with your fucking little faggy
gloves.
KNOCKED UP - 101."
1253,DOORMAN,1253,"Come here, come on."
1254,"DOORMAN
(WHISPERING)",1254,"I know. You're right. I'm so sorry. I
fucking hate this job. I don't want to
be the one to pass judgement and
decide who gets in. This shit makes me
sick to my stomach. I get the runs
from the stress. It's not because
you're not hot. I would love to tap
that ass. I would tear that ass up. I
can't let you in because you're old as
fuck...for this club, not, you know,
for the earth."
1255,DEBBIE,1255,What?
1256,DOORMAN,1256,"You old. She pregnant. Can't have a
bunch of old, pregnant bitches running
around. That's crazy. I'm only allowed
to let in five percent black people.
He said that. Five percent. That mean
if there's twenty-five people here, I
get to let in one-and-a-quarter black
people. So I got to hope there's a
black midget in the crowd."
1257,DEBBIE,1257,Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.
1258,DOORMAN,1258,"Why y'all want to be in here anyway?
Y'all need to be at a yoga class or
something."
1259,(REGARDING ALISON),1259,"What the fuck is she doing at the
club? That's not even good parenting
right there. Your old ass should know
better than that."

my life."
1266,BEN,1266,"What are they going to do? What in the
world are they doing? If I shaved my
stomach and my chest, I would look
exactly like that. Those guys are at
work right now.

my brother."

1276,DEBBIE,1276,My youth.
1277,ALISON,1277,Don't say that.
1278,DEBBIE,1278,"It's true. I just want to dance. I
love dancing."
1279,ALISON,1279,So dance.
1280,DEBBIE,1280,I can't dance. I'm embarrassed.
1281,ALISON,1281,"I should be embarrassed. I'm a fucking
whale and I'm trying to get into some
stupid club and--"
1282,DEBBIE,1282,"You look beautiful. You're young and
you're tall and you got the good lips
and boobs. I'm going to be alone."
1283,ALISON,1283,"Debbie, no, you're not."
1284,DEBBIE,1284,"Yes, I am. Oh, God! Fucking, men! I
get worse looking and he gets better
looking, and it's so fucking unfair.
Oh, fuck. We should go. My babysitter
always gets mad when we come home past
twelve. She's such a pissy little high-
school cunt."

come on! Jessica, can you get these
plates and put them on the table,
please?!

kids. It's not funny. This is sick.
This is a sick movie. That's a lot of
responsibility to be joking about.
That's not funny. I got to turn this
off. It's freaking me out."
1287,PETE,1287,"There are five different types of
chairs in this hotel room."

here?"

chair."
1290,BEN,1290,"Get them out of here, man. This is too
many chairs for one room."
1291,PETE,1291,"There's a guy that works for this
hotel. His whole job is to find
chairs."
1292,PETE (CONT'D),1292,"Look at this one. Look at it. It's
gold and red and it's kind of shiny.
Shiny thread? Unbelievable. It is
beautiful, and it feels amazing."

short one's being very droll. I don't
like them."

you're not sitting on them."

wonder how somebody could even like
you?"

wonder how you like me."
1305,PETE,1305,"How can Debbie like me? She likes me.
I mean, she loves me. The biggest
problem in our marriage is that she
wants me around. She loves me so much
that she wants me around all the time.
That's our biggest problem. And I
can't even accept that? Uh, like that
upsets me?!"

accept Debbie? She's chosen to give
you her life. She's picked you as her
life partner! But you play fantasy
baseball because you can't accept her
love?"
1316,BEN (CONT'D),1316,"Ugh. I could accept it, man. And
Debbie's amazing, man. She's cool and
she's funny and she smells good and
she's nice and her hair always looks
different. She's too good for you,

And she busts your balls because
you're a little bitch! You're a filthy
bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie
wants to give her life to you and

me. And it makes me sad all day. I
want to go home."

they been saying?"
1330,SADIE,1330,"They've been saying, like ""blah-blah-
blah-blah. Ben's a prick."""
1331,BEN,1331,They said that?
1332,SADIE,1332,A lot.
1333,BEN,1333,That sucks.
1334,SADIE,1334,What does it mean?
1335,BEN,1335,Penis. It means penis.

yellow and pink cupcakes?"
1347,PETE,1347,I just got yellow cupcakes.
1348,DEBBIE,1348,I thought I said to get pink cupcakes.
1349,PETE,1349,I can run out. I'll get some more.
1350,DEBBIE,1350,"Nah, it's no big deal."
1351,PETE,1351,I don't mind.
1352,DEBBIE,1352,No it doesn't matter.
1353,PETE,1353,You sure?
1354,DEBBIE,1354,Yeah. You look really cute in that.
1355,BEN,1355,"Well, that was fast, you pussy."

party."

Palace?

1361,BEN,1361,"Yeah, I was about to."
1362,PETE,1362,Right on.
1363,BEN,1363,It's a doll.
1364,PETE,1364,"Thanks, Ben."
1365,ALISON,1365,"I just don't think we can make it
work."

everything's going to be great."
1367,ALISON,1367,"You're just being nice. And I'm being
nice and just because we're two nice
people doesn't mean we should stay
together. I don't want this baby to
determine the rest of our lives. You
know? Me not wanting to do this alone
isn't enough of a reason to drag you
into a relationship with me. It's just
not fair. And, and don't repeat this,
but, God, I don't want to end up like
Debbie."
1368,BEN,1368,But Debbie's happy.
1369,ALISON,1369,"She's happy today. But every day is a
constant struggle for them because
they're not right for each other. You
know? And they have to force it and I
don't want us to have to do that. I
don't want to force you to be what I
think you should be. That's wrong of
me because you're great. You really
are. You're great the way you are and,
I mean, you like to get high and you
like to do shrooms in Vegas.

1370,BEN,1370,I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.
1371,ALISON,1371,"And who am I to stop you? Who am I to
tell you that that's wrong? It's not
wrong. It's who you are. It's what you
enjoy and that's your life and..."
1372,BEN,1372,I'm not that guy anymore.
1373,ALISON,1373,"We can be friends. And you can be
there when the baby is born, and in
the baby's life as much as you want. I
hope you will be."
1374,BEN,1374,"If you give me a shot to just show you
that I'm con--"
1375,DEBBIE,1375,Excuse me?
1376,BEN,1376,"Oh, shit."
1377,"DEBBIE
(TO ALISON)",1377,"Can you grab the video camera? We're
going to sing ""Happy Birthday"" now."
1378,ALISON,1378,Yeah.
1379,(TO BEN),1379,I'm sorry. I got to go. I'm sorry.
1380,BEN,1380,It's okay.
1381,ALISON,1381,"I'll be right back. We'll finish
talking."
1382,PETE,1382,What happened?
1383,BEN,1383,"Thanks for warning me, man. I just
walking into a fucking buzz saw! She
rejected me! Because you, for some
insane reason, told Debbie that I did
mushrooms with you in Vegas! She gets
mad because I smoke pot!"
1384,(MORE),1384,KNOCKED UP - 111.
1385,BEN (CONT'D),1385,"Now I'm upping it to fucking
psychedelics! Thanks!"
1386,PETE,1386,"Really? I thought that she'd take you
back."
1387,BEN,1387,"You know why she just rejected me?
Because you're such a shitty husband,
she thinks I'm going to turn into a
shitty husband!"
1388,"PETE
(SINGING)",1388,"""Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday
to you."""
1389,JESSICA ALBA,1389,When are you due?
1390,ALISON,1390,I got two months.
1391,JESSICA ALBA,1391,"Really? Wow. Well, you're so big
already."
1392,ALISON,1392,Yeah.
1393,ANDY DICK,1393,When is that baby popping out?
1394,ALISON,1394,I got two months to go.
1395,ANDY DICK,1395,Really? Are you dilated yet?
1396,ALISON,1396,"Wow, wow."
1397,EVA MENDES,1397,You look fantastic.
1398,ALISON,1398,"Thanks, thanks.
KNOCKED UP - 112."
1399,EVA MENDES,1399,"Are you going to, like, give birth
right now?"
1400,STEVE CARELL,1400,Wow! You're about to drop any second.
1401,ALISON,1401,You know what?
1402,STEVE CARELL,1402,I love your broach here.
1403,ALISON,1403,"You don't need to lie to me. I don't
appreciate it. I know I look like a
fat cow. And I'm sweating profusely."
1404,STEVE CARELL,1404,"No, you don't look like a...fat cow at
all. You look great. So, I have to get
going in. They're calling me."
1405,ALISON,1405,"Steve, hey! Help me out. Give me an
interview, please."
1406,STEVE CARELL,1406,"Well, I just need to run in."
1407,ALISON,1407,"You know what? Just say into the
camera, ""You're watching E!
Entertainment."" Just give me that."
1408,STEVE CARELL,1408,Congratulations.
1409,ALISON,1409,"No, Steve, don't be an asshole! Come
on."
1410,STEVE CARELL,1410,I'm not being an asshole.
1411,BRENT,1411,"Wow. You managed to turn Steve Carell
into an asshole. No easy feat."
1412,ALISON,1412,"Shut up, Brent.
KNOCKED UP - 113."
1413,BEN,1413,"You screwed me, Dad, okay? You said
everything was going to be fine and
nothing is fine. Nothing is fine.
HARRIS (O.S.)
Ben, I've been divorced three times.
Why would you listen to me?"
1414,BEN,1414,"Because you were the only one giving
me advice! And it was, it was terrible
advice!
HARRIS (O.S.)
You can go around blaming everyone
else, but in the end, until you take
responsibility for yourself, none of
this is going to work out."
1415,BEN,1415,"I don't know how to take
responsibility for myself, okay? I
didn't read the baby books!
HARRIS (O.S.)
You didn't read the books?"
1416,BEN,1416,"I should smoke less pot. I don't know
what to do! I'm an idiot! What, tell
me what to do!
HARRIS (O.S.)
I don't know. I don't know. Ben, I
love ya. What can I tell ya?"
1417,BEN,1417,Just tell me what to do.
1418,BOSS,1418,"Stone, you settling in okay?"
1419,BEN,1419,Best job I ever had.
1420,BOSS,1420,Like to hear it.
1421,BOSS,1421,KNOCKED UP - 114.
1422,JACK,1422,"Alison, thank you for coming in. I
don't want to shock you, but know
what's under that jacket. You're
pregnant, have been for a while. From
my count, you're right around eight
months. And I don't know why you felt
you couldn't tell us."
1423,ALISON,1423,I'm really sorry.
1424,JILL,1424,"This is Hollywood. We don't like
liars."
1425,ALISON,1425,"I just wasn't expecting this and, I
didn't know how to handle it, and I
didn't want to lose my job. I'm really
sorry."
1426,JACK,1426,"It's unfortunate that you didn't tell
us because you would've found out that
we thought it's great.
KNOCKED UP - 115."
1427,JILL,1427,KNOCKED UP - 116.
1428,ALISON,1428,Okay. I won't. I'm sorry.
1429,JILL,1429,I just don't like secrets.
1430,PETE,1430,"You know, it's a rare thing that you
live to see the day your wildest
dreams come true. I mean what is there
left to want? I get to go to Legoland."
1431,DEBBIE,1431,"Shut up, Pete."
1432,PETE,1432,Say it!
1433,ALISON,1433,Legoland!

drive."
1435,PETE,1435,"I shouldn't have given them all that
meth then."
1436,DEBBIE,1436,We'll be back on Sunday.
1437,PETE,1437,"Or Saturday. You never know. We might
see it all in one day."
1438,DEBBIE,1438,Sunday. Let's go.
1439,ALISON,1439,"Ow, ow, ow."
1440,BEN,1440,"Hello?
KNOCKED UP - 117."
1441,JASON,1441,"Hey, what's up daddy? What are you
doing?"
1442,BEN,1442,"Just smoking a joint, drinking some
beers, you know. Rocking."
1443,JASON,1443,"I think we're about to go to a new
club. You coming?"
1444,BEN,1444,No. I'm going to pack it in soon.
1445,"JONAH
(TO JASON)",1445,What's he doing?
1446,"JASON
(TO JONAH)",1446,He says he's going to call it a night.
1447,(TO BEN),1447,"Dude, it's like eight-fifteen, man."
1448,BEN,1448,I know. I'm just tired.
1449,"JONAH
(TO JASON)",1449,Is he depressed?
1450,"JASON
(TO BEN)",1450,You depressed?
1451,BEN,1451,"No, I feel great. I like it."
1452,"JASON
(TO JONAH)",1452,He says no.
1453,"JONAH
(TO JASON)",1453,Ask him if he's going to kill himself.
1454,"JASON
(TO BEN)",1454,You going to kill yourself?
1455,BEN,1455,"No, I'm not. Okay? Thank you.
KNOCKED UP - 118."
1456,"JONAH
(TO JASON)",1456,"Tell him not to jerk off with a noose
around his neck. It's dangerous."
1457,"JASON
(TO BEN)",1457,"You shouldn't jerk off with a noose
around your neck because it's
dangerous."
1458,BEN,1458,"Okay, very good."
1459,"JONAH
(TO JASON)",1459,"Oh, and tell him if he has to, tell
him he needs a teammate or a spotter
there."
1460,"JASON
(TO BEN)",1460,"Right. And if you do, um, you should
have a teammate or a spotter there."
1461,BEN,1461,Great.
1462,"JASON
(TO JONAH)",1462,He says your mom's already there.
1463,JONAH,1463,"That's cool, man."
1464,"ALISON
(TO HERSELF)",1464,"Okay, okay, okay.
(into the phone)
Hi, Dr. Howard?"
1465,"ALISON
(TO HERSELF)",1465,"DR. ANGELO
No, this is Dr. Angelo. How can I help
you?"
1466,ALISON,1466,"I'm a patient of Dr. Howard's and I'm
going into labor and I need to speak
with him.
KNOCKED UP - 119."
1467,ALISON,1467,"DR. ANGELO
I actually don't know where he is
tonight. But I've made myself
available to his patients and I'd be
happy to help you."
1468,ALISON,1468,"Can you help me find him? Can you give
me his number?
DR. ANGELO
Oh, no. You know what? Actually, I'm
under strict instructions not give out
his number, but I can help you through
this."
1469,ALISON,1469,"No, no, no, no. I want to speak to my
own doctor. You really won't give me
his number? Because this is my first
baby and he promised that he would be
here for me and I need you to give me
his number, okay?
DR. ANGELO
Dr. Howard is not available tonight.
Bet everything's going to be okay, I
assure you."
1470,ALISON,1470,"No, I don't want you to help me
because I have no idea who you are! I
want my own goddamned doctor! You make
sure he calls me!"
1471,"ALISON (CONT'D)
(TO HERSELF)",1471,"Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, shit."
1472,BEN,1472,Hello?
1473,"BEN
(TO CAR)",1473,"Oh, don't run out of gas! Don't run
out of gas! Come on!
KNOCKED UP - 120."
1474,BEN,1474,Hello?
1475,BEN,1475,Please be in here. Hello? Hello!
1476,BEN,1476,Hello? Alison. Hello?
1477,ALISON,1477,Ben?
1478,BEN,1478,"Alison. What is this, like a water
birth? What are we doing? Should we
go?"
1479,ALISON,1479,"Shh! Just relax, okay? Just be mellow,
because that's what this is all about.
Because if it gets too stressful in
here then the baby is born into a
stressful environment and then he's
wired for stress for the rest of his
life. So just...just be calm."
1480,"BEN
(WHISPERING)",1480,"Okay. Okay. Let's relax. Do you want
to talk about things? I feel really
bad about a lot of the shit I did. I
can't believe I said some of that.
That's all I think about in my head."
1481,"IT--
ALISON",1481,I don't want to talk about it.
1482,BEN,1482,"But maybe we could bring the baby into
a reconciled place so, we can talk--
KNOCKED UP - 121."
1483,ALISON,1483,"No. I don't want to go there. Don't go
there, okay?"
1484,BEN,1484,Okay.
1485,ALISON,1485,Help me stay relaxed.
1486,BEN,1486,"So, what should I do?"
1487,ALISON,1487,You need to call Dr. Howard.
1488,MARIA,1488,Hello?
1489,BEN,1489,"Hello, this is Ben Stone. I'm calling
on behalf of Alison Scott. We need Dr.
Howard. It's an emergency."
1490,MARIA,1490,He's at San Francisco at Bar Mitzvah.
1491,BEN,1491,"He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San
Francisco? Do you know when he gets
back?"
1492,MARIA,1492,In three days.
1493,BEN,1493,"Do you have his cell number, by any
chance?"
1494,"BEN (CONT'D)
(TO ALISON)",1494,"Hey! Good news. I got his number right
here. I'm going to call him right now."
1495,ALISON,1495,"Great. Thank you so much. I'm so glad
you're here. Thank you.
KNOCKED UP - 122."
1496,BEN,1496,"I'm glad I'm here, too. Thank you. I
shouldn't have told you you were a
fucking lunatic. I shouldn't have said
that. I feel terrible about it."
1497,ALISON,1497,"No, it's okay. We're past it. I'm
sorry I told you to fuck your bong."
1498,BEN,1498,It's okay. I didn't
1499,ALISON,1499,Let's just drop it now. We're over it.
1500,BEN,1500,"I'm going to call him right now.
You're doing so great."
1501,BEN,1501,"DR. HOWARD (O.S.)
Hello, it's Dr. Howard. I'm not here
right now. Please leave a message."
1502,BEN,1502,"(into the phone)
Hey, Doc Howard. Ben Stone calling.
Guess what the fuck's up? Alison's
going into labor and you are not
fucking here. Now, where are you?
You're at a fucking Bar Mitzvah in San
Francisco, you motherfucking piece of
shit! And you know I'm going to have
to do now? I'm going to have to kill
you. I'm going to have to pop a cap in
your ass. You're dead! You're Tupac!
You are fucking Biggie, you piece of
shit! I hope you fucking die or drop
the fucking chair and kill that
fucking kid! Hope your plane crashes.
Peace, fucker!"
1503,ALISON,1503,Hey.
1504,BEN,1504,Hey.
1505,ALISON,1505,Did you talk to him?
1506,BEN,1506,"I didn't talk to him directly, I left
him a very nice message, though. What
I'm about to tell you isn't that bad.
You should know that going in. We can
get through this and it's just a
little hiccup, but everything will be
fine. Do you trust me when I say
everything will be fine?
KNOCKED UP - 123."
1507,BEN,1507,KNOCKED UP - 124.
1508,ALISON,1508,Thank you.
1509,BEN,1509,You're welcome.
1510,ALISON,1510,Wait. Are we allowed to park here?
1511,BEN,1511,It's okay.
1512,BEN (CONT'D),1512,I stole this from Martin's grandma.
1513,ALISON,1513,Oh. That was really sweet of you.
1514,BEN,1514,Thanks.
1515,"BEN
(TO ALISON)",1515,"We're close. Home stretch.
(to Female Nurse)
Hello. This is Alison Scott. Dr. Kuni
said he would let you know we were
coming?"
1516,FEMALE NURSE,1516,"He did. We'll take good care of you.
Samuel?"
1517,SAMUEL,1517,Yeah?
1518,FEMALE NURSE,1518,"This is Alison Scott. Please admit her
into room 307."
1519,SAMUEL,1519,All right. Hi.
1520,BEN,1520,You're our nurse?
1521,SAMUEL,1521,"That's why I'm holding the clipboard.
So, uh, what else is up with you guys?
KNOCKED UP - 125."
1522,SAMUEL (CONT'D),1522,I'm just joking. Let's have a baby!
1523,SAMUEL,1523,"So, I'm sorry it took me so long to
find that vein. That little guy really
didn't want me to find him."
1524,ALISON,1524,"Is that the baby on that one right
there?"
1525,SAMUEL,1525,"Yeah. That's how we can tell how the
little guy or gal is doing."
1526,ALISON,1526,Okay.
1527,ALISON,1527,"DR. KUNI
Hello, Alison, Ben. Interesting night."
1528,BEN,1528,"We really, really appreciate you
coming, man.
DR. KUNI
What else do I have to do, I mean,
besides sleep? I was only kidding.
What happened to your doctor?"
1529,BEN,1529,"He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San
Francisco. He didn't tell us though.
DR. KUNI
Nice."
1530,BEN,1530,"Yeah.
DR. KUNI
Lucky for you I don't have any Jewish
friends."
1531,ALISON,1531,"Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this
naturally. I don't want to use drugs.
DR. KUNI
Let's just take a look and see what
happens, okay? Fetal heart rate is
good. Samuel, where are we?
KNOCKED UP - 126."
1532,SAMUEL,1532,"Four centimeters.
DR. KUNI
Four centimeters what?"
1533,SAMUEL,1533,"Dilated.
DR. KUNI
Dilated. That's right. Focus. Pay
attention, okay? We're a team. Okay?"
1534,JONAH,1534,I want to get the fuck out of here.
1535,JAY,1535,What?
1536,JONAH,1536,"I just want to get the fuck out of
here."
1537,JAY,1537,"Just relax, man, just relax."
1538,JONAH,1538,I don't fucking like hospitals.
1539,JAY,1539,"Jonah, this is beautiful. I just think
you need to relax and embrace the
beauty of another life joining our
gang. We're having a baby. We are
having a baby."
1540,JONAH,1540,"I'm not having shit besides a fucking
panic attack. There's probably a
fucking room back there full of dead
bodies! You guys want to be here when
one rolls out and just fucking coughs
malaria into our face?"
1541,JAY,1541,Jesus.
1542,JONAH,1542,Fucking shit.
1543,BEN,1543,"Is that good?
KNOCKED UP - 127."
1544,ALISON,1544,"Oh, yeah, get in there."
1545,BEN,1545,I could do this all day.
1546,ALISON,1546,What was that?
1547,BEN,1547,What the hell was that?
1548,BEN (CONT'D),1548,"What's that, what's happening?"
1549,BEN (CONT'D),1549,"DR. KUNI
Well, boy and girls, what seems to be
the problem?"
1550,SAMUEL,1550,"Decels.
DR. KUNI
Oh, dear. Okay. Alison, I need you to
turn on your back now, okay? The
baby's heart rate is slowing. Okay?"
1551,BEN,1551,"It's going to be okay.
(to Dr. Kuni)
Is it going to be fine?"
1552,BEN,1552,"DR. KUNI
It's going to be fine. Okay?"
1553,(TO ALISON),1553,"You're going to feel a little bit of a
push."
1554,BEN,1554,"What are you doing?
DR. KUNI
I'm turning the baby so I can take the
pressure off the cord."
1555,ALISON,1555,"Oh, my God."
1556,ALISON,1556,"KNOCKED UP - 128.
DR. KUNI
We're good. The heartbeat's stronger,
but we're not out of the woods. We
need to get things going now. I think
the cord is wrapped around the neck.
Okay?"
1557,BEN,1557,"What?
DR. KUNI
So I'm going to give you some
medicine, pop the bag and get things
going, okay? I don't want to leave the
baby in there for long and we can give
you some medicine for the pain."
1558,ALISON,1558,"No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby
to be born all drugged out. It's not
my birth plan.
DR. KUNI
Now, things change. We don't have time
to debate this."
1559,ALISON,1559,"What? No. But no, I'm not comfortable
with that. I'm not."
1560,BEN,1560,"No. Would you please just listen to
her?
DR. KUNI
Fine. Do what you want to do."
1561,BEN,1561,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
DR. KUNI
Should I leave? Do you want to be the
doctor? Because I really don't need to
be here."
1562,BEN,1562,"No. What we want is to take a second
to talk about our options, okay?
That's all we want.
DR. KUNI
No. You mean you want to take a second
to tell me how to do my job. My job is
to get that baby out safely. Or I can
go home! You just let me know. You be
the doctor."
1563,BEN,1563,"Can we talk outside in the hall for a
second?"
1564,BEN,1564,"KNOCKED UP - 129.
DR. KUNI
That woman is a control freak, and she
needs to let go and let me do my job."
1565,BEN,1565,"Look, she's just having a hard time
because her and her doctor had a very
specific birth plan. And they wanted
it to be a very special experience.
DR. KUNI
Okay. if you want a special
experience, go to a Jimmy Buffet
concert. We have a new birth plan: Get
the baby out safely."
1566,BEN,1566,"Look, man, will you help us out? I
have no idea what I'm doing. You can
be as big a dick to me as you want.
Just be nice to her, man. That's all I
ask. Just please be nice to her."
1567,BEN,1567,"DR. KUNI
Are you okay?"
1568,BEN,1568,"I think so.
DR. KUNI
I'm sorry. Let's start fresh."
1569,BEN,1569,"Thank you, man.
DR. KUNI
This is healthy. This is good. I think
we're bonding."
1570,BEN,1570,"DR. KUNI
Alison, I apologize for being a little
brash, but if you're okay with it,
it's rather important we break the bag
and give you some medicine to speed
things up. Because once the bag is
broken, I don't want there to be an
infection."
1571,ALISON,1571,Whatever. Do what you have to do.
1572,ALISON (CONT'D),1572,"(whispering to Ben)
Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy
is.
KNOCKED UP - 130."
1573,BEN,1573,"I know, I know. Look, I talked to him.
I think he'll be more cool now."
1574,ALISON,1574,I'm so sorry I broke up with you.
1575,BEN,1575,"You really don't need to be. And you
know, I knew you'd give me another
shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner
than this, you know?"
1576,ALISON,1576,"I was just in such a panic from all of
this. And watching Debbie and Pete
together, and my ass got so fat."
1577,BEN,1577,"No, no."
1578,ALISON,1578,"It did. I just never, for one minute,
thought that the guy who got me
pregnant would actually be the right
guy for me."
1579,BEN,1579,Me neither.
1580,ALISON,1580,I guess he is.
1581,JONAH,1581,"All right, Martin, who am I?"
1582,"(IMPERSONATING STEPHEN

in a robot voice."
1583,MARTIN,1583,Stephen Hawking.
1584,"JONAH

cock."
1585,(STOPS IMPERSONATION),1585,"All right. Let's murderball. Come
here! I'm going to murderball you!"
1586,MARTIN,1586,"Oh, fuck.
KNOCKED UP - 131."
1587,JONAH,1587,Stay down!
1588,MARTIN,1588,"Jonah, you shithead!"
1589,DEBBIE,1589,"Hi. I can't believe I go out of town
and this happens."
1590,ALISON,1590,I know.
1591,DEBBIE,1591,"I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere."
1592,ALISON,1592,Screw Legoland.
1593,PETE,1593,"All right, how do you want this? You
want this over the shoulder? I can do
whatever you want. I can get in there.
Kind of Spike Lee angles."
1594,ALISON,1594,"No, you can shoot the waiting room.
That would be great."
1595,"DEBBIE
(TO BEN)",1595,"Well, thank you. I've got it from
here."
1596,ALISON,1596,Debbie.
1597,"BEN
(TO DEBBIE)",1597,"Can I talk to you in the hall for a
second?"
1598,DEBBIE,1598,Why?
1599,BEN,1599,"I'd like to be in there with
Alison...without you."
1600,DEBBIE,1600,"Okay. I understand how you feel, but
this isn't up to you.
KNOCKED UP - 132."
1601,BEN,1601,"Look, Debbie, you are high off your
ass if you think you're coming into
that room. If you take one step
towards that door, I will tell
security there's a crazy chick in a
pink dress snatching up babies. Okay?
So don't even try to come into that
room. That's my room now. That little
area with the Pepsi machine...that's
your area. My room. Your area. Stay in
your area. Stay out of my room. Back
the fuck off."
1602,PETE,1602,What are you doing here?
1603,DEBBIE,1603,"He just kicked me out. He told me to
leave. But I guess it's good, right?
He said he's going to take care of
her. He really seems on his game. I
think he's going to be a good dad. I
think I like him. Thank God."
1604,PETE,1604,I wish I'd gotten that on tape.
1605,ALISON,1605,"Go! Holy shit, almighty! Oh, shit,
this really hurts!
DR. KUNI
Ah, I see we're well on our way."
1606,ALISON,1606,"I want the epidural! Okay? Give me the
epidural!"
1607,BEN,1607,"Give it to her. Give her the epidural,
okay?"
1608,ALISON,1608,Okay?
1609,BEN,1609,"Give it to her now.
DR. KUNI
Alison, we're past the point of an
epidural. The cervix is fully dilated.
KNOCKED UP - 133."
1610,ALISON,1610,"No, seriously, I want an epidural! I
know there's time!
DR. KUNI
We can't give you the epidural."
1611,ALISON,1611,"Take the time! I'll make sure it
doesn't come out! I'll stop pushing."
1612,BEN,1612,We have time.
1613,ALISON,1613,"I'll stop, oh, please, please, please!"
1614,BEN,1614,"Just do it, please!
DR. KUNI
I'm sorry. We have no time. We're
going to just have to do this the all
natural way, okay? The way you wanted
to do it. Okay? Ready?"
1615,ALISON,1615,"Okay.
DR. KUNI
Here comes another contraction, okay?
I want you to push. Okay, ready? Good,
good, good."
1616,ALISON,1616,"I feel everything! Oh, my God! It's
happening."
1617,SAMUEL,1617,"Maybe we can take it down just a
little. I think you're going to scare
the other pregnant women."
1618,ALISON,1618,"Are you fucking kidding me? Are you
kidding me?"
1619,JAY,1619,Jesus.
1620,JONAH,1620,"Oh. This is messed up. Something's
wrong in there."
1621,JASON,1621,"No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's
only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to
me like she's crowning. Is that right,
Deb?
KNOCKED UP - 134."
1622,DEBBIE,1622,"Yeah. That's what it sounds like for
everyone. Everyone goes through this."
1623,JAY,1623,"No, I disagree with you. That sounds
terrible. I'm going to go sneak a
peek, see if there's anything I can
do."
1624,JAY,1624,"DR. KUNI
It's crowning! I'm seeing the head!"
1625,ALISON,1625,"Oh, God. Honey, what does it look
like, Ben?"
1626,BEN,1626,"Oh, God."
1627,ALISON,1627,What?
1628,BEN,1628,You don't want to see it. You don't
1629,"WANT--
ALISON",1629,"No, I want to see it!"
1630,BEN,1630,"It's beautiful. You don't want to,
though."
1631,ALISON,1631,"No, I want to see..."
1632,ALISON (CONT'D),1632,"...it! Oh, God! Oh, God!
DR. KUNI
Okay, we're almost home! One, two--"
1633,JAY,1633,"You okay in here?
KNOCKED UP - 135."
1634,JAY (CONT'D),1634,Jesus!
1635,ALISON,1635,Get out!
1636,JAY,1636,"Yeah, okay."
1637,JASON,1637,"You all right, buddy?"
1638,JAY,1638,One sec.
1639,JONAH,1639,What did it look like?
1640,JAY,1640,"I shouldn't have gone in there. Don't
go in there. Promise me you don't go
in there."
1641,JONAH,1641,"Me go in there? That's the last
fucking place I want to go. Like I'm
going to go in there. Try getting a
boner now."
1642,JASON,1642,What's up Deb?
1643,DEBBIE,1643,Hey.
1644,DEBBIE,1644,"DR. KUNI
Push. One, two, three."
1645,ALISON,1645,"Oh, God!
DR. KUNI
You've passed the shoulders. One more
big push. Good."
1646,ALISON,1646,KNOCKED UP - 136.
1647,ALISON,1647,"Oh, Ben. I did it."
1648,BEN,1648,You did it.
1649,ALISON,1649,It's out.
1650,BEN,1650,"You did it. Oh, my God, you did it."
1651,ALISON,1651,"Hi, baby. I love you, Ben."
1652,BEN,1652,"I love you so much, too. Oh, my God.
DR. KUNI
Congratulations, you two. Beautiful."
1653,ALISON,1653,"Thank you.
DR. KUNI
You did so great. You were amazing."
1654,ALISON,1654,Pretty baby.
1655,BEN,1655,You got out. You made it out. Welcome.
1656,MARTIN,1656,"You ever get so bored you just stare
at your balls?"
1657,JONAH,1657,"I bet you do, late John Lennon."
1658,MARTIN,1658,Here we go again.
1659,DEBBIE,1659,"(whispering to Pete)
Who is that? Is that Ben's rabbi? Is
he the one who cuts the penis?"
1660,PETE,1660,I think it's Matisyahu.
1661,MARTIN,1661,Awesome.
1662,JASON,1662,You want out of the bet?
1663,MARTIN,1663,"I want out of the bet.
KNOCKED UP - 137."
1664,JASON,1664,"You know what you have to say. Just
say it, man. I think now is the time."
1665,MARTIN,1665,"""Jason, you're the master."""
1666,JASON,1666,"You heard it, right?"
1667,JAY,1667,Yeah.
1668,JASON,1668,"All right. You're out of the bet.
You're done."
1669,JASON (CONT'D),1669,"Your face smells like an old man's
balls."
1670,MARTIN,1670,Thank you.
1671,DEBBIE,1671,"Oh, my God. Hello. My goodness. She's
beautiful. She's beautiful. I love
you, Ben."
1672,BEN,1672,"I love you, Debbie."
1673,"DEBBIE
(TO PETE)",1673,We're going to have another baby.
1674,PETE,1674,Okay.
1675,DEBBIE,1675,"Hello, baby."
1676,BEN,1676,"Gentlemen, it's a girl!"
1677,THE GUYS,1677,Ohhhhhhh!
1678,BEN,1678,"Yeah!
KNOCKED UP - 138."
1679,JAY,1679,We got a daughter! Mazel Tov!
1680,JASON,1680,"Congratulations, Daddy!"
1681,JAY,1681,We got a beautiful little girl!
1682,BEN,1682,Let's meet her! She's awesome.
1683,JAY,1683,A beautiful little girl!
1684,JASON,1684,Let's meet her. Aw.
1685,BEN,1685,"(to the baby)
And then your mommy said, ""Just do it,
already,"" which was very confusing to
Daddy. So I listened to the most
literal translation of that and I just
did it, already. What would you do?
Don't tell Mommy, but it was the
smartest thing I ever did, listening
to her, because now you're here. Isn't
that nice? I think it is."
1686,ALISON,1686,"I hope your apartment's big enough for
the three of us."
1687,BEN,1687,"It definitely is. That's why I got one
in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The
only thing is we have to decide if
we're going to be Crips or Bloods
before we get there."
1688,ALISON,1688,"Well, I look good in red.
KNOCKED UP - 139."
1689,BEN,1689,"I look good in blue. The fighting
continues. We could just throw off
everyone and become Latin Kings."
1690,ALISON,1690,Yeah.
1691,BEN,1691,We both look good in gold.
1692,ALISON,1692,"Good choice. I would yell at you about
driving so slow, except the baby's
here."
1693,BEN,1693,"No, these guys can honk all they want.
I ain't going faster than twelve. It
might take us around three hours to
get home, though."
