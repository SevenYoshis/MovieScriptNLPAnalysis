0,CLERK,0,"And how are you today, sir?"
1,MAN,1,"Real good now.  I'm checking in
- Mr. Anderson."
2,CLERK,2,"Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you're
still planning on staying with
us just the night, then?"
3,ANDERSON,3,You bet.
4,NEWS ANCHOR,4,"- whether they will go to summer
camp at all.  Katie Jensen has
more."
5,KATIE,5,"It was supposed to be a project
funded by the city council;  it
was supposed to benefit those
Fargo-Moorehead children who
would otherwise not be able to
afford to attend a lakeshore
summer camp.  But nobody consulted
city controller Stu Jacobson..."
6,WAITRESS,6,Can I warm that up for ya there?
7,ANDERSON,7,You bet.
8,ANDERSON,8,"I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard -"
9,YOUNGER MAN,9,You're Jerry Lundegaard?
10,JERRY,10,"Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -"
11,YOUNGER MAN,11,"Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
What gives, man?"
12,JERRY,12,Shep said 8:30.
13,YOUNGER MAN,13,"We been sitting here an hour.
I've peed three times already."
14,JERRY,14,"I'm sure sorry.  I - Shep told
me 8:30.  It was a mix-up, I
guess."
15,YOUNGER MAN,15,Ya got the car?
16,JERRY,16,"Yah, you bet.  It's in the lot
there.  Brand-new burnt umber
Ciera."
17,YOUNGER MAN,17,"Yeah, okay.  Well, siddown then.
I'm Carl Showalter and this is
my associate Gaear Grimsrud."
18,JERRY,18,"Yah, how ya doin'.  So, uh, we
all set on this thing, then?"
19,YOUNGER MAN,19,"Sure, Jerry, we're all set.  Why
wouldn't we be?"
20,JERRY,20,"Yah, no, I'm sure you are.  Shep
vouched for you and all.  I got
every confidence in you fellas."
21,JERRY,21,"...  So I guess that's it, then.
Here's the keys -"
22,CARL,22,"No, that's not it, Jerry."
23,JERRY,23,Huh?
24,CARL,24,"The new vehicle, plus forty
thousand dollars."
25,JERRY,25,"Yah, but the deal was, the car
first, see, then the forty
thousand, like as if it was the
ransom.  I thought Shep told you -"
26,CARL,26,"Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry."
27,JERRY,27,"Well, okay, it's -"
28,CARL,28,"Except that you were gonna be
here at 7:30."
29,JERRY,29,"Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then."
30,CARL,30,"Yeah, you already said that."
31,JERRY,31,"Yah.  But it's not a whole pay-
in-advance deal.  I give you a
brand-new vehicle in advance and -"
32,CARL,32,"I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry."
33,JERRY,33,Okay.
34,CARL,34,"I'm not gonna sit here and debate.
I will say this though:  what Shep
told us didn't make a whole lot
of sense."
35,JERRY,35,"Oh, no, it's real sound.  It's
all worked out."
36,CARL,36,You want your own wife kidnapped?
37,JERRY,37,Yah.
38,CARL,38,"...  You - my point is, you pay
the ransom - what eighty thousand
bucks? -  I mean, you give us
half the ransom, forty thousand,
you keep half.  It's like robbing
Peter to play Paul, it doesn't
make any -"
39,JERRY,39,"Okay, it's - see, it's not me
payin' the ransom.  The thing is,
my wife, she's wealthy - her dad,
he's real well off.  Now, I'm in
a bit of trouble -"
40,CARL,40,"What kind of trouble are you in,
Jerry?"
41,JERRY,41,"Well, that's, that's, I'm not go
inta, inta - see, I just need
money.  Now, her dad's real
wealthy -"
42,CARL,42,"So why don't you just ask him
for the money?"
43,GRIMSRUD,43,"Or your fucking wife, you know."
44,CARL,44,"Or your fucking wife, Jerry."
45,JERRY,45,"Well, it's all just part of this -
they don't know I need it, see.
Okay, so there's that.  And even
if they did, I wouldn't get it.
So there's that on top, then.  See,
these're personal matters."
46,CARL,46,Personal matters.
47,JERRY,47,"Yah.  Personal matters that
needn't, uh -"
48,CARL,48,"Okay, Jerry.  You're tasking us
to perform this mission, but you,
you won't, uh, you won't - aw,
fuck it, let's take a look at
that Ciera."
49,JERRY,49,Hon?  Got the growshries.
50,VOICE,50,"Thank you, hon.  How's Fargo?"
51,JERRY,51,"Yah, real good."
52,VOICE,52,Dad's here.

58,WADE,58,OOOoooh!
59,JERRY,59,"Is he stayin' for supper, then?"
60,WIFE,60,"Yah, I think so...  Dad, are you
stayin' for supper?"
61,WADE,61,Yah.
62,SCOTTY,62,May I be excused?
63,JERRY,63,"Sure, ya done there?"
64,SCOTTY,64,Uh-huh.  Goin' out.
65,WIFE,65,Where are you going?
66,SCOTTY,66,Just out.  Just McDonald's.
67,JERRY,67,Back at 9:30.
68,SCOTTY,68,Okay.
69,WADE,69,"He just ate.  And he didn't finish.
He's going to McDonald's instead
of finishing here?"
70,WIFE,70,"He sees his friends there.  It's
okay."
71,WADE,71,"It's okay?  McDonald's?  What do
you think they do there?  They
don't drink milkshakes, I assure
you!"
72,WIFE,72,"It's okay, Dad."
73,JERRY,73,"Wade, have ya had a chance to
think about, uh, that deal I was
talkin' about, those forty acres
there on Wayzata?"
74,WADE,74,You told me about it.
75,JERRY,75,"Yah, you said you'd have a think
about it.  I understand it's a
lot of money -"
76,WADE,76,"A heck of a lot.  What'd you
say you were gonna put there?"
77,JERRY,77,A lot.  It's a limited -
78,WADE,78,I know it's a lot.
79,JERRY,79,I mean a parking lot.
80,WADE,80,"Yah, well, seven hundred and
fifty thousand dollars is a lot
- ha ha ha!"
81,JERRY,81,"Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -"
82,WADE,82,"I thought you were gonna show
it to Stan Grossman.  He passes
on this stuff before it gets
kicked up to me."
83,JERRY,83,"Well, you know Stan'll say no
dice.  That's why you pay him.
I'm asking you here, Wade.  This
could work out real good for me
and Jean and Scotty -"
84,WADE,84,"Jean and Scotty never have to
worry."
85,GRIMSRUD,85,Where is Pancakes Hause?
86,CARL,86,What?
87,GRIMSRUD,87,We stop at Pancakes Hause.
88,CARL,88,"What're you, nuts?  We had
pancakes for breakfast.  I gotta
go somewhere I can get a shot
and a beer - and a steak maybe.
Not more fuckin' pancakes.  Come
on."
89,CARL,89,"...  Come on, man.  Okay, here's
an idea.  We'll stop outside of
Brainerd.  I know a place there
we can get laid.  Wuddya think?"
90,GRIMSRUD,90,"I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know."
91,CARL,91,"Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin',
we'll stop for pancakes, then
we'll get laid.  Wuddya think?"
92,CUSTOMER,92,"We sat here right in this room and
went over this and over this!"
93,JERRY,93,"Yah, but that TruCoat -"
94,CUSTOMER,94,"I sat right here and said I didn't
want no TruCoat!"
95,JERRY,95,"Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat,
you don't get it and you get
oxidization problems.  It'll cost
you a heck of lot more'n five
hunnert -"
96,CUSTOMER,96,"You're sittin' here, you're talkin'
in circles!  You're talkin' like
we didn't go over this already!"
97,JERRY,97,"Yah, but this TruCoat -"
98,CUSTOMER,98,"We had us a deal here for nine-
teen-five.  You sat there and
darned if you didn't tell me
you'd get this car, these options,
WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nine-
teen-five!"
99,JERRY,99,"Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -"
100,CUSTOMER,100,"You called me twenty minutes ago
and said you had it!  Ready to
make delivery, ya says!  Come on
down and get it!  And here ya are
and you're wastin' my time and
you're wastin' my wife's time and
I'm payin' nineteen-five for this

101,JERRY,101,"Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss..."
102,JERRY,102,"...  See, they install that TruCoat
at the factory, there's nothin' we
can do, but I'll talk to my boss."
103,CUSTOMER,103,"These guys here - these guys!
It's always the same!  It's always
more!  He's a liar!"
104,WIFE,104,"Please, dear."
105,CUSTOMER,105,We went over this and over this -
106,JERRY,106,"So you're goin' to the Gophers
on Sunday?"
107,SALESMAN,107,You bet.
108,JERRY,108,"You wouldn't have an extra ticket
there?"
109,SALESMAN,109,They're playin' the Buckeyes!
110,JERRY,110,Yah.
111,SALESMAN,111,Ya kiddin'!
112,JERRY,112,"Well, he never done this before,
but seein' as it's special
circumstances and all, he says I
can knock one hunnert off that
TruCoat."
113,CUSTOMER,113,"One hundred!  You lied to me, Mr.
Lundegaard.  You're a bald-faced
liar!"
114,CUSTOMER,114,...  A fucking liar -
115,WIFE,115,"Bucky, please!"
116,JERRY,116,"One hunnert's the best we can

170,SHEP,170,Call 'em up.
171,JERRY,171,"Yah, well, see, I did that, and
I haven't been able to get 'em,
so I thought you maybe'd know an
alternate number or what have ya."
172,SHEP,172,Nope.
173,JERRY,173,"Okay, well, real good, then."
174,CARL,174,"...  Look at that.  Twin Cities.
IDS Building, the big glass one.
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.
After the Sears, uh, Chicago...
You never been to Minneapolis?"
175,GRIMSRUD,175,No.
176,CARL,176,"...  Would it kill you to say
something?"
177,GRIMSRUD,177,I did.
178,CARL,178,"""No."" First thing you've said
in the last four hours.  That's
a, that's a fountain of conversation,
man.  That's a geyser.  I mean, whoa,

sittin' here driving, man, doin'
all the driving, whole fuckin' way
from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to,
you know, tryin' to chat, keep
our spirits up, fight the boredom
of the road, and you can't say one
fucking thing just in the way of
conversation."
179,CARL,179,"...  Well, fuck it, I don't have
to talk either, man.  See how
you like it..."
180,CARL,180,...  Total silence...
181,JERRY,181,"Yah, real good.  How you doin'?"
182,VOICE,182,"Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.
You're damned hard to get on the
phone."
183,JERRY,183,"Yah, it's pretty darned busy here,
but that's the way we like it."
184,VOICE,184,"That's for sure.  Now, I just
need, on these last, these financing
documents you sent us, I can't
read the serial numbers of the
vehicles on here, so I -"
185,JERRY,185,"But I already got the, it's okay,
the loans are in place, I already
got the, the what, the -"
186,VOICE,186,"Yeah, the three hundred and twenty
thousand dollars, you got the money
last month."
187,JERRY,187,"Yah, so we're all set."
188,VOICE,188,"Yeah, but the vehicles you were
borrowing on, I just can't read
the serial numbers on your
applicaton.  Maybe if you could
just read them to me -"
189,JERRY,189,"But the deal's already done, I
already got the money -"
190,VOICE,190,"Yeah, but we have an audit here,
I just have to know that these
vehicles you're financing with
this money, that they really
exist."
191,JERRY,191,"Yah, well, they exist all right."
192,VOICE,192,"I'm sure they do - ha ha!  But
I can't read their serial numbers
here.  So if you could read me -"
193,JERRY,193,"Well, but see, I don't have 'em
in front a me - why don't I just
fax you over a copy -"
194,VOICE,194,"No, fax is no good, that's what
I have and I can't read the darn
thing -"
195,JERRY,195,"Yah, okay, I'll have my girl
send you over a copy, then."
196,VOICE,196,"Okay, because if I can't correlate
this note with the specific vehicles,
then I gotta call back that money -"
197,JERRY,197,"Yah, how much money was that?"
198,VOICE,198,"Three hundred and twenty thousand
dollars.  See, I gotta correlate
that money with the cars it's being
lent on."
199,JERRY,199,"Yah, no problem, I'll just fax
that over to ya, then."
200,VOICE,200,"No, no, fax is -"
201,JERRY,201,"I mean send it over.  I'll shoot
it right over to ya."
202,VOICE,202,Okay.
203,JERRY,203,"Okay, real good, then."
204,HOST,204,"So I seperate the - how the heck
do I get the egg out of the shell
without breaking it?"
205,HOSTESS,205,"You just prick a little hole in
the end and blow!"
206,HOST,206,"Okay, here goes nothing."
207,AUDIENCE,207,Awoooo!
208,GRIMSRUD,208,Unguent.
209,CARL,209,Huh?
210,GRIMSRUD,210,I need ... unguent.
211,JERRY,211,"How ya doin' there, Stan?  How
are ya, Wade?"
212,STAN,212,"Good to see ya again, Jerry.  If
these numbers are right, this
looks pretty sweet."
213,JERRY,213,"Oh, those numbers are all right,
bleemee."
214,WADE,214,This is do-able.
215,STAN,215,"Congratulations, Jerry."
216,JERRY,216,"Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -"
217,WADE,217,"What kind of finder's fee were
you looking for?"
218,JERRY,218,...  Huh?
219,STAN,219,"The financials are pretty thorough,
so the only thing we don't know
is your fee."
220,JERRY,220,"...  My fee?  Wade, what the
heck're you talkin' about?"
221,WADE,221,Stan and I're okay.
222,JERRY,222,Yah.
223,WADE,223,We're good to loan in.
224,JERRY,224,Yah.
225,WADE,225,"But we never talked about your
fee for bringin' it to us."
226,JERRY,226,"No, but, Wade, see, I was
bringin' you this deal for you
to loan me the money to put
in.  It's my deal here, see?"
227,STAN,227,"Jerry - we thought you were
bringin' us an investment."
228,JERRY,228,"Yah, right -"
229,STAN,229,"You're sayin' - what're you
sayin'?"
230,WADE,230,"You're sayin' that we put in
all the money and you collect
when it pays off?"
231,JERRY,231,"No, no.  I - I'd, I'd - pay you
back the principal, and interest
- heck, I'd go - one over prime -"
232,STAN,232,"We're not a bank, Jerry."
233,WADE,233,"What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted
bank interest on seven hunnert'n
fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest
Federal.  Talk to Bill Diehl."
234,STAN,234,He's at Norstar.
235,WADE,235,He's at -
236,JERRY,236,"No, see, I don't need a finder's
fee, I need - finder's fee's, what,
ten percent, heck that's not gonna
do it for me.  I need the principal."
237,STAN,237,"Jerry, we're not just going to
give you seven hundred and fifty
thousand dollars."
238,WADE,238,"What the heck were you thinkin'?
Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank
interest, I'd look for complete
security.  Heck, FDIC.  I don't
see nothin' like that here."
239,JERRY,239,"Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd
guarantee ya your money back."
240,WADE,240,"I'm not talkin' about your damn
word, Jerry.  Geez, what the
heck're you?...  Well, look, I
don't want to cut you out of the
loop, but his here's a good deal.
I assume, if you're not innarested,
you won't mind if we move on it
independently."
241,JERRY,241,Hon?
242,JERRY,242,...  Got the growshries...
243,JERRY,243,...  Hon?
244,JERRY,244,"Yah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I."
245,JERRY,245,"...  Yah, Wade, it's, I, it's
Jerry..."
246,JERRY,246,"...  Wade, it's Jerry, I - we
gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible..."
247,JERRY,247,"...  Yah, Wade Gustafson, please."
248,GRIMSRUD,248,"Shut the fuck up or I'll throw
you back in the trunk, you know."
249,CARL,249,"Geez.  That's more'n I've heard
you say all week."
250,CARL,250,"Ah, shit, the tags..."
251,CARL,251,"...  It's just the tags.  I never
put my tags on the car.  Don't
worry, I'll take care of this."
252,CARL,252,"...  Let's keep still back there,
lady, or we're gonna have to, ya
know, to shoot ya."
253,CARL,253,...  Hey!  I'll take care of this!
254,CARL,254,"How can I help you, officer?"
255,TROOPER,255,"This is a new car, then, sir?"
256,CARL,256,"It certainly is, officer.  Still
got that smell!"
257,TROOPER,257,"You're required to display
temporary tags, either in the
plate area or taped inside the
back window."
258,CARL,258,Certainly -
259,TROOPER,259,"Can I see your license and
registration please?"
260,CARL,260,Certainly.
261,CARL,261,"...  I was gonna tape up the
temporary tag, ya know, to be
in full compliance, but it, uh,
it, uh ... must a slipped my
mind..."
262,CARL,262,"...  So maybe the best thing
would be to take care of that,
right here in Brainerd."
263,TROOPER,263,"What's this, sir?"
264,CARL,264,"That's my license and regis-
tration.  I wanna be in
compliance."
265,CARL,265,"...  I was just thinking I could
take care of it right here.  In
Brainerd."
266,TROOPER,266,"Put that back in your pocket,
please."

296,MARGE,296,"Yah, thanks a bunch.  So what's
the deal, now?  Gary says triple
homicide?"
297,LOU,297,"Yah, looks pretty bad.  Two
of'm're over here."
298,MARGE,298,Where is everybody?
299,LOU,299,"Well - it's cold, Margie."
300,MARGE,300,"Ah, geez.  So...  Aw, geez.
Here's the second one...  It's
in the head and the ... hand
there, I guess that's a defensive
wound.  Okay."
301,MARGE,301,...  Where's the state trooper?
302,LOU,302,"Back there a good piece.  In
the ditch next to his prowler."
303,MARGE,303,"Okay, so we got a state trooper
pulls someone over, we got a
shooting, and these folks drive
by, and we got a high-speed
pursuit, ends here, and this
execution-type deal."
304,LOU,304,Yah.
305,MARGE,305,"I'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from Brainerd."
306,LOU,306,Yah.
307,MARGE,307,"Yah.  And I'll tell you what, from
his footprints he looks like a big
fella -"
308,LOU,308,"Ya see something down there, Chief?"
309,MARGE,309,"Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf."
310,LOU,310,"Geez, you okay, Margie?"
311,MARGE,311,"I'm fine - it's just morning
sickness."
312,MARGE,312,"...  Well, that passed."
313,LOU,313,Yah?
314,MARGE,314,Yah.  Now I'm hungry again.
315,LOU,315,"You had breakfast yet, Margie?"
316,MARGE,316,"Oh, yah.  Norm made some eggs."
317,LOU,317,"Yah?  Well, what now, d'ya think?"
318,MARGE,318,"Let's go take a look at that
trooper."
319,MARGE,319,"There's two of 'em, Lou!"
320,LOU,320,Yah?
321,MARGE,321,"Yah, this guy's smaller than
his buddy."
322,LOU,322,"Oh, yah?"
323,MARGE,323,For Pete's sake.
324,LOU,324,"How's it look, Marge?"
325,MARGE,325,"Well, he's got his gun on his hip
there, and he looks like a nice
enough guy.  It's a real shame."
326,LOU,326,Yah.
327,MARGE,327,"You haven't monkeyed with his car
there, have ya?"
328,LOU,328,No way.
329,MARGE,329,"Somebody shut his lights.  I guess
the little guy sat in there, waitin'
for his buddy t'come back."
330,LOU,330,"Yah, woulda been cold out here."
331,MARGE,331,"Heck, yah.  Ya think, is Dave open
yet?"
332,LOU,332,You don't think he's mixed up in -
333,MARGE,333,"No, no, I just wanna get Norm some
night crawlers."
334,MARGE,334,You look in his citation book?
335,LOU,335,Yah...
336,LOU,336,"...  Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.
Under the plate number he put
DLR - I figure they stopped him
or shot him before he could finish
fillin' out the tag number."
337,MARGE,337,Uh-huh.
338,LOU,338,"So I got the state lookin' for a
Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.
They don't got no match yet."
339,MARGE,339,"I'm not sure I agree with you a
hunnert percent on your policework,
there, Lou."
340,LOU,340,Yah?
341,MARGE,341,"Yah, I think that vehicle there
probly had dealer plates.  DLR?"
342,LOU,342,Oh...
343,LOU,343,...  Geez.
344,MARGE,344,"Yah.  Say, Lou, ya hear the one
about the guy who couldn't afford
personalized plates, so he went
and changed his name to J2L 4685?"
345,LOU,345,"Yah, that's a good one."
346,MARGE,346,Yah.
347,WADE,347,"-  All's I know is, ya got a
problem, ya call a professional!"
348,JERRY,348,"No!  They said no cops!  They were
darned clear on that, Wade!  They
said you call the cops and we -"
349,WADE,349,"Well, a course they're gonna say
that!  But where's my protection?
They got Jean here!  I give these
sons a bitches a million dollars,
where's my guarantee they're gonna
let her go."
350,JERRY,350,"Well, they -"
351,WADE,351,"A million dollars is a lot a damn
money!  And there they are, they
got my daughter!"
352,JERRY,352,"Yah, but think this thing through
here, Wade.  Ya give 'em what they
want, why wont' they let her go?
You gotta listen to me on this one,
Wade."
353,WADE,353,"Heck, you don't know!  You're just
whistlin' Dixie here!  I'm sayin',
the cops, they can advise us on
this!  I'm sayin' call a professional!"
354,JERRY,354,"No!  No cops!  That's final!  This
is my deal here, Wade!  Jean is
my wife here!"
355,STAN,355,"I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin'
to Jerry's viewpoint here."
356,WADE,356,Well -
357,STAN,357,"We gotta protect Jean.  These -
we're not holdin' any cards here,
Wade, they got all of 'em.  So
they call the shots."
358,JERRY,358,You're darned tootin'!
359,WADE,359,"Ah, dammit!"
360,STAN,360,I'm tellin' ya.
361,WADE,361,Well...  Why don't we...
362,WADE,362,"...  Stan, I'm thinkin' we should
offer 'em half a million."
363,JERRY,363,"Now come on here, no way, Wade!
No way!"
364,STAN,364,"We're not horse-trading here, Wade,
we just gotta bite the bullet on
this thing."
365,JERRY,365,Yah!
366,STAN,366,"What's the next step here, Jerry?"
367,JERRY,367,"They're gonna call, give me
instructions for a drop.  I'm
supposed to have the money ready
tomorrow."
368,WADE,368,Dammit!
369,CASHIER,369,How was everything today?
370,JERRY,370,"Yah, real good now."
371,STAN,371,"Okay.  We'll get the money together.
Don't worry about it, Jerry.  Now,
d'you want anyone at home, with you,
until they call?"
372,JERRY,372,"No, I - they don't want - they're
just s'posed to be dealin' with
me, they were real clear."
373,STAN,373,Yah.
374,JERRY,374,"Ya know, they said no one listenin'
in, they'll be watchin', ya know.
Maybe it's all bull, but like you
said, Stan, they're callin' the
shots."
375,STAN,375,"Okay.  And Scotty, is he gonna
be all right?"
376,JERRY,376,"Yah, geez, Scotty.  I'll go talk
to him."
377,STAN,377,We'll call.
378,JERRY,378,"...  How ya doin' there, Scotty?"
379,SCOTT,379,"Dad!  What're they doing?  Wuddya
think they're doin' with Mom?"
380,JERRY,380,"It's okay, Scotty.  They're not
gonna want to hurt her any.
These men, they just want money,
see."
381,SCOTT,381,What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
382,JERRY,382,"No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here.
Grandad and I, we're - we're makin'
sure this gets handled right."
383,SCOTT,383,"Dad, I really think we should call
the cops."
384,JERRY,384,"No!  We can't let anyone know about
this thing!  We gotta play ball with
these guys - you ask Stan Grossman,
he'll tell ya the same thing!"
385,SCOTT,385,"Yeah, but -"
386,JERRY,386,"We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but
we gotta play ball.  Ya know, that's
the deal.  Now if Lorraine calls, or
Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in
Florida with Pearl and Marty..."
387,JERRY,387,...  That's the best we can do here.
388,CARL,388,Hold it.

406,LOU,406,"No motels registered any tan Ciera
last night.  But the night before,
two men checked into the Blue Ox
registering a Ciera and leavin' the
tag space blank."
407,MARGE,407,"Geez, that's a good lead.  The
Blue Ox, that's that trucker's
joint out there on I-35?"

kinda funny-looking."
415,MARGE,415,In what way?
416,HOOKER ONE,416,I dunno.  Just funny-looking.
417,MARGE,417,Can you be any more specific?
418,HOOKER ONE,418,"I couldn't really say.  He wasn't
circumcised."
419,MARGE,419,"Was he funny-looking apart from
that?"
420,HOOKER ONE,420,Yah.
421,MARGE,421,"So you were having sex with the
little fella, then?"
422,HOOKER ONE,422,Uh-huh.
423,MARGE,423,"Is there anything else you can
tell me about him?"
424,HOOKER ONE,424,"No.  Like I say, he was funny-looking.
More'n most people even."
425,MARGE,425,And what about the other fella?
426,HOOKER TWO,426,"He was a little older.  Looked like
the Marlboro man."
427,MARGE,427,Yah?

They said they'd call tomorrow,

be delivered by me alone!"
529,WADE,529,"It's my money, I'll deliver it
- what do they care?"
530,STAN,530,"Wade's got a point there.  I'll
handle the call if you want, Jerry."
531,JERRY,531,"No, no.  See - they, no, see, they
only deal with me.  Ya feel this,
this nervousness on the phone there,
they're very - these guys're
dangerous -"
532,WADE,532,"All the more reason!  I don't want
you - with all due respect, Jerry
- I don't want you mucking this up."
533,JERRY,533,The heck d'ya mean?
534,WADE,534,"They want my money, they can deal
with me.  Otherwise I'm goin' to
a professional."
535,WADE,535,"...  There's a million dollars
here!"
536,JERRY,536,"No, see -"
537,WADE,537,"Look, Jerry, you're not sellin'

That's that."

540,CLERK,540,"Real good.  How're you today, ma'am?"
541,MARGE,541,"Real good.  I'm Mrs. Gunderson, I

542,CLERK,542,"You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson."
543,MARGE,543,"Is there a phone down here, ya think?"
544,MARGE,544,"...  Detective Sibert?  Yah, this
is Marge Gunderson from up Brainerd,
we spoke -  Yah.  Well, actually
I'm in town here.  I had to do a

Oh, yah?...  Well, maybe I'll go

549,CARL,549,"I decided not to - I'm, uh, not
taking the trip as it turns out."
550,ATTENDANT,550,"I'm sorry, sir, we do have to
charge you the four dollars."
551,CARL,551,"I just pulled in here.  I just
fucking pulled in here!"
552,ATTENDANT,552,"Well, see, there's a minimum charge
of four dollars.  Long-term parking
charges by the day."
553,CARL,553,"I guess you think, ya know, you're
an authority figure.  With that
stupid fucking uniform.  Huh, buddy?"
554,CARL,554,"...  King Clip-on Tie here.  Big
fucking man."
555,CARL,555,"...  You know, these are the limits
of your life, man.  Ruler of your

561,SHEP,561,Nope.
562,MARGE,562,"Well, you do reside their at
1425 Fremont Terrace?"
563,SHEP,563,Yep.
564,MARGE,564,Anyone else residing there?
565,SHEP,565,Nope.
566,MARGE,566,"Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
came in past three in the morning.
It's just hard for me to believe
you can't remember anyone calling."
567,MARGE,567,"...  Now, I know you've had some
problems, struggling with the
narcotics, some other entanglements,
currently on parole -"
568,SHEP,568,So?
569,MARGE,569,"Well, associating with criminals,
if you're the one they talked to,
that right there would be a
violation of your parole and would
end with you back in Stillwater."
570,SHEP,570,Uh-huh.
571,MARGE,571,"Now, I saw some rough stuff on
your priors, but nothing in the
nature of a homicide..."
572,MARGE,572,"...  I know you don't want to be
an accessory to something like
that."
573,SHEP,573,Nope.
574,MARGE,574,"So you think you might remember
who those folks were who called
ya?"
575,MARGE,575,Mr. Lundegaard?
576,JERRY,576,Huh?  Yah?
577,MARGE,577,"I wonder if I could take just a
minute of your time here -"
578,JERRY,578,What...  What is it all about?
579,MARGE,579,"Huh?  Do you mind if I sit down
- I'm carrying quite a load here."
580,MARGE,580,"...  You're the owner here, Mr.
Lundegaard?"
581,JERRY,581,"Naw, I...  Executive Sales Manager."
582,MARGE,582,"Well, you can help me.  My name's
Marge Gunderson -"
583,JERRY,583,"My father-in-law, he's the owner."
584,MARGE,584,"Uh-huh.  Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd investigating some
malfeasance and I was just wondering
if you've had any new vehicles stolen
off the lot in the past couple of
weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass
Ciera?"

586,JERRY,586,...  Brainerd?

any vehicles go missing, then?"
590,JERRY,590,"No.  No, ma'am."
591,MARGE,591,"Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch.  I'll
let you get back to your paperwork,
then."

607,MARGE,607,"Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva

She was a year behind us."

for Honeywell for a few years now."
618,MARGE,618,"Well, they're a good outfit."
619,MIKE,619,"Yah, if you're an engineer, yah,
you could do a lot worse.  Of
course, it's not, uh, it's
nothin' like your achievement."
620,MARGE,620,"It sounds like you're doin' really
super."
621,MIKE,621,"Yah, well, I, uh ... it's not that
it didn't work out -  Linda passed

719,MAN,719,"Yah, right-o."
720,MAN,720,"...  So, I'm tendin' bar there at
Ecklund && Swedlin's last Tuesday
and this little guy's drinkin'
and he says, 'So where can a guy
find some action - I'm goin' crazy
down there at the lake.'  And I
says, 'What kinda action?' and he
says, 'Woman action, what do I
look like,'  And I says 'Well,
what do I look like, I don't
arrange that kinda thing,' and he
says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there
at the lake' and I says, 'Well,
this ain't that kinda place.'"
721,GARY,721,Uh-huh.
722,MAN,722,"So he says, 'So I get it, so you
think I'm some kinda jerk for
askin',' only he doesn't use the
word jerk."
723,GARY,723,I unnerstand.
724,MAN,724,"And then he calls me a jerk and
says the last guy who thought he
was a jerk was dead now.  So I
don't say nothin' and he says, 'What
do ya think about that?'  So I
says, 'Well, that don't sound like
too good a deal for him then.'"
725,GARY,725,Ya got that right.
726,MAN,726,"And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead
and I don't mean a old age.'  And
then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin'
crazy out there at the lake.'"
727,GARY,727,White Bear Lake?
728,MAN,728,"Well, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's
closer ta Moose Lake, so I made
that assumption."
729,GARY,729,Oh sure.
730,MAN,730,"So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I
don't think a whole great deal of
it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the
homicides out here and she thought
I should call it in, so I called
it in.  End a story."
731,GARY,731,What'd this guy look like anyways?
732,MAN,732,"Oh, he was a little guy, kinda
funny-lookin'."
733,GARY,733,Uh-huh - in what way?
734,MAN,734,Just a general way.
735,GARY,735,"Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr.
Mohra.  You're right, it's probably
nothin', but thanks for callin'
her in."
736,MAN,736,"Oh sure.  They say she's gonna
turn cold tomorrow."
737,GARY,737,"Yah, got a front movin' in."
738,MAN,738,Ya got that right.

744,MARGE,744,"Mm.  But ya think he's all right?
I saw him last night and he's -"
745,VOICE,745,What'd he say?
746,MARGE,746,"Well, it was nothin' specific
he said, it just seemd like it
all hit him really hard, his
wife dyin' -"
747,VOICE,747,His wife?
748,MARGE,748,Linda.
749,VOICE,749,No.
750,MARGE,750,Linda Cooksey?
751,VOICE,751,"No.  No.  No.  They weren't -
he, uh, he was bothering Linda
for about, oh, for a good year.
Really pestering her, wouldn't
leave her alone."
752,MARGE,752,So ... they didn't...
753,VOICE,753,"No.  No.  They never married.
Mike's had psychiatric problems."
754,MARGE,754,"Oh.  Oh, my."
755,VOICE,755,"Yah, he - he's been struggling.
He's living with his parents now."
756,MARGE,756,Oh.  Geez.
757,VOICE,757,"Yah, Linda's fine.  You should
call her."
758,MARGE,758,"Geez.  Well - geez.  That's a
suprise."
759,MARGE,759,Hello?
760,MARGE,760,"Mr. Lundegaard?  Sorry to bother
you again.  Can I come in?"
761,JERRY,761,"Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda
busy -"
762,MARGE,762,"I unnerstand.  I'll keep it real
short, then.  I'm on my way out
of town, but I was just -  Do you
mind if I sit down?  I'm carrying
a bit of a load here."
763,JERRY,763,"No, I -"
764,MARGE,764,"Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you
about yesterday.  I was just
wondering -"
765,JERRY,765,"Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had
any vehicles go missing."
766,MARGE,766,"Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean,
how do you know?  Because, see,
the crime I'm investigating, the
perpetrators were driving a car
with dealer plates.  And they
called someone who works here, so
it'd be quite a coincidence if
they weren't, ya know, connected."
767,JERRY,767,"Yah, I see."
768,MARGE,768,"So how do you - have you done any
kind of inventory recently?"
769,JERRY,769,"The car's not from our lot, ma'am."
770,MARGE,770,"but do you know that for sure
without -"
771,JERRY,771,"Well, I would know.  I'm the
Executive Sales Manager."
772,MARGE,772,"Yah, but -"
773,JERRY,773,We run a pretty tight ship here.
774,MARGE,774,"I know, but - well, how do you
establish that, sir?  Are the
cars, uh, counted daily or what
kind of -"
775,JERRY,775,"Ma'am, I answered your question."
776,MARGE,776,"...  I'm sorry, sir?"
777,JERRY,777,"Ma'am, I answered your question.
I answered the darn -  I'm
cooperating here, and I..."
778,MARGE,778,"Sir, you have no call to get
snippy with me.  I'm just doin'
my job here."
779,JERRY,779,"I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here.
I'm cooperating...  There's no, uh
- we're doin' all we can..."
780,MARGE,780,"Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?"
781,MARGE,781,...  Mr. Lundegaard?
782,JERRY,782,"Well, heck, if you wanna, if you
wanna play games here!  I'm
workin' with ya on this thing, but
I..."
783,JERRY,783,"Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!"
784,MARGE,784,Sir?  Right now?
785,JERRY,785,"Sure right now!  You're darned
tootin'!"
786,JERRY,786,"...  If it's so damned imporant
to ya!"
787,MARGE,787,"I'm sorry, sir, I -"
788,JERRY,788,"Aw, what the Christ!"
789,MARGE,789,"...  Oh, for Pete's sake."
790,MARGE,790,"...  Oh, for Pete's sake..."
791,MARGE,791,"...  For Pete's s- he's fleein' the
interview.  He's feelin' the
interview..."
792,MARGE,792,"...  Detective Sibert, please..."
793,WOMAN,793,"Well, so far we're just saying he's
wanted for questioning in connection
with a triple homicide.  Nobody at
the dealship there's been much help
guessing where he might go..."
794,MARGE,794,Uh-huh.
795,WOMAN,795,"We called his house; his little
boy said he hadn't been there."
796,MARGE,796,And his wife?
797,WOMAN,797,"She's visiting relatives in Florida.
Now his boss, this guy Gustafson,
he's also disappeared.  Nobody at
his office knows where he is."
798,MARGE,798,"Geez.  Looks like this thing goes
higher than we thought.  You call
his home?"
799,WOMAN,799,"His wife's in the hospital, has
been for a couple months.  The big C."
800,MARGE,800,"Oh, my."
801,WOMAN,801,"And this Shep Proudfoot character,
he's a little darling.  He's now
wanted for assault and parole
violation.  He clobbered a neighbor
of his last night and another
person who could be one of your perps,
and he's at large."
802,MARGE,802,"Boy, this thing is really ... geez."
803,WOMAN,803,"Well, they're all out on the wire.
Well, you know..."
804,MARGE,804,"Yah.  Well, I just can't thank you
enough, Detective Sibert, this
cooperation has been outstanding."
805,DETECTIVE SIBERT,805,"Ah, well, we haven't had to run
around like you.  When're you due?"
806,MARGE,806,End a April.
807,DETECTIVE SIBERT,807,Any others?
808,MARGE,808,"This'll be our first.  We've been
waiting a long time."
809,DETECTIVE SIBERT,809,"That's wonderful.  Mm-mm.  It'll
change your life, a course."
810,MARGE,810,"Oh, yah, I know that!"
811,DETECTIVE SIBERT,811,"They can really take over, that's
for sure."
812,MARGE,812,You have children?
813,DETECTIVE SIBERT,813,"I thought you'd never ask.  The
older one is Janet, she's nine, and
the younger one is Morgan."
814,MARGE,814,"Oh, now he's adorable."
815,DETECTIVE SIBERT,815,"He's three now.  Course, not in that
picture."
