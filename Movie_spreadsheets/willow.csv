0,DRUID,0,Is it a girl?
1,ETHNA,1,It is a girl.
2,DRUID,2,Show me its arm.
3,DRUID,3,"It's true then.  I must tell Queen
Bavmorda."
4,MOTHER,4,"Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're
going to kill my baby."
5,ETHNA,5,They'll kill you.
6,MOTHER,6,Please save my baby.
7,ETHNA,7,Pretend this is the child.
8,MOTHER,8,"Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you."
9,BAVMORDA,9,"We will start the ritual at dusk.
You're certain this is the one?"
10,DRUID,10,It bears the markings.
11,BAVMORDA,11,"I must see for myself!  Just as the
omen foretold!"
12,BAVMORDA,12,So.  You *were* the one.
13,MOTHER,13,"Yes.  But nothing you can do will
stop the prophecy."
14,BAVMORDA,14,"This child will have no power over
me...."
15,BAVMORDA,15,Where's the baby!
16,GUARD,16,The midwife!
17,BAVMORDA,17,"Find that baby!  Use the dogs!
Sorsha!"
18,BAVMORDA,18,Kill her.
19,DEATH DOG,19,Bordak!
20,MIDWIFE,20,I don't have her!  No!  No!
21,RANON,21,"Dada!  We found something in the
river!"
22,WILLOW,22,"I can't run off and play with you
now.  I've got work to do."
23,WILLOW,23,"But Dada, you gotta see it!  Hurry!"
24,WILLOW,24,"Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't
know where it's been.  It could be
diseased."
25,MIMS,25,It's a baby!
26,RANON,26,It's not a Nelwyn baby.
27,WILLOW,27,"No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn
baby.  It looks like a daikini..."
28,MIMS,28,"Ooh, it's so cute..."
29,WILLOW,29,"Mims!  Get back here!  It might
bite you."
30,RANON,30,"Can't we keep it, Dada?"
31,WILLOW,31,Absolutely not.
32,WILLOW,32,Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood!
33,WILLOW,33,"Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect --
that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon,
keep this thing hidden..."
34,KIAYA,34,"Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done
anything wrong!"
35,KIAYA,35,"Ufgood!  What do you think you're
doing!  I tell the planting seeds
in this village."
36,KIAYA,36,"I told him we didn't steal it, Wil-
low."
37,KIAYA,37,"You haven't paid your debts.  Where
did you get these seeds?"
38,WILLOW,38,"In the forest.  My family's been
gathering them since last fall.
There's no law against that, Bur-
glekutt."
39,KIAYA,39,"Willow!  You left the children
alone by the river??"
40,KIAYA,40,"Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get
your planting done before the rains
start.  You're gonna lose this
land."
41,WILLOW,41,"Absolutely, under no condition, is
anyone in this family going to fall
in love with that baby."
42,WILLOW,42,"Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby.
Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be
ignored!"
43,WILLOW,43,"This is bad.  If we're caught with
that little daikini it'll be the
end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need
that for the festival.
(indicates magic cloth)
Kiaya, what are we going to do?"
44,KIAYA,44,We're gonna give this baby a bath.
45,WILLOW,45,"Burglekutt's right.  There's not
enough time to finish plowing.
We'll lose everything and I'll end
up working in the mines."
46,KIAYA,46,"Willow, do you think we should take
her to the Village Council?"
47,WILLOW,47,"No, no!  They'll think it's a bad
omen.  There'll be a flood or a
drought or a plague and
everybody'll blame me for it!"
48,RANON,48,Look.  What's that?
49,WILLOW,49,"I don't know.  This is trouble.
I'll talk to the High Aldwin about
it tomorrow at the Festival."
50,WILLOW,50,"And now!  For our final amazing bit
of magic, I will make an entire pig
completely disappear!"
51,CROWD,51,Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss!
52,WILLOW,52,"Meegosh, I'm in trouble."
53,MEEGOSH,53,"Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need
a better pig, that's all."
54,MEEGOSH,54,"Now Burglekutt's got you in the
squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in
the mines like me."
55,WILLOW,55,"Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces.
That's the last thing I'd ever do."
56,WILLOW,56,I gotta get my crop planted.
57,MEEGOSH,57,"You know I'll help you as much as I
can, Willow."
58,MIMS,58,"Dada, can we get treacle candy?
Can we, can we?  Please?"
59,WILLOW,59,"Meegosh, can you watch the chil-
dren?  I gotta talk to the High
Aldwin."
60,MEEGOSH,60,The High Aldwin??  Why?
61,WILLOW,61,Sir!  I have to talk to you.
62,WILLOW,62,"Not today, Willow."
63,WILLOW,63,"It's a matter of great importance
to me!"
64,WILLOW,64,"Intuition, Willow -- remember?  I
know you're eager to be my appren-
tice, Willow.  But today is the
spring festival."
65,WILLOW,65,"Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!!
Willow Ufgood???"
66,DEATH DOG,66,Bordak!  Bordak!
67,MEEGOSH,67,What was it looking for?
68,MEEGOSH,68,"It said ""bordak""!  What does it
mean?"
69,MEEGOSH,69,"Baby!  It means baby!  It was look-
ing for somebody's baby!"
70,MIMS,70,Mommy?
71,WILLOW,71,Kiaya!  Kiaya!
72,WILLOW,72,"We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We
must take her to the Council."
73,WILLOW,73,"An evil beast from the outer world
has invaded our peaceful village,
looking for a baby!"
74,WILLOW,74,It's a sign!  An omen!
75,ANOTHER VILLAGER,75,Our crops will die!
76,ANOTHER VILLAGER,76,"Silence!  One beast we can kill.
But there may be more!  And they
won't give up their search till
they've found what they're looking
for!"
77,MEEGOSH,77,Whose baby is it!
78,MEEGOSH,78,Who's to blame for this!
79,MEEGOSH,79,Willow Ufgood!  Come before me!
80,MEEGOSH,80,"Earlier today you tried to tell me
something, Willow."
81,WILLOW,81,"My family found this baby in the
river, High Aldwin."
82,WILLOW,82,A daikini child...
83,(his eyes close),83,"...of some importance, I feel..."
84,(his eyes close),84,"That's what the beasts want!  Give
it back!"
85,WILLOW,85,"They'll kill her!  We can't let
this baby die!"
86,WILLOW,86,What do we care!
87,WILLOW,87,"...importance...yes...this child
is special..."
88,WILLOW,88,What should we do?
89,WILLOW,89,"This child must be taken beyond the
boundaries of our village.  All the
way to the daikini crossroads."
90,WILLOW,90,Who will do that?
91,SEVERAL VILLAGERS,91,Vohnkar!  Vohnkar!
92,SEVERAL VILLAGERS,92,"The outer world is dangerous and
corrupt, Vohnkar.  And this baby is
hunted by blood-hungry beasts.  Are
you willing to sacrifice your life?"
93,VOHNKAR,93,"If I go, who'll defend you if other
beasts attack?"
94,VOHNKAR,94,"He's right!  It seems only fair
that the man to take this baby to
the crossroads..."
95,VOHNKAR,95,"...be the very man who plucked
it..."
96,VOHNKAR,96,...out of the river!
97,WILLOW,97,"I can't do it!  I haven't put my
crop in!"
98,WILLOW,98,"You caused this trouble.  You found
the baby...you get rid of it!"
99,WILLOW,99,I nominate Willow Ufgood!
100,WILLOW,100,I will consult the bones!
101,WILLOW,101,The bones tell me nothing.
102,(he eyes Willow),102,"But I must make a decision.  Is
there love in your heart for this
child?"
103,WILLOW,103,Yes.
104,WILLOW,104,"The bones have spoken!  Willow?
The security of this village
depends on you!"
105,MIMS,105,Dada?
106,MIMS,106,"Watch out for brownies, Dada."
107,WILLOW,107,"I will, Mims.  Goodnight."
108,RANON,108,"Dada, what's a daikini?"
109,WILLOW,109,"Daikinis are giant people who live
far far away."
110,RANON,110,Are you scared?
111,RANON,111,"I could be you rguard!  I could
carry your spear!"
112,"WILLOW
(smiles)",112,"What a great son you are, Ranon.  I
wish I could take you with me.  Now
go to sleep..."
113,"WILLOW
(smiles)",113,"Now, you know where you're going?"
114,"WILLOW
(smiles)",114,"Down there, through those trees,
follow the river.  You'll know the
crossroads by a big daikini struc-
ture.  Willow, this is serious
business.  Don't waste any time,
the outer world is no place for a
Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first
daikini you see, then hurry home as
fast as you can."
115,WILLOW,115,"If I'm not strong enough to be your
apprentice, how can I do this?"
116,WILLOW,116,"You're strong enough.  But you're
going to need courage, Willow."
117,WILLOW,117,"I don't want courage.  I don't want
to be a warrior.  All I've ever
wanted was to do magic, real magic,
like you!"
118,WILLOW,118,"Real magic, Willow, is simply the
art of controlling the reality of
others.  You lack faith in your-
self.  You must learn to trust your
intuition."
119,WILLOW,119,"Go in the direction the bird is
flying."
120,"WILLOW
(amazed)",120,"Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd
turn Burglekutt into a toad!"
121,"WILLOW
(amazed)",121,"Waste magic on revenge?  You have
much to learn, Willow..."
122,KIAYA,122,"Willow, we've never been apart.  I
miss you already.  Take this.  It
will bring you luck."
123,WILLOW,123,"You cut your hair, Kiaya?"
124,KIAYA,124,Willow!!
125,KIAYA,125,"We've patrolled the hills.  This is
where they killed the nursemaid."
126,SORSHA,126,"She must have done something with
the child.  Widen the search!"
127,SORSHA,127,Get away from there!
128,WILLOW,128,"I hate this.  Where am I?  I should
stick you in a tree and go back
home."
129,WILLOW,129,I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.
130,WILLOW,130,That's it.  The crossroads...
131,WILLOW,131,I hate this.
132,WILLOW,132,I hate this.
133,WILLOW,133,I really hate this.
134,WILLOW,134,"Hey, Peck...get me some water...or
you'll diiiiie...!"
135,WILLOW,135,"I will--I'll getcha water--getcha
lotsa water--anything you say--!"
136,WILLOW,136,Peck!
137,WILLOW,137,"You're a weasely little Peck!
Gimme some water!"
138,WILLOW,138,I'm not coming near you!
139,WILLOW,139,"Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in
here."
140,WILLOW,140,Good.  How long will it take?
141,WILLOW,141,"Don't make me angry, Peck."
142,WILLOW,142,"You be careful.  I'm a powerful
sorcerer.  I could turn you into a
toad just like that."
143,WILLOW,143,Miserable Pecks.
144,WILLOW,144,That's more like it.
145,WILLOW,145,"Do any other daikinis ever come by
here?"
146,WILLOW,146,Why.
147,WILLOW,147,"I have to give this baby to some-
body."
148,WILLOW,148,"I'm somebody.  Lemme out and I'll
take care of your baby."
149,WILLOW,149,"No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a
reason.  I'll wait for somebody else."
150,WILLOW,150,Hey!  Somebody's coming!
151,WILLOW,151,Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
152,WILLOW,152,"No, you fool!  Put it out I say!
Out!"
153,WILLOW,153,No!!
154,PICT,154,Whose fire!
155,PICT,155,No!  Help!  Stop!
156,PICT,156,Where are they?  Where did they go?
157,PICT,157,"Thanks for your help, Peck."
158,WILLOW,158,Are you okay?
159,WILLOW,159,"As if you care.  I saved your life,
Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!"
160,WILLOW,160,"You wanna give your baby to them??
They eat babies!"
161,WILLOW,161,I don't know.
162,WILLOW,162,"The world's gone insane.  Good men
locked in cages, criminals running
free.  It doesn't pay to be honest,
Peck."
163,WILLOW,163,"Don't call me a Peck.  My name is
Willow."
164,WILLOW,164,"Hello, Willow.  I'm Madmartigan."
165,WILLOW,165,You a woodcutter?
166,WILLOW,166,Farmer.
167,WILLOW,167,"Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic-
tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me:
victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor-
rupt, rotten world."
168,WILLOW,168,"Listen, Willow my friend.  I'm
really a good man.  Give me my
freedom, and I'll look after that
baby for you.  Trust me."
169,WILLOW,169,"That's it--good--good--like that,
yes, good, good, the chain--that's
it, come on--come on--!"
170,WILLOW,170,"Nooo, I don't think I should."
171,WILLOW,171,"Peck!!  Stupid Peck!  I'll kill ya!
Let me out!"
172,WILLOW,172,"Morning, Willow."
173,WILLOW,173,"Sorry I yelled at you.  I've been
in this cage toooo long.  Can't
think straight anymore.  Owww...!"
174,WILLOW,174,You all right?
175,WILLOW,175,These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
176,WILLOW,176,See if this helps.
177,WILLOW,177,"Aaaaaahhhh.  Better.  Here, I made
something for the baby."
178,WILLOW,178,What's inside?
179,WILLOW,179,A tooth.
180,(Willow reacts),180,I'm strving.  I got no used for it.
181,WILLOW,181,Stop!  Wait!
182,(with authority),182,Smells like a battle.
183,WILLOW,183,Are you a warrior?
184,WILLOW,184,"The greatest swordsman that ever
lived."
185,WILLOW,185,What's that?  I hear something!
186,WILLOW,186,You hear trouble.
187,WILLOW,187,What is it?
188,WILLOW,188,"A hundred horses...five or six
wagons...  and about six thousand
fools."
189,WILLOW,189,Sir?  Sir!
190,OFFICER,190,Out of the way!
191,AIRK,191,"Push 'em harder!  No rest at mid-
day!  We need to make ten more
leagues by dark!"
192,WILLOW,192,"Sir!  Sir!  I have this baby.  We
found her in our village.  Will you
take her...?"
193,AIRK,193,"We're going into battle, little
one.  Find a woman to take care of
it."
194,AIRK,194,"He thought you were a woman, Airk!"
195,AIRK,195,"Madmartigan!  What did you do this
time?"
196,AIRK,196,"Nothing you wouldn't have done it my
place!"
197,AIRK,197,"I always knew you'd end up in a
crow's cage."
198,AIRK,198,"Least I'm not down there herding
sheep!"
199,AIRK,199,"You're lucky somebody got to you
first, Madmartigan!  I'd've killed
you myself after that stunt at
Land's End!"
200,AIRK,200,"Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa
here."
201,AIRK,201,"Hey, remember?  You don't need my
help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit
trap like this?  Come on!  I could
open it for you, but I wouldn't
wanna insult you!"
202,AIRK,202,"Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your
war for you."
203,AIRK,203,"You're nothing but trouble, Madmar-
tigan.  And I got plenty of that.
Stay in your coffin and rot!"
204,AIRK,204,"I'll be around long after you're
dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get
outa here I'll cut your head off
and stick it on a pig-pole!"
205,WILLOW,205,Friend of yours?
206,WILLOW,206,"Hello, little baby..."
207,WILLOW,207,"Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?"
208,WILLOW,208,I hate this.
209,WILLOW,209,"Nobody's gonna take your baby.
Know why?  Nobody cares..."
210,(beat),210,Except me.
211,(beat),211,"You wanna go back to your farm.
You wanna go back to your family.
I could take care of that baby.
I'll look after her like she was me
own."
212,WILLOW,212,"You don't know anything about ba-
bies."
213,WILLOW,213,"Ahhh!  But I know a lot of women
who do.  Why, if I had somebody in
my life--a little daughter for
instance--I'd have a reason to
live..."
214,WILLOW,214,"Willow.  You can't let me die here.
Not when I wanna help you."
215,WILLOW,215,You gotta promise to feed her.
216,WILLOW,216,I will.
217,WILLOW,217,Fresh goat's milk.
218,WILLOW,218,Absolutely!
219,WILLOW,219,"And give her a bath everyday, and
don't let her get cold.  And keep
her diaper changed."
220,WILLOW,220,Of course!  I promise!
221,WILLOW,221,"Come to Daddy, little darlin'."
222,WILLOW,222,I think she likes me!
223,WILLOW,223,"Here are her diaper rags.  And this
is her milk bladder.  And when she
cries--she's either hungry or she's
tired--rock her on your left
shoulder.  She likes that."
224,WILLOW,224,"Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good
hands.  You haven't made a mistake."
225,WILLOW,225,Bye.
226,"WILLOW
(to Madmartigan)",226,Please take good care of her.
227,"WILLOW
(to Madmartigan)",227,"You've done a great job.  Now you
go back to your family and get your
crop in."
228,WILLOW,228,"Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's
come home!  Welcome back, Willow!
He deserves a medal:  he's quite
mystical.  For honor, for bravery,
for his intuitive powers..."
229,WILLOW,229,"...let's make him Apprentice
Aldwin.  Better still:  High
Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf-
good, High Aldwin of---"
230,WILLOW,230,"Come back here, you!  That's my
baby!!"
231,WILLOW,231,"Oh no, it's a trap!"
232,WILLOW,232,Oh noooooo!!
233,WILLOW,233,Where am I?  Where's the baby?
234,FRANJEAN,234,"I am Franjean, king of the world."
235,WILLOW,235,That baby's my responsibility!
236,FRANJEAN,236,"I don't care.  We paid for her.  Go
back to sleep, monsieur..."
237,WILLOW,237,"Yeow!
(he loses consciousness)
Madmartigan...I never should've
trusted you..."
238,TEEMO,238,Tongue.
239,WILLOW,239,Who are you?
240,ROOL,240,"Quiet, you fool!"
241,"TEEMO
(formal)",241,"We are emissaries of her majesty,
Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of
Coshairm."
242,WILLOW,242,Queen Cherlindrea?
243,TEEMO,243,"She requests the presence of your-
self and the young princess."
244,WILLOW,244,Who??
245,TEEMO,245,"You're the guardian, aren't you?"
246,ROOL,246,"Quit yakking, Teemo.  We gotta get
outa here!"
247,TEEMO,247,"Elves!  They're always tormenting
babies.  They make them cry and
take their tears."
248,ROOL,248,Somebody has to do it.
249,WILLOW,249,Why??
250,ROOL,250,How else they gonna make dew drops?
251,WILLOW,251,I'm getting her out of there!
252,TEEMO,252,"No!  You let us handle this.  Come
along, Rool!"
253,TEEMO,253,"Watch this.  Right between the
eyes."
254,ROOL,254,He never misses.
255,TEEMO,255,"Ooops.  Was that right?  That
wasn't right."
256,TEEMO,256,Hyah!  Hyah!  Git!
257,WILLOW,257,I can't go out there with the baby!
258,WILLOW,258,Elves!!
259,WILLOW,259,"Ohhh, I hate this."
260,TEEMO,260,"Take your time.  Don't worry about
the elves.  They won't come out
here."
261,WILLOW,261,Why not?
262,ROOL,262,Because of the trolls.
263,WILLOW,263,Trolls?
264,TEEMO,264,"Relax.  They only come out at
night."
265,WILLOW,265,This is not going well.
266,TEEMO,266,"Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know
what to do."
267,TEEMO,267,"Come on.  This is a privilege.  No-
body ever gets called before Her
Majesty."
268,ROOL,268,Stand up!  It's the queen!
269,ROOL,269,Willow Ufgood.
270,"WILLOW
(blinded)",270,Yes...?
271,"WILLOW
(blinded)",271,"I hope you are comfortable here,
inside my kingdom..."
272,TEEMO,272,Talk!  Say something!
273,WILLOW,273,"I can't see anything--she's too
bright!"
274,WILLOW,274,I'm sorry...
275,WILLOW,275,"Broke-heart of nightingale for our
honored guest."
276,WILLOW,276,"It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy
has come true."
277,WILLOW,277,"You mean, you know who this baby
belongs to?"
278,WILLOW,278,"She belongs to all of us.  She is
the future queen and ruler of all
kingdoms on earth."
279,WILLOW,279,What a relief.  Now I can go home.
280,WILLOW,280,"No, Willow.  Your journey has just
begun.  It has been foretold that
this child shall bring about the
downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose
evil powers have darkened our
world.  Upon you depends this
princess's life."
281,WILLOW,281,Me?
282,WILLOW,282,"You are the guardian, Willow.  You
must take her to Tir Asleen."
283,WILLOW,283,What is Tir Asleen?
284,WILLOW,284,"It is a distant castle, where a
great king and queen will look
after Elora Danan and keep her safe
until she is old enough to rule."
285,WILLOW,285,"Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is
it?"
286,WILLOW,286,"The way has been lost in time. But
there is one person, a druid sor-
ceress, who might guide you there.
She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda
many years ago.  Her name is Fin
Raziel."
287,WILLOW,287,"You need a warrior for this job.
I'm nobody."
288,WILLOW,288,"You are very important, Willow."
289,WILLOW,289,"No I'm not.  Have you really looked
at me?"
290,WILLOW,290,I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
291,WILLOW,291,"Why can't you do it?  You have mag-
ical powers."
292,WILLOW,292,"My prsence cannot extend beyond
this forest.  But I can give you
these..."
293,WILLOW,293,"They will protect you.  Use them
wisely."
294,WILLOW,294,They look like acorns.
295,WILLOW,295,"Anything you hurl them at will turn
to stone."
296,WILLOW,296,They're magic?  Are you serious?
297,(sternly),297,"I am very serious, Willow.  There
is no time to lose."
298,WILLOW,298,"But I've got a family to think
about!  They need me!"
299,WILLOW,299,Hello...?
300,WILLOW,300,"Bavmord'a powers are growing like
an evil plague.  Soon she will con-
trol the lives of you children,
your wife, your village...everyone."
301,WILLOW,301,The choice is yours.
302,WILLOW,302,"I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do
it!"
303,WILLOW,303,But I only have one shoe.
304,WILLOW,304,"Wait till I tell my children.
Stuff like this never happens in my
village."
305,TEEMO,305,"Hey, careful there!"
306,WILLOW,306,"How do these work I wonder?  I got-
ta save one to show the High
Aldwin."
307,ROOL,307,Look!  Death below!
308,WILLOW,308,Daikinis...
309,HORSEMEN,309,Hyaaaaahh!!
310,WILLOW,310,"Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't
cry, Elora.  Things can't get any
worse than this..."
311,TEEMO,311,I'm not going in there.
312,ROOL,312,Me neither!
313,WILLOW,313,"Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What
could possibly happen?"
314,WILLOW,314,"Could you spare some milk for this
poor hungry baby?"
315,BARMAID,315,"Get outa here, Peck!"
316,PATRONS,316,"A Peck!  Get him out!  Beat it,
Peck!"
317,WILLOW,317,"I could use your help, boys."
318,WILLOW,318,Willow?
319,WILLOW,319,This is not fun.
320,WILLOW,320,Woah!
321,WENCH,321,Hurry!  Hurry!
322,THE OTHER WOMAN,322,How do I look?
323,WILLOW,323,You!!
324,WILLOW,324,Where the hell did you come from?
325,WILLOW,325,I trusted you...
326,ROOL,326,Who's he?
327,ROOL,327,You're crawling with rodents.
328,LLUG,328,Where is he!!
329,WENCH,329,"There's nobody here except me and
my, um, cousin."
330,WENCH,330,How do you do.
331,WILLOW,331,Hey!  Give me that baby!
332,WILLOW,332,"These Pecks make terrible nurse-
maids."
333,WILLOW,333,Nursemaid?!
334,WILLOW,334,They get too excited.
335,LLUG,335,Wanna breeeeeeed?
336,"WILLOW
(mischievously)",336,Time to change her diaper.
337,"WILLOW
(mischievously)",337,Time to leave.
338,SORSHA,338,"You!  Are you the mother of that
child?"
339,SORSHA,339,"No.
(looks at Llug; in a high voice)
I mean yes."
340,SORSHA,340,Let me see it.
341,SORSHA,341,I can't.
342,SORSHA,342,Let me see it.
343,WILLOW,343,No!  You can't!
344,WILLOW,344,I can't.
345,SORSHA,345,Why not?
346,SORSHA,346,Why not?
347,WILLOW,347,Because she's sick.
348,WILLOW,348,Because she's sick.
349,SORSHA,349,Give it to me!
350,SORSHA,350,Gawd...you're...beautiful...
351,SORSHA,351,You're not a woman.
352,LLUG,352,Not a woman??!!
353,SORSHA,353,After them!!
354,WILLOW,354,Madmartigan!  Wait!
355,WILLOW,355,"We could've been killed, Madmarti-
gan!"
356,WILLOW,356,Heeyah!  Heeyah!
357,WILLOW,357,Oh no!
358,DEATH,358,Bordak!!
359,DEATH,359,Bordak!!
360,WILLOW,360,Woah...woah...!
361,WILLOW,361,That girl is a vision.
362,WILLOW,362,Where's the baby??
363,WILLOW,363,I thought you had her!
364,WILLOW,364,Willow!!
365,WILLOW,365,"Now Willow, I know you're gonna
blame me for this but it wasn't my
fault...!"
366,WILLOW,366,Elora Danan!
367,WILLOW,367,"When I left the crossroads, I got
ambushed by an elf!"
368,WILLOW,368,Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
369,WILLOW,369,I did?
370,WILLOW,370,"I mean, of course I saved her life.
She's almost my daughter, isn't
she?"
371,WILLOW,371,"Let's get out of here before they
come back."
372,TEEMO,372,"Northeast is that way.  We've come
west and south.  I think."
373,ROOL,373,"Watch it!  You're gonna set us on
fire."
374,ROOL,374,Not a bad idea.
375,ROOL,375,"So you're on your way to Tir
Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you
this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't
exist."
376,WILLOW,376,"Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told
me."
377,WILLOW,377,"The Fairy Queen?  And the baby
here's a princess?  And these two
rodents are your guides?"
378,WILLOW,378,"Yeah well...in the morning I think
I'll be on my way."
379,WILLOW,379,"Madmartigan, I need your help."
380,WILLOW,380,"My help?  A great magician like
you?  You don't need any help."
381,WILLOW,381,But you're a great swordsman!
382,WILLOW,382,"You're not a warrior, Madmartigan!
A warrior wouldn't lie there and do
nothing!"
383,WILLOW,383,"We're in trouble!  You've seen the
big army that's after us!  You're a
fake!  You're a bum!  You're a--
you're a coward!!"
384,WILLOW,384,"What's with you, Peck?"
385,WILLOW,385,"I miss my wife!  I miss my chil-
dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing
up so fast, he even helps me on the
farm now!  And little Mims!  If you
ever saw her sweet little face
you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd
*melt*!"
386,WILLOW,386,"Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't
know anything about love.  You
don't know anything about any-
thing..."
387,WILLOW,387,"I was in love once, Willow.  She
had a hold on my heart.  I could
barely function."
388,(a pause),388,"I *was* a great swordsman!  I was
knighted!  I could have been king!"
389,WILLOW,389,You?
390,WILLOW,390,"Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed
me.  She robbed me of my dream."
391,WILLOW,391,I'll never fall in love again...
392,WILLOW,392,Madmartigan!  Madmartigan!
393,WILLOW,393,"Relax, Willow.  We're having fun."
394,ROOL,394,"That's it!  The sorceress lives
there!"
395,TEEMO,395,Are you sure?
396,"ROOL
(excited)",396,"Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on
that island!"
397,TEEMO,397,"That tree dosn't look like gold to
me."
398,TEEMO,398,Gold!!
399,TEEMO,399,"Its branches are supposed to be
made of gold, solid gold."
400,WILLOW,400,How are we going to get out there?
401,WILLOW,401,"We'll find a way, Willow.  Look
over there--that looks like a
village--maybe they've got a boat.
Come on, what are you waiting for?"
402,WILLOW,402,"Give me a hand here, Peck!"
403,BOY,403,What are you doing?
404,BOY,404,It's nothing to do with you.
405,WILLOW,405,We need to get out to that island.
406,BOY,406,The island is cursed.
407,WILLOW,407,"We've traveled a long way.  We're
looking for Fin Raziel."
408,TEEMO,408,The sorceress.
409,BOY,409,"She's there.  But you can't go
there.  The island is cursed."
410,BOY,410,Yeah?  Who cursed it?
411,BOY,411,"Queen Bavmorda.  Her powers govern
the elements."
412,BOY,412,"Ahh, he's trying to protect the
gold.  Come on, Willow.  Jump in."
413,WILLOW,413,What would the Fairy Queen say?
414,ROOL,414,She's not here.
415,"TEEMO
(to Rool)",415,Obviously.
416,WILLOW,416,"Without Raziel we'll never find Tir
Asleen."
417,WILLOW,417,We'd better go.
418,WILLOW,418,Raziel?  Hello?  Fin Raziel?
419,RAZIEL,419,Get away!  Get away!
420,RAZIEL,420,You'll die!  You'll die!
421,RAZIEL,421,Who are you!  Who are you!
422,WILLOW,422,"I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to
find Fin Raziel."
423,RAZIEL,423,That's me!  Raziel!  Raziel!
424,WILLOW,424,"This can't be right.  This isn't a
sorceress.  This is some kind of
animal."
425,TEEMO,425,Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
426,RAZIEL,426,What do you want!
427,WILLOW,427,"We need your help.  To take this
baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin-
cess."
428,RAZIEL,428,Elora Danan!
429,RAZIEL,429,"Rool!  Teemo!  You were right!
This whole tree is made of gold!!"
430,RAZIEL,430,"Fools!  You should never have come
to this place!  We're all going to
die!"
431,RAZIEL,431,"We've got to get off this island
right now.  Hurry!  The boat!  It's
our only chance!"
432,WILLOW,432,Madmartigan!
433,WILLOW,433,Wait!  Gold!  Gold!
434,WILLOW,434,"Help, Madmartigan!  The oar!"
435,WILLOW,435,My gold!
436,RAZIEL,436,Kill him!
437,WILLOW,437,No!
438,RAZIEL,438,Kill him!
439,RAZIEL,439,No!!  Help!!  Willow!!!
440,RAZIEL,440,"Willow...you...you got...magic...!
Wait...we could team up...!"
441,RAZIEL,441,Flee!  Flee!
442,SORSHA,442,"Raziel.  Did you think my mother
would allow you to escape?"
443,SORSHA,443,"This is what we're looking for.  It
bears the markings."
444,SORSHA,444,"Don't worry, Willow.  If there's
one thing I'm good at, it's charm-
ing a woman..."
445,SORSHA,445,"So.  Couldn't live without me, huh?"
446,SORSHA,446,Lose your skirt?  How embarassing.
447,SORSHA,447,Still got what counts.
448,SORSHA,448,Not for long.
449,SORSHA,449,"We'll join the column.  Bring them
with us."
450,TEEMO,450,We gotta follow them.
451,ROOL,451,"Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any-
way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's
go home."
452,TEEMO,452,"Get back here, Rool!"
453,ROOL,453,Ouch!  Let go of me!
454,WILLOW,454,I can't go on...
455,WILLOW,455,"Willow, why don't you use your mag-
ic to get us out of here?"
456,RAZIEL,456,He's no magician.
457,RAZIEL,457,He turned that monster into stone!
458,RAZIEL,458,Did *you* give that acorn its power?
459,WILLOW,459,No.
460,RAZIEL,460,"A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool
can use it."
461,RAZIEL,461,Then you get us out of here.
462,RAZIEL,462,I will!  But I need help!
463,WILLOW,463,I'll help you...!
464,WILLOW,464,I won't.
465,RAZIEL,465,You must learn magic.
466,WILLOW,466,That's all I ever wanted!
467,RAZIEL,467,Then I will teach you.
468,RAZIEL,468,"Nice horse...nice hair...real nice
hair...I'd say you've got the most
beautiful hair I've ever--"
469,SORSHA,469,Wolff wants to boil you in oil.
470,SORSHA,470,Don't tempt me.
471,WILLOW,471,"If you rest the baby on your
shoulder, she'll stop crying."
472,SORSHA,472,Shut up.
473,SORSHA,473,"Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman."
474,SORSHA,474,"My step-father's going to tear you
apart."
475,SORSHA,475,"I'm torn apart already.  I mean it!
Under all that armor is a
beautiful--"
476,SORSHA,476,"Who is that girl, anyway?"
477,RAZIEL,477,"Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter."
478,RAZIEL,478,"Forget that one, Madmartigan."
479,RAZIEL,479,"Willow.  To learn magic, first you
must make your own philosopher's
stone!"
480,WILLOW,480,What do I need for that?
481,RAZIEL,481,"We must start with feathers, dung,
and a lock of your hair."
482,RAZIEL,482,Now that's a woman...!
483,RAZIEL,483,"Keep working at it.  Forget all you
know, or think you know.  A
magician's power depends on disord-
er of the mind."
484,RAZIEL,484,You got that one covered.
485,WILLOW,485,"I hope she's all right.  How much
more do I have to do of this?"
486,RAZIEL,486,"Till it's in a powder.  The energy
exits within you..."
487,WILLOW,487,"I know, and the magician's goal is
to find his true self.  But what's
this got to do with it?"
488,RAZIEL,488,"As below, so above.  You hold the
univers, Willow, in your hand."
489,RAZIEL,489,"I'm beginning to think you two
*deserve* to be locked up."
490,WILLOW,490,"The universe is a living creature,
like you and me, Madmartigan."
491,WILLOW,491,We're a tiny version of all that?
492,RAZIEL,492,"As above, so below."
493,WILLOW,493,I'm all finished.  Now what?
494,RAZIEL,494,Burn it to a fine ash.
495,WILLOW,495,How am I gonna do that?
496,RAZIEL,496,"Patience.  Concentrate.  You will
find a way."
497,WILLOW,497,What's going on?
498,WILLOW,498,Hurt him and you'll answer to me!
499,SORSHA,499,"This baby won't do what I say.  You
seem to know what to do.  Here!
Make it shut up."
500,WILLOW,500,She needs to be changed.
501,SORSHA,501,I changed her already!
502,WILLOW,502,She needs to be changed again.
503,SORSHA,503,"Who is that horrible friend of
yours?"
504,WILLOW,504,Madmartigan.
505,SORSHA,505,Who is he?
506,WILLOW,506,I don't know much about him.
507,SORSHA,507,"He's very bold.  Do you really
think my hair is beautiful?"
508,WILLOW,508,"Uh, yes.  It's very nice hair."
509,WILLOW,509,She's hungry.
510,SORSHA,510,"I know she's hungry.  I tried to
feed her but she wouldn't eat a
thing.  I'm not a wet nurse."
511,WILLOW,511,Here.  Hold her.
512,SORSHA,512,"I tried everything.  A spoon.  I
poured milk into her mouth, she just
spat it out.  I don't know what to
do, I'm not a mother."
513,WILLOW,513,Sometimes she likes it heated.
514,WILLOW,514,She's a good baby.
515,WILLOW,515,I did it!  I got the ashes!
516,RAZIEL,516,Good!  The first step is complete.
517,RAZIEL,517,Did she ask about me?
518,WILLOW,518,Who?
519,WILLOW,519,"Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard
time.  You were in her ten all
night.  Did she say anything?"
520,WILLOW,520,She said lots of thing.s
521,WILLOW,521,Willow!
522,WILLOW,522,"She asked about you, Madmartigan."
523,WILLOW,523,Well what did she say?
524,SORSHA,524,"Here.  You're going to need these
where we're going."
525,SORSHA,525,She's in love.
526,WILLOW,526,"You're crazy.  I think you're in
love."
527,RAZIEL,527,"We don't have much time left!  Go
on!  Go on!"
528,WILLOW,528,"I must concetrate my
imagination...to creat a
new...reality!"
529,RAZIEL,529,What's the magician's weapon?
530,WILLOW,530,The limitless power of...
531,RAZIEL,531,"Your will!  Your will!  What else
could it be?"
532,WILLOW,532,"I can't remember all these things.
What am I learning?"
533,RAZIEL,533,The art of transformation!
534,WILLOW,534,But what am I gonna transform??
535,RAZIEL,535,Me!
536,WILLOW,536,You?
537,WILLOW,537,"What are you gonna become, Raziel?
Queen of the rodents?"
538,SORSHA,538,The baby's cold.  Take her.
539,RAZIEL,539,"You remind me of your father, Sor-
sha."
540,SORSHA,540,My father was a weakling.
541,RAZIEL,541,He was a great king.
542,RAZIEL,542,"Not like your step-father, not like
your mother.  He ruled Tir Asleen
with kindness, and a generous
heart."
543,SORSHA,543,My mother calls that weakness.
544,SORSHA,544,What do *you* call it?
545,SORSHA,545,I do what I'm told.
546,SORSHA,546,"Too bad you're not more like
your father."
547,SORSHA,547,Be careful.
548,KAEL,548,Don't tell me what to do.
549,KAEL,549,We gotta get the baby out of here.
550,RAZIEL,550,"Tonight!  Complete the
philosopher's stone!  I must be
turned back!"
551,WILLOW,551,"I'll do it, Raziel..."
552,RAZIEL,552,"Let it settle.  Carefully, slowly.
Concentration and will.  Now pour
the water off."
553,WILLOW,553,"Oooh, this smells terrible."
554,RAZIEL,554,"That's the life spark.  Exxence of
magic and sorcery!"
555,WILLOW,555,Ouch!!
556,RAZIEL,556,Shhhhh!
557,WILLOW,557,What'd you bit me for!!
558,RAZIEL,558,"We need blood.  To nourish the
stone.  charge the stone with ener-
gy."
559,RAZIEL,559,"The components of the stone are
fusing..."
560,RAZIEL,560,"Again:  what is the magician's
weapon?"
561,WILLOW,561,His will.
562,RAZIEL,562,Now use it.
563,WILLOW,563,I just wanted to test it first.
564,RAZIEL,564,"No!  Change me back into a sor-
ceress, Willow."
565,WILLOW,565,"Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha..."
566,WILLOW,566,What did I do?
567,WILLOW,567,"Not bad, Peck.  I'm impressed.  You
busted the lock."
568,WILLOW,568,"Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get
Eloran Danan."
569,WILLOW,569,Let's get Elora Danan.
570,RAZIEL,570,Wait!  What about me!
571,RAZIEL,571,"You're a magician, Willow.  But I'm
a thief.  Wait here.  I'll get the
baby."
572,RAZIEL,572,"I'm supposed to be a beautiful wo=
man."
573,WILLOW,573,"Come on, Madmartigan...!"
574,WILLOW,574,"What are you doing?  Get out of
there...!"
575,WILLOW,575,I love you.
576,SORSHA,576,"One move, and you really will be a
woman."
577,SORSHA,577,You're a fool.  Now put her back.
578,SORSHA,578,I'm not going to let this baby die.
579,SORSHA,579,Don't make me kill you.
580,SORSHA,580,I believe you would...
581,SORSHA,581,Why did you say that?
582,SORSHA,582,Say what?
583,SORSHA,583,I love you.
584,SORSHA,584,Because it's true.
585,SORSHA,585,I don't believe you.
586,SORSHA,586,"I wish it weren't true.  I swore
I'd never let this happen.  I hate
you.  I hate your beauty, I hate
your innocence, I hate the feelings
you've awakened in me."
587,MADMARTIGAN,587,"I'm in love with you, Sorsha.  I
don't want to be, but a power has
enchanted me and I stand helpless
against it.  It's torture.  Battle-
field or prison cell was never half
as cruel."
588,MADMARTIGAN,588,"I want you and I can't have you so
I want you all the more.  If this
were another time and another place
I'd--"
589,SORSHA,589,You'd what?
590,KAEL,590,What's going on here!!
591,SORSHA,591,Deceiver!!
592,MADMARTIGAN,592,Whoops!
593,MADMARTIGAN,593,Willow!  Jump on the shiled!
594,KAEL,594,Bowmen!  Horses!  After them!
595,MADMARTIGAN,595,"Sorsha!  I didn't betray you.  I
love you!"
596,KAEL,596,Kill them!!
597,WILLOW,597,Nooo!!!
598,MADMARTIGAN,598,"Willow!  Willow!  Are you all
right?"
599,VILLAGER,599,King Kael!
600,ANOTHER VILLAGER,600,Nockmaar troops!
601,MADMARTIGAN,601,Help us.
602,AIRK,602,"Madmartigan.  Settled down with a
family huh?"
603,MADMARTIGAN,603,"You left me to die, friend."
604,AIRK,604,You managed alright.
605,MADMARTIGAN,605,Is this what's left of your army?
606,OFFICER,606,Keep that baby quiet.
607,KAEL,607,"Where is it!  Tell us or we'll burn
your village!  Sorsha!"
608,OFFICER,608,Kill her.
609,MADMARTIGAN,609,You'll draw the others.
610,AIRK,610,"It's you they're after, Madmarti-
gan.  What did you do this time?"
611,MADMARTIGAN,611,"They're not after me.  They want
the baby."
612,AIRK,612,Who is this baby?
613,WILLOW,613,"The princess, Elora Danan."
614,PEOPLE,614,The prophecy has come true.
615,AIRK,615,Give her to us.  We'll protect her.
616,RAZIEL,616,Not safe!  Not safe!
617,WILLOW,617,"We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
She'll be safe there from
Bavmorda's powers."
618,AIRK,618,"Tir Asleen is a myth.  It doesn't
exist."
619,RAZIEL,619,"It does!  It does!  I will show
you!"
620,AIRK,620,"You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?
I've lost half my men fighting
Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock-
maar army.  Now you and this Peck,
and that magpie up in the rafters,
are gonna take 'em on alone?"
621,MADMARTIGAN,621,Then come with us.
622,AIRK,622,"The war is here!  In towns and vil-
lages like this!"
623,AIRK,623,You're chasing a dream.
624,MADMARTIGAN,624,Just get me some horses.
625,MADMARTIGAN,625,"Once again, Airk, we say goodbye."
626,AIRK,626,"One day one of us willl stand on
the other's grave."
627,RAZIEL,627,Nockmaar!  Nockmaar!
628,RAZIEL,628,This way!  The cave!
629,WILLOW,629,"Madmartigan!  I can't stand being
in closed-in places."
630,MADMARTIGAN,630,Want me to carry Elora?
631,WILLOW,631,I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
632,MADMARTIGAN,632,"She's doing a lot better than we
are, Peck."
633,MADMARTIGAN,633,"Willow...this may be a bad time to
ask this question but...what if
Raziel's wrong?"
634,WILLOW,634,"She can't be wrong.  She's a very
very very powerful sorceress."
635,MADMARTIGAN,635,"She's a bird, Willow."
636,WILLOW,636,"That's my fault, not hers.  I've
got to keep practicing.  I'm still
in the learning stage but magic,
Madmartigan, requires concentration
and--"
637,MADMARTIGAN,637,Watch it!
638,WILLOW,638,Ahhh!
639,WILLOW,639,I hate this.
640,MADMARTIGAN,640,"Go, Willow!  Run!  Run!"
641,MADMARTIGAN,641,Willow!  Willow!
642,KAEL,642,Go after them!
643,MADMARTIGAN,643,"Hurry, Willow!  Throw it!"
644,RAZIEL,644,Look out!
645,KAEL,645,After them!!
646,RAZIEL,646,Tir Asleen.
647,WILLOW,647,There's nobody here.
648,RAZIEL,648,"The Knights of the Pacalcade.  The
king's bravest warriors."
649,RAZIEL,649,"Turn them back, Willow!"
650,WILLOW,650,How??
651,RAZIEL,651,"Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur-
ry!  Invocation!  Release them!"
652,WILLOW,652,"Beings within, beings without!
Danu danu walkail funfawtha!"
653,WILLOW,653,"I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here!
Look!  You gotta see this!  I did
it!"
654,RAZIEL,654,More!  More!
655,KAEL,655,Assault!  Scale the walls!
656,WILLOW,656,Tuatha tuatha danu!
657,WILLOW,657,"Raziel!  I transformed them all!
I'm a magician!"
658,RAZIEL,658,"You didn't transform them, Willow,
you released them.  That was noth-
ing.  Now change me."
659,WILLOW,659,I feel like I could do anything!
660,KNIGHT,660,It belonged to our king.
661,WILLOW,661,"Capture the enery...limitless
power of the will...avvdachh doth
indicht rredd baerkinhaekin!"
662,WILLOW,662,"Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What
happened?"
663,RAZIEL,663,I hate this.
664,KAEL,664,Attack!!
665,MADMARTIGAN,665,Sorsha.
666,SORSHA,666,Madmartigan.
667,MADMARTIGAN,667,Whose side are you on?
668,SORSHA,668,Yours.
669,MINION,669,Arrrggghhh!
670,SORSHA,670,I love you.
671,KAEL,671,Sorsha!!
672,KAEL,672,Bordak!
673,KAEL,673,Kill them both!
674,KAEL,674,"Troops!  To Nockmaar!  Ride with
me!"
675,WILLOW,675,"I'm sorry.  There were too many of
them."
676,MADMARTIGAN,676,"Out for a little ride in the coun-
try, Airk?"
677,AIRK,677,"Thought you might get lonely, Mad-
martigan!"
678,MADMARTIGAN,678,"Thank you, friend."
679,AIRK,679,Let's go.
680,MADMARTIGAN,680,Sorsha!  Any way in there?
681,SORSHA,681,"No.  The fortress is protected on
all sides."
682,AIRK,682,Make camp!  We'll assault at dawn.
683,BAVMORDA,683,Kael!
684,KAEL,684,Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child.
685,BAVMORDA,685,We must start the ritual!
686,BAVMORDA,686,Who is that?
687,KAEL,687,An army of rebels and traitors.
688,BAVMORDA,688,Where is Sorsha?
689,KAEL,689,She has turned against you.
690,BAVMORDA,690,"Purify the altar!  Arrange the im-
plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha!"
691,BAVMORDA,691,This is not an army!
692,RAZIEL,692,"Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick!
Hide!"
693,RAZIEL,693,"Get down!  The ritual chant!
Quick!  Protect yourself!"
694,WILLOW,694,Why?
695,RAZIEL,695,Just do it!
696,MADMARTIGAN,696,"We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn
her over to us!"
697,BAVMORDA,697,"You dare to challenge me?  You are
not warriors.  You're pigs!"
698,BAVMORDA,698,You're all pigs!
699,SORSHA,699,Mother!  No!!
700,BAVMORDA,700,You made your decision!
701,BAVMORDA,701,"Begin the ritual.  Now!  Light the
first candle."
702,BAVMORDA,702,"Come, thunder.  Come lightning.
Touch this altar with your pwer.
Come into my tower..."
703,BAVMORDA,703,"Dark runes, dark powers!  Blend and
bind, bind and blend, Universal
night!  And the might of Nockmaar!"
704,RAZIEL,704,"It's over, Willow.  You did well.
You protected yourself."
705,WILLOW,705,"I've come all this way and now
Elora Dana's going to die!"
706,RAZIEL,706,No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
707,WILLOW,707,"She's too powerful, Raziel"
708,RAZIEL,708,"A true magician, Willow, never
surrenders.  She is a sorceress--I
am a sorceress!  Transform me now
and I will destroy her!  Hexagram!"
709,WILLOW,709,"Banish all disturbing forces from
this place.  Fire, water, above and
below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal-
ance."
710,"RAZIEL
(voice distorted)",710,Don't give up!  Willow!
711,WILLOW,711,Raziel!
712,RAZIEL,712,"We've got a lot of work to do, Wil-
low.  Bring in our brave men."
713,BAVMORDA,713,"Black fire forever kindled within,
Let the second right begin!"
714,AIRK,714,"Uphill with our rough weapons,
we'll never make it!"
715,SORSHA,715,Elora Danan will die!
716,RAZIEL,716,"By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the
runic drum!"
717,WARRIOR,717,"Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need
more forces.  I say we retreat!"
718,RAZIEL,718,"Bavmorda cannot transform you.
I've protected this camp with a
spell."
719,MADMARTIGAN,719,"Can you use your magic to get our
men into the fortress, Raziel?"
720,RAZIEL,720,"Bavmorda has shielded it with a
spell of her own."
721,WILLOW,721,Wait!!
722,WILLOW,722,"I have an idea.  Back in my village
we catch a lot of hedgehogs."
723,MADMARTIGAN,723,"Willow, this is war, not agricul-
ture!"
724,WILLOW,724,"I know, I know!  But this is a way
to get into that castle..."
725,AIRK,725,It's too much work.
726,WARRIOR,726,It can't be done.
727,SORSHA,727,Kael will never fall for it.
728,MADMARTIGAN,728,"I don't know, Willow."
729,WILLOW,729,"Madmartigan, you promised me you'd
take care of Elora Danan like your
own daughter.  She is all that
matters.  Are you going to abandon
her?"
730,AIRK,730,"Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna
listen to a Peck?  You and I are
warriors.  You know this plan will
never work."
731,MADMARTIGAN,731,"We'll probably die here, Sorsha."
732,SORSHA,732,I have no family.
733,RAZIEL,733,"If we do not fight, and the baby
dies, all hope for the future is
lost.  I shall face the danger
alone if I have to."
734,WILLOW,734,"Me, too."
735,MADMARTIGAN,735,"Time is running out.  We must now
decide who's going to leave and who
is going to stay..."
736,BAVMORDA,736,Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak!
737,RAZIEL,737,Time is running out.
738,WILLOW,738,Surrender!!
739,WILLOW,739,"We are all-powerful magicians!
Give us the baby or we will destroy
you!!"
740,KAEL,740,Kill them!
741,RAZIEL,741,"Patience, Willow."
742,WILLOW,742,"Courage, Willow."
743,AIRK,743,Let's squah 'em!
744,SORSHA,744,"No, Willow!!"
745,SORSHA,745,I will face my mother alone.
746,BAVMORDA,746,Sorsha!!
747,SORSHA,747,I won't let you kill her!
748,BAVMORDA,748,"You are a weakling.  Like you fa-
ther!  Can you not see that I am
about to become all-powerful!"
749,SORSHA,749,No!!
750,BAVMORDA,750,Raziel...!!
751,RAZIEL,751,"The baby will be queen.  It has
been foretold, Bavmorda."
752,BAVMORDA,752,"My ritual will kill the prophecy!
Now the child dies with it, its en-
ergy exiled into oblivion!"
753,BAVMORDA,753,"You see?  I hold the power of the
universe!"
754,RAZIEL,754,Not until your ritual is complete!
755,BAVMORDA,755,"And who will stop me?  The elements
are slaves to my command!"
756,RAZIEL,756,"There is no one who can match your
sorcery.  Except me!"
757,MADMARTIGAN,757,Airk!!
758,MADMARTIGAN,758,Airk!  Airk!
759,MADMARTIGAN,759,"Madmartigan...you're a brave
warrior...a true friend...a good
man..."
760,MADMARTIGAN,760,"We're gonna win this war, Airk."
761,BAVMORDA,761,"As above, so below!  Universe of
evil, Raziel!  It conquers even
you!"
762,BAVMORDA,762,*Stop!  Bring back that child!!!*
763,BAVMORDA,763,Who are you?
764,WILLOW,764,I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician.
765,WILLOW,765,I'm a *great* magician.
766,BAVMORDA,766,Is that the extent of your power?
767,BAVMORDA,767,Place it on the altar.
768,WILLOW,768,No.  You can't have her.
769,BAVMORDA,769,"By ritual, by sorcery, I well draw
the lightning and send this child
into the destructive realm."
770,WILLOW,770,"And with my magic I'll send her
into the...into the..."
771,BAVMORDA,771,You're no magician.
772,WILLOW,772,Into the good.
773,BAVMORDA,773,"Even I don't have the power to do
that.  You're a fraud."
774,BAVMORDA,774,Impossible!  Bordak!  Bordak!
775,BAVMORDA,775,Aaaaahhhh!!!
776,RAZIEL,776,"Willow...Willow...how...how did you
do that?"
777,WILLOW,777,"It was just the old disappearing
pig trick."
778,RAZIEL,778,"Willow Ufgood.  Take this Book of
Sorcery.  You are on your way to
becoming a great magician."
779,WILLOW,779,"Your dream has come true, madmarti-
gan."
780,MADMARTIGAN,780,"Goodbye, Peck."
781,WILLOW,781,"Farewell, Elora Danan."
782,KIAYA,782,Willow!!
783,WILLOW,783,Kiaya!!
