while ago. I'm getting very tired of
waiting - let's go find him."
3,LOUISE,3,"Hey, shit head. Leave her alone. Don't
force girls!"
4,COLLEGE BOY,4,"Jeffrey, your mother's on the phone. It's
an emergency."
5,LOUISE,5,Thanks for keeping me waiting so long.
6,JEFFREY,6,"Hello. Mom? What's wrong with Dad?.
What's happening?. Come home? Sure I will."
7,MRS. BEAUMONT,7,"I mean, for good, Jeffrey."
8,JEFFREY,8,"For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in
the middle of the term."
9,"MRS. BEAUMONT
(now looks very tired and",9,"Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition
is serious. It's going to cost so much.
We just won't have the money to keep you
in school. I'm telling you this now, so
that you can get your things together and
check out of school, honey, or whatever you
have to do. it'll save you another trip back.
You're going to have to work at the store."
10,JEFFREY,10,Can't you come to the damn airport?
11,LOUISE,11,"Jeffrey. I can't. I really can't. I
have to go to that class tonight. I can't
get out of it. I really can't. I love
you, Jeffrey. I'll miss you."
12,JEFFREY,12,"Alright. I'll call you in a couple of days,
you know. I'll let you know how things are."
13,LOUISE,13,"Okay. I'll be here. You better git-going. I
gotta go too sweetie. I hope your father's
okay. I love you. I'm sorry, Jeffrey."
14,JEFFREY,14,"I love you too, Louise. Damn it. I'll see you."
15,JEFFREY,15,Hi Mom. Hi Aunt Barbara.
16,MRS. BEAUMONT,16,"Where's all your things, Jeffrey?"
17,JEFFREY,17,This is it.
18,JEFFREY,18,"I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is
all I have."
19,JEFFREY,19,"You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice
flight?"
20,JEFFREY,20,Yeah. How's Dad?
21,MRS. BEAUMONT,21,He's alright. We'll tell you on the way home.
22,MRS. BEAUMONT,22,"He had a cerebral hemorrhage and they think
there's some sort of clot, or tumor, or
something in there. They're doing all sorts
of tests. On the surface, he looks pretty
good, but there are problems. They think he
may have to stay in two weeks now, at least.
You can go see him though tomorrow, Jeffrey."
23,MRS. BEAUMONT,23,"They tore down the A & P, Jeffrey. Did you
see that?"
24,JEFFREY,24,Aunt Barbara that was 5 years ago.
25,JEFFREY,25,"Home again, home again, jiggidy jog."
26,MRS. BEAUMONT,26,"Jeffrey, breakfast is ready."
27,"JEFFREY (V.O.)
(calling)",27,Be right down.
28,"JEFFREY (V.O.)
(calling)",28,"This is marvelous jam. Are you going this
morning?"
29,MRS. BEAUMONT,29,"I think Jeffrey would like to see his father
alone."
30,JEFFREY,30,What time are visiting hours?
31,MRS. BEAUMONT,31,"I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for
10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk
over; I need the car this morning."
32,JEFFREY,32,Well. Okay.
33,MRS. BEAUMONT,33,"Jeffrey, when you see your father."
34,JEFFREY,34,Yeah?
35,MRS. BEAUMONT,35,"He doesn't know you're out of school. He
thinks it's a vacation for you."
36,JEFFREY,36,What?
37,MRS. BEAUMONT,37,"It would be too much for him. So please
let him think as he does, that you're
home just to see him."
38,JEFFREY,38,"Thanks a lot, Mom."
39,MRS. BEAUMONT,39,.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave
40,MRS. BEAUMONT,40,"I think it's important not to get depressed.
Depression is a terrible thing. They say it
can bring on illness."
41,JEFFREY,41,Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
42,JEFFREY,42,"Please wait outside while Dr. Gynde prepares
him to see you."
43,JEFFREY,43,Prepares him?
44,DR. GYNDE,44,Hello Jeffrey.
45,JEFFREY,45,"Hello, Doctor Gynde. How is he?"
46,DR. GYNDE,46,"He's fighting hard. Jeffrey. it's very
important that your father doesn't try
to move. he's been immobilized. It would
be very painful for him. sit close. you do
the talking and moving. He knows you're
here. He became very emotional. I don't
think he likes the idea of you seeing him
like this."
47,NURSE CINDY,47,Mr. Beaumont! Your son is here to visit you.
48,"JEFFREY
(shocked but concealing it)",48,Hi Dad.
49,"JEFFREY
(shocked but concealing it)",49,Hey Jeff.
50,JEFFREY,50,"Looks like they've got you strapped in
pretty good."
51,JEFFREY,51,uh uh.
52,JEFFREY,52,Are you feeling okay?
53,(more mumbling),53,uh uh.
54,(more mumbling),54,"Good to see you, son."
55,"JEFFREY
(holding back tears)",55,"It's good to see you, Dad."
56,JEFFREY,56,"Hello. could you tell me if Detective
Williams is still working here?"
57,POLICE OFFICER,57,He's up in Room 221. Right up the stairs.
58,JEFFREY,58,Are you Detective Williams?
59,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,59,Yes.
60,JEFFREY,60,"My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near
you. I believe you know my father, Tom
Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?"
61,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,61,"Sure I do. I understand he's in the
hospital. How is he?"
62,JEFFREY,62,"He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're
doing tests, that's why I'm home from
school. I was over at the hospital this
morning and I was going home and in the
field behind our neighborhood. there
behind Vista, I found an ear."
63,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,63,You did? A human ear?
64,JEFFREY,64,"Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I
thought I should bring it to you."
65,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,65,"Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it."
66,"DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
(continuing)",66,"That sure looks like a human ear, doesn't
it?. Let's run it down to the Coroner's
Office and see what they make of it. Then,
I want you to show me exactly where you
found it."
67,CORONER'S OFFICER,67,"The tests will take awhile. Meanwhile,
we'll check the morgue records. I don't
recall anything coming in minus an ear."
68,"CORONER'S OFFICER
(continuing)",68,"Now if you'd found a jaw or let's say, a
heart, or even an arm, we would assume
that there was a corpse, however, a finger
or an ear. the person may very well be
alive somewhere."
69,JEFFREY,69,"What can you tell about the person from the
ear?"
70,CORONER'S OFFICER,70,"Well. when the tests are done, quite a lot
. Sex, blood type, whether or not the ear
came off a dead person. Right now, I know
what you know. It's a real human ear. The
human was, or is, Caucasian.
. also. It looks like the ear was cut off
with scissors."
71,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,71,"By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going
to the press and I'm going to ask you to
consider all you've heard strictly
confidential. Do not discuss this business
with anyone, but me, or other police
personnel. Got it?"
72,JEFFREY,72,"Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much
as you did."
73,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,73,Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
74,JEFFREY,74,"Hello?. LOUISE WERTHAM please. Louise?
. is she there?. Louise?"
75,(very happy),75,"Yeah! How are you? He's okay. in the
hospital for tests."
76,(very serious),76,I miss you so much.
77,(smiling now),77,"What have you been up to?. Louise, I don't
know. I've got to see how my father is
. It costs a fortune in that hospital.
When did he ask you to that?. Look. I
can't stop you. Go ahead. Just go ahead
. I may never be back, go. ahead. Look
Louise, stop trying to explain everything.
Just do it. let's talk again in a couple
of days or somethin', okay?. Yeah, I still
love you. Goodbye Louise. Goodbye."
78,JEFFREY,78,I'm going out for awhile.
79,"MRS. BEAUMONT
(looks at her watch)",79,Do you want the car?
80,JEFFREY,80,"No, I'm just gonna walk around."
81,MRS. BEAUMONT,81,Alright.
82,AUNT BARBARA,82,"Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln,
are you?"
83,"JEFFREY
(yelling back)",83,"No. I'm just going to walk around the
neighborhood. Don't worry."
84,JEFFREY,84,"Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey
Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?"
85,MRS. WILLIAMS,85,"Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back"
86,JEFFREY,86,"I just wanted to ask him a few questions,
that's all. Maybe I better go."
87,MRS. WILLIAMS,87,"Really, he'll be home soon, would you like
a cup of coffee?"
88,"JEFFREY
(thinks a bit)",88,Alright.
89,MRS. WILLIAMS,89,"I was sorry to hear about your father. I
know your mother from church. It's such a
shame."
90,JEFFREY,90,"Yeah, I know."
91,MRS. WILLIAMS,91,Would you like a piece of cake?
92,JEFFREY,92,No. No thank you.
93,MRS. WILLIAMS,93,"It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan
Hines' devil's food. real good."
94,JEFFREY,94,Yeah. okay.
95,MRS. WILLIAMS,95,Sandy?.
96,MRS. WILLIAMS,96,"Jeffery, this is my daughter, Sandy, and.
her boyfriend, Mike."
97,SANDY,97,Mike's gotta go.
98,SANDY,98,Nice to meet you.
99,MIKE,99,"Yeah, nice meetin' yuh."
100,JEFFREY,100,Yeah. It was nice meeting you too.
101,"MRS. WILLIAMS
(smiles)",101,He comes over to study.
102,JEFFREY,102,Yeah.
103,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (V.O.),103,Pam?
104,MRS. WILLIAMS,104,"In the kitchen, John!"
105,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,105,"Oh. Hello, Jeffrey. what's up?"
106,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,106,Come into the study a minute.
107,JEFFREY,107,"Excuse me, Mrs. Williams."
108,MRS. WILLIAMS,108,Certainly.
109,"DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
(to Jeffrey)",109,Shut the door.
110,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,110,"Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him
to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy."
111,"(clicks off radio, turns to Jeffrey)",111,"Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is
very interesting to us. Very interesting.
I know you must be curious to know more."
112,(scratches the middle of his back),112,"But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask
you not only not to tell anyone about your
find, but also not to ask more about the
case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll
let you know all the details. Right now,
though. I can't."
113,JEFFREY,113,"I understand. I'm just real curious like
you said."
114,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,114,"I was the same way when I was you age. I
guess that's what got me into this business."
115,JEFFREY,115,It must be great.
116,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,116,And it's horrible too.
117,(a cold look comes over,117,"I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to
be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand."
118,JEFFREY,118,Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
119,"MRS. WILLIAMS
(coming out from the kitchen)",119,"Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet
you, Jeffrey."
120,JEFFREY,120,"Say ""goodnight"" to Sandy."
121,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,121,We will. Good night.
122,SANDY,122,Are you the one that found the ear.
123,JEFFREY,123,"Yeah, how did you know?"
124,SANDY,124,"I just know, that's all. I remember you
from Central."
125,JEFFREY,125,Oh yeah?
126,SANDY,126,"You were pretty popular. Didn't you run
for some office?"
127,JEFFREY,127,"Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be
studying or something."
128,SANDY,128,Am I bothering you?
129,JEFFREY,129,No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
130,SANDY,130,Yes.
131,JEFFREY,131,How is Central these days?
132,SANDY,132,Terrible. boring.
133,JEFFREY,133,What else is new?. right?
134,SANDY,134,Yeah. What are you doing now?
135,JEFFREY,135,"I'm home from school. My father's in the
hospital."
136,SANDY,136,That's too bad.
137,JEFFREY,137,What do you know about the ear?. anything?
138,SANDY,138,"Didn't my father tell you not to talk about
it?"
139,JEFFREY,139,"Come on. you brought it up. Do you know
anything?"
140,SANDY,140,"I don't really know much but bits and pieces
. I hear things. My room is right above my
father's office. The ear. there's no corpse
in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come
off a living person. That's direct from the
Coroner's Office. The person is unknown.
There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on,
but I think there are some people who were
brought in for questioning on a murder case
that could have something to do with the ear.
I heard some of the same names."
141,JEFFREY,141,"Do you know who was brought in for
questioning?"
142,SANDY,142,"There were at least three, maybe four. But
a name that keeps coming up is this woman
who lives in an apartment building very
close to your house and also close to the
field where you found the ear. There's
also a business man over by the Franklin
factory district that was questioned. and
a musician. and some others."
143,JEFFREY,143,"Were all these people questioned this
afternoon?"
144,SANDY,144,"No. this has been going on for some time
. several months. About six months ago
some parts of bodies were found down by
the river. They were from people who were
reported missing. They never found one
complete body. only parts."
145,JEFFREY,145,The ear is from a missing person maybe?
146,SANDY,146,Maybe so.
147,JEFFREY,147,"It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know
what building the woman lives in?"
148,SANDY,148,"Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy.
They've had her under surveillance for a
couple of months, except I don't know what
they've found out because my father isn't
in charge of her."
149,JEFFREY,149,I guess you have to get back home soon?
150,SANDY,150,"Not really, why?"
151,SANDY,151,"You want to see the building?. Come on,
I'll show you."
152,"SANDY
(nodding toward building)",152,"That's the building. She lives on the
Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long
. the police are watching."
153,JEFFREY,153,Where are they?
154,SANDY,154,"I don't know. you're not supposed to see
them. They're supposed to see you."
155,JEFFREY,155,"Did they find out anything when they
questioned her?"
156,SANDY,156,"I don't know. like I said, she's not my
father's case."
157,JEFFREY,157,"Oh yeah. What about those other people?
. Anything?"
158,SANDY,158,"My father is watching the businessman.
The businessman had a partner who
disappeared. left his whole business and
family, his wife and two kids. They think
he's been murdered."
159,JEFFREY,159,"You really do hear a lot, don't you?"
160,SANDY,160,"Yeah, I guess so."
161,(they continue walking),161,"What are you going to do now that you're
home?"
162,JEFFREY,162,"I have to help out in my father's hardware
store. they're giving me sort of my own
hours for a while. which is nice."
163,SANDY,163,"Still, it must be kinda rough."
164,JEFFREY,164,"It's not bad. but it's bad enough.
it's a lot worse for my father."
165,JEFFREY,165,"I used to know a kid who lived there and who
had the biggest tongue in the world."
166,SANDY,166,What happened to him?
167,JEFFREY,167,I don't know. he moved away.
168,SANDY,168,I've gotta go in.
169,JEFFREY,169,"Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking
to you."
170,"JEFFREY
(continuing)",170,I guess I'll see you sometime.
171,SANDY,171,"I guess so. Like you said. It's a
strange world."
172,JEFFREY,172,Yeah. Good bye.
173,JEFFREY,173,"Hey, Ed, okay if I borrow these bug spraying
rigs later on?"
174,ED,174,"Listen Bud. If you need to spray for bugs
they're yours.  It causes me no pain."
175,JEFFREY,175,Okidoke Ed. Thanks.
176,JEFFREY,176,"You hungry or thirsty, or both?"
177,"SANDY
(taken back)",177,I don't know.
178,JEFFREY,178,I'd like to talk to you about something.
179,SANDY,179,"Just a minute. pull over and wait a
minute."
180,SANDY,180,"Please, don't say anything to Mike.
promise?"
181,JEFFREY,181,I don't want to cause any trouble.
182,SANDY,182,"I'm here, aren't I?"
183,"JEFFREY
(smiling as though he knew)",183,"I guess Mike's got some sort of sports
practice in the afternoon."
184,SANDY,184,"Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too
smart."
185,SANDY,185,"Alright, now tell me. What is it?"
186,JEFFREY,186,"There are opportunities in life for gaining
knowledge and experience. sometimes, in
some cases. it's necessary to take a risk.
I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could
learn a lot by getting into that woman's
apartment. you know. sneak in and hide
and observe."
187,SANDY,187,"You said it was a strange world.
and you're the strangest part of it. Are
you crazy.she is possibly involved in
murder. This gives me the creeps."
188,JEFFREY,188,"Settle down. I have a plan which I think
will work. There is very little for you
to do, but I do need your help.
.Aren't you curious about my plan?"
189,"SANDY
(thinking and intrigued, plus she
is beginning to like Jeffrey)",189,"It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess."
190,JEFFREY,190,"Alright. the first thing is to get into her
apartment and open a window that I could
crawl into later."
191,SANDY,191,"Now, how are you going to do that?"
192,JEFFREY,192,"Right out in the car I happen to have some
old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will
go to her apartment and be the pest control
man. I will spray her apartment. After a
few minutes you will knock on her door,
drawing her attention away from me and I
will then jimmy a window."
193,SANDY,193,What will I say when she comes to the door?
194,JEFFREY,194,"You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a
few ""Awake"" magazines for you. You don't
have to keep her very long. a few seconds
is all I'll need. Whatiya think?"
195,SANDY,195,"I don't know. it sounds like a good
daydream, . but actually doing it is too
weird. too dangerous."
196,JEFFREY,196,"Let's just try the first part. If that
goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one
will suspect us, because no one would
believe two people like us would be crazy
enough to do something like this."
197,SANDY,197,You've got a point there.
198,JEFFREY,198,"Now. we'll walk over so there's no license
plates and you give me at least three
minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I
need time to find a good window .alright?"
199,SANDY,199,Alright.
200,JEFFREY,200,Let's go.
201,JEFFREY,201,"Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute,
what's her name?"
202,SANDY,202,"Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh
Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number,
bright boy."
203,JEFFREY,203,"Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good
luck . three minutes, no sooner."
204,SANDY,204,"Alright. Good luck, yourself."
205,OLD LADY,205,"Well, it's about time you came."
206,"JEFFREY
(to himself)",206,That's a good sign.
207,DOROTHY,207,Yes? What is it?
208,JEFFREY,208,Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
209,DOROTHY,209,"Oh God, that stuff stinks."
210,"JEFFREY
(as he goes in)",210,Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
211,DOROTHY,211,"Oh yeah, that's good."
212,DOROTHY,212,What is this. Grand Central Station?
213,"JEFFREY
(to Dorothy)",213,That oughta do it.
214,DOROTHY,214,Yeah.
215,SANDY,215,Are you alright?
216,JEFFREY,216,"Yeah. let's get outta here. What
happened?"
217,SANDY,217,"I was just about to go to the door, when
that man did my job for me. Was it alright?"
218,JEFFREY,218,Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
219,SANDY,219,"No. I only saw his back. He went down
another stairwell at the end of the hall."
220,JEFFREY,220,"I didn't get a good look at him either, but
he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to
get a window, but I found this key."
221,(he shows it to her),221,"Pretty nifty, huh?"
222,SANDY,222,"Yeah, if it opens the door."
223,JEFFREY,223,Yeah.
224,JEFFREY,224,You go first.
225,SANDY,225,So. what's next?
226,JEFFREY,226,Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
227,SANDY,227,I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
228,JEFFREY,228,"You didn't goof it up, but. you still
owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight.
It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?"
229,SANDY,229,Yes. I do.
230,JEFFREY,230,"Well, it's Friday night and you're a
beautiful girl. I guess you would have
a date. that does that."
231,SANDY,231,"You really want to do this, don't you?"
232,JEFFREY,232,"I don't want you to get involved, really,
I mean, I do, but if something went wrong
I mean, like you said, they may be involved
in murder."
233,SANDY,233,"I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game
tonight anyway and he'll never miss me.
Afterwards he can go out with the guys.
Just so the record is kept straight though,
I love Mike. What do want me to do?"
234,"JEFFREY
(studies her a moment, then)",234,"First of all, we'll have a nice dinner.
Try to find out where Dorothy sings."
235,SANDY,235,"I already know. The ""Slow Club."" It's on
Route 7."
236,JEFFREY,236,"Great. I'll pick you up around eight
o'clock. Is that good?"
237,SANDY,237,"Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may
think it's strange. I'll walk over to your
house. I'll be there at eight o'clock."
238,JEFFREY,238,"Okay. You better get out before someone
sees us."
239,JEFFREY,239,See ya!
240,DR. GYNDE,240,"That will take care of you, Frances, for
another week. I don't want you to overdo
things either. Take it very easy."
241,AUNT BARBARA,241,"I'll see to it, Bill."
242,DR. GYNDE,242,Good.
243,MRS. BEAUMONT,243,I feel fine.
244,DR. GYNDE,244,"That's not the point. You're under a great
deal of stress. don't overdo it. don't
be foolish."
245,JEFFREY,245,"Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick.
What's going on?"
246,AUNT BARBARA,246,I'm not sick.
247,"AUNT BARBARA
(continuing)",247,We'll see who stays in my will.
248,JEFFREY,248,Can I use the car tonight?
249,MRS. BEAUMONT,249,"Of course, Jeffrey."
250,SANDY,250,What's the plan.
251,JEFFREY,251,"First of all, we're going to the Slow Club
to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for
awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway,
and then also we'll know she is there and
not in her apartment."
252,SANDY,252,Brilliant.
253,JEFFREY,253,"Then we'll drive back to her apartment and
I will plant myself there."
254,SANDY,254,This is not my usual Friday night!
255,"SLEAZY MAITRE D'

268,"M.C.

Miss Dorothy Vallens."
269,SANDY,269,"Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it."
270,JEFFREY,270,Why not?
271,SANDY,271,"It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I
shouldn't have told you."
272,JEFFREY,272,"It'll be okay. I don't think you should
wait out here though. I think you should
go home. Can you drive this car?"
273,SANDY,273,Yeah. but.
274,JEFFREY,274,"Leave it in the front of your house for me.

275,SANDY,275,O.K.
276,JEFFREY,276,"Could you wait a little while. this key may
not fit."

285,SANDY,285,I'm going to wait here until she comes.
286,JEFFREY,286,Are you sure?
287,SANDY,287,"I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and
know she's on her way up. Okay?"
288,JEFFREY,288,Okay. thanks.
289,SANDY,289,"I don't know if you're a detective or a

You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where
you live and I know ways to get you and I
know ways to kill you."
402,JEFFREY,402,"Please don't talk like that. You're upset.
I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I
did. I better go."
403,DOROTHY,403,"Go then. I can't let you put it in me now
but I want you. I like you."
404,JEFFREY,404,Then don't talk about killing.
405,DOROTHY,405,Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?
406,DOROTHY,406,Sometimes I think it would be fun.
407,DOROTHY,407,"Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't
open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little
secret."

(getting upset)",453,"Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you.
and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't
it. remember that. Your husband was the
one who started fucking my mind with drugs."
454,DOROTHY,454,"Oh he forced you, huh?"
455,YELLOW MAN,455,"He's the reformed dealer though who wanted
to turn himself in. he's the one that caused
Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real
good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to
be here watching you why can't I be here
fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the
size of a pin - let me give you the real
thing. let me wet my whistle, baby."
456,"DOROTHY

459,DOROTHY,459,"Who's it, you mean."
460,"DOROTHY
(continuing)",460,Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
461,JEFFREY,461,"There you go again. stop saying that.
You can make it."
462,DOROTHY,462,"I can't. I can't. You think you know
so much."
463,JEFFREY,463,"Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?.
Why are you in so much trouble?"
464,"DOROTHY
(whispering)",464,"I. don't. okay. Just don't. just be
with me."
465,"DOROTHY
(whispering)",465,"Oh God. Come with me. Who are you.
Come up here."
466,"DOROTHY
(as she stares down)",466,Look.
467,JEFFREY,467,No.
468,DOROTHY,468,"(continuing to look down, her"
469,JEFFREY,469,"No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so
much trouble?"
470,"JEFFREY
(continuing)",470,Who is Don?
471,DOROTHY,471,Don?. Are you in with them?
472,JEFFREY,472,No. But you're in very big trouble.
473,DOROTHY,473,"Why are you so interested? Why do you
keep asking me?"
474,JEFFREY,474,"I came back to help you. You said do I
let girls sneak into my house. You know
where I live. if you need to. come to
where I live. O.K.?"
475,DOROTHY,475,"Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like

478,JEFFREY,478,No. I should go.
479,DOROTHY,479,Please. please stay.
480,JEFFREY,480,Why Dorothy?
481,DOROTHY,481,"Don? I have to make it hurt. I want
there to be nothing again. Don!!!"
482,JEFFREY,482,"Will you tell Mom when she gets home from
the hospital that I've gone to dinner at
Sandy Williams' house?"
483,AUNT BARBARA,483,"Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey.
I think you've got termites in the house."
484,JEFFREY,484,Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
485,AUNT BARBARA,485,I've seen a few.
486,JEFFREY,486,"Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry
about it. Look. I better go."
487,AUNT BARBARA,487,Okay honey.
488,SANDY,488,"We thank you in the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen."
489,MIKE,489,"Like I was saying. if you toss the ball like
this, with your fingers just down here, that
thing'll spin like a beauty. real straight."
490,"DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
(teasing him)",490,"Yeah? Then how come nobody caught anything
last week?."
491,"MIKE
(not laughing)",491,'Cause we had a bad day.
492,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,492,"You play any sports, Jeffrey?"
493,JEFFREY,493,No.
494,MIKE,494,Looks like you'd make a good runner.
495,JEFFREY,495,Well.
496,MIKE,496,"I mean, you don't exactly have the build
for a football. I mean. no offense."
497,"JEFFREY
(not offended)",497,No. you're right.
498,MIKE,498,"I mean. some guys play anyway but they
usually get slaughtered."
499,JEFFREY,499,"Yeah, well I never wanted to get
slaughtered much."
500,MIKE,500,"Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the
point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?"
501,MRS. WILLIAMS,501,"No, Mike. but there are vitamins in the
food, you know."
502,MIKE,502,"Yeah, but I gotta supplement that. I gotta
take a bunch of zinc too. The body is like
a machine. EVERYTHING has got to stay in
perfect tune for perfect health. That's
what I'm interested in."
503,MIKE,503,Oh yeah. and a few other things.
504,SANDY,504,We've got some Heinekens.
505,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,505,Yeah. I like Bud myself.
506,SANDY,506,"I'll get it. Mike, whatiya want?"
507,MIKE,507,I guess another glass of water.
508,"MRS. WILLIAMS
(calling downstairs)",508,"Who wants dessert? It's blueberry pie. and
ice cream."
509,MIKE,509,"None for me, thanks."
510,"MIKE
(referring to T.V.)",510,What are watchin' this junk for?
511,SANDY,511,You can change it if you want to.
512,MIKE,512,I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
513,SANDY,513,"Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come
on."
514,MRS. WILLIAMS,514,Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
515,JEFFREY,515,That sounds great!
516,MRS. WILLIAMS,516,"Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a
minute."
517,MIKE,517,I'll be right back.
518,SANDY,518,"Well, how did it go?. What happened?"
519,JEFFREY,519,"Well. I've found out some things.
nothing really for certain. There are some
strange people involved."
520,SANDY,520,What did you see?
521,JEFFREY,521,Well.
522,"(looking around, feeling funny)",522,"Maybe we should discuss this somewhere
else. you know what I mean?"
523,MRS. WILLIAMS,523,Mike?. Are you alright?
524,"MIKE
(mumbling)",524,Yes.
525,MIKE,525,Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
526,"SANDY
(calling up)",526,Sure. just a sec.
527,(to Jeffrey),527,Excuse me.
528,MIKE,528,"Come on out a minute, okay?"
529,SANDY,529,Okay.
530,MRS. WILLIAMS,530,"Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll
get to the dishes."
531,JEFFREY,531,"Sure thing. please don't worry about me.
Can I help you with the dishes?"
532,MRS. WILLIAMS,532,"Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly
not. just relax and enjoy your coffee.
I'm sure Sandy will be back soon."
533,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,533,Jeffrey?
534,JEFFREY,534,Yes?
535,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,535,"If you want to come up a minute, I'll show
you some pictures."
536,"DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
(continuing)",536,"Take a look at these. These are the photos
of the vacant lot where you found the ear.
You might find them interesting."
537,JEFFREY,537,"These are beautiful. How's the case

538,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,538,Okay.
539,JEFFREY,539,Anything you can tell me?
540,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,540,The criminals are winning.
541,JEFFREY,541,Is that why you say it's horrible?
542,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,542,Yes.
543,JEFFREY,543,I guess you've seen some bad things.
544,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,544,"Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison
your mind by telling you."
545,JEFFREY,545,Why do you do it?
546,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,546,"I won't let the bastards get me up against
the wall. It's an act of defiance."
547,JEFFREY,547,Yeah. I get it.
548,JEFFREY,548,What is this? What color is it?
549,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,549,Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
550,SANDY,550,Can I use the car for a while?
551,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,551,Sure. What's up?
552,SANDY,552,I want to buy Jeffrey a Dairy Queen.
553,JEFFREY,553,A Dairy Queen?
554,JEFFREY,554,"Oh yeah? Sure, that sounds great."
555,JEFFREY,555,What's with Mike?
556,SANDY,556,He got a little jealous.
557,JEFFREY,557,"I'm sorry, I didn't."
558,SANDY,558,It's okay. Don't worry about it.
559,SANDY,559,You want a Dairy Queen?
560,JEFFREY,560,No way. I'm about to blow up.
561,SANDY,561,You want to tell me about it?
562,JEFFREY,562,". OK. It's a strange world, Sandy.
this is what I have found out. What I
think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens
is married to a man named Don. they have
a son. I think the son and the husband
have been kidnapped by a man named
Frank who has now cut off both of Don's
ears. I think he is holding them to make
her do things for him. I think she wants
to die. the ears were for her a warning
to stay alive. there is another man
involved. I call him the ""yellow man"".
you saw his back the other day in the hall
at her door. I don't know what he does but
I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank.
Frank is a very dangerous man."
563,"SANDY
(quietly)",563,Wow. Should you tell my father?
564,JEFFREY,564,"I don't see how I can. and I can't prove
any of this. I got all this information
illegally. also it could get you in
trouble."
565,SANDY,565,You saw a lot in one night.
566,JEFFREY,566,. Actually. I've been in twice.
567,SANDY,567,Twice. without her sensing anything?
568,"JEFFREY
(lying)",568,Yes.
569,"SANDY
(pausing)",569,Did you see her undressed?
570,JEFFREY,570,"Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know."
571,SANDY,571,Yeah?
572,"JEFFREY
(a searching, slight smile)",572,"That doesn't bother you, does it?"
573,SANDY,573,"Who, me? Why should it?"
574,"JEFFREY
(seeing some jealousy and",574,That's what I thought.
575,SANDY,575,You're sure right. It is a strange world.
576,JEFFREY,576,"Why are there people like Frank. Why is
there so much trouble in this world.?"
577,SANDY,577,"I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the
night I met you."
578,SANDY,578,". in the dream the world was dark because
there weren't any robins. you know, birds.
robins stood for love. and all of a sudden
thousands of robins flew down and brought
this blinding light of love. and it felt
like that love would be the only thing that
would make any difference. I guess. until
the robins come there is trouble."
579,JEFFREY,579,Yeah I guess so.
580,JEFFREY,580,You're a neat girl.
581,SANDY,581,So are you.
582,SANDY,582,"I mean you're a neat guy. We better
get back."
583,JEFFREY,583,"I guess so. you want to help me watch
Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's
place tomorrow. with a camera."
584,SANDY,584,"No, silly - I'm still in school you know.
but I'll meet you after school and you
can tell me what you've learned. You better
be careful, Jeffrey."
585,JEFFREY,585,"I will.  I'll pick you up on the same
corner at three thirty-five, okay?"
586,SANDY,586,Okay. be careful.
587,JEFFREY,587,"Okay, Sandy."
588,JEFFREY,588,Can I give you a kiss good night?
589,SANDY,589,"You better not, Jeffrey."
590,JEFFREY,590,Okay. okay.
591,SANDY,591,Goodnight.
592,JEFFREY,592,See ya tomorrow.
593,JEFFREY,593,Hello?
594,FRANK (telephone V.O.),594,Speak to me Fucker.
595,"JEFFREY
(to himself)",595,"Stupid!! So stupid. now she might be in
even more trouble with Frank. I hope not.
I hope not. tomorrow I have to find out
more about Frank."
596,JEFFREY,596,Damn!
597,JEFFREY,597,Wow.
598,"JEFFREY
(out loud to himself)",598,Fifteen more minutes.
599,JEFFREY,599,You gotta wait for me Sandy. I'm on a real roll.
600,JEFFREY,600,What happened?
601,GUY #1,601,He was blown away man. can't you see?
602,GUY #2,602,"That cracker was the biggest dealer in
this section of the city, brother. the
police are going to find more drugs in
there than you can believe. It's a
speedball heaven in there."
603,JEFFREY,603,Oh yeah? What about the woman?
604,GUY #1,604,"Probably just a whore he happened to be
with at the time."
605,JEFFREY,605,Man oh brother.
606,GUY #1,606,"This is the way the world is my man. take
a good look."
607,"SANDY
(looking beyond the car)",607,GO ON!!!. GO!
608,SANDY,608,Oh great.
609,"SANDY
(continuing)",609,You were late.
610,JEFFREY,610,I'm really sorry.
611,SANDY,611,What am I going to do?
612,JEFFREY,612,You want to go talk to him?
613,SANDY,613,"Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do
much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to
him later."
614,SANDY,614,"You know, that cheese is practically
all chemicals."
615,JEFFREY,615,"That's what makes it so good. You wanta
hear what I saw today?"
616,SANDY,616,Shoot.
617,JEFFREY,617,"Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into
Frank's building, laughing with Frank.
Now. the only trouble is. what does this
prove?"
618,"SANDY
(thinking)",618,"Nothing really, but it's interesting.
they know each other. they seem to like
each other."
619,JEFFREY,619,"Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on
drugs. I think Frank supplies him."
620,SANDY,620,Oh yeah?
621,JEFFREY,621,"Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out.
This time with a well-dressed man with an
alligator briefcase. They drove down this
factory building and stood on a staircase
looking at something in the distance.
Number three. now get this. In the distance
was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death
and a woman with her legs broken."
622,SANDY,622,Jeffrey!!
623,JEFFREY,623,"Then these guys told me the police will
find a huge amount of drugs inside the
dead man's place."
624,SANDY,624,"I can't believe what you are finding out.
Are you going to continue with this. Are
you going back to her apartment?"
625,JEFFREY,625,Yeah.
626,SANDY,626,Jeffrey?. Why?
627,JEFFREY,627,"I'm seeing something that was always hidden.
I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning.
and it's all secret."
628,SANDY,628,You like mysteries that much?
629,JEFFREY,629,"Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you.
very much."
630,SANDY,630,Oh yeah?
631,SANDY,631,"Don't. please, Jeffrey."
632,JEFFREY,632,You worry about me really?
633,SANDY,633,"Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I
worry. a lot. I got you into this."
634,DOROTHY,634,Come in.

827,JEFFREY,827,"Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a
problem. I know some things. that
could help your father but you
might get into trouble."
828,SANDY,828,"Jeffrey. are they important things?

835,JEFFREY,835,"Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you,
but I've got to talk to you."
836,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,836,"Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a
bad face lift."
837,"JEFFREY
(with a goofy smile to Sandy)",837,Yeah.
838,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,838,Okay?
839,JEFFREY,839,"Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered
some things. .Anyway I have to show you
some pictures and tell you some things
about them. The first picture is this."
840,"JEFFREY
(continuing)",840,"This is Frank Booth. His address is on
the back of the photo. He, in my opinion,
is very sick and dangerous. This photo
here is of Frank with another man as they
went into Frank's apartment."
841,"JEFFREY
(continuing)",841,"And that man came out with a third man -
this well-dressed guy. here's the photo.
I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is
in trouble with these people. I think
Frank has taken her husband and her son."
842,"JEFFREY
(continuing)",842,"I have no hard proof of any of this. Her
address is also on the photos. I think
these people are involved with drugs. and
murder. I think Frank is killing drug
dealers and."
843,(he decides not to tell Detective,843,". and somehow Frank is getting all their
drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly
more involved in this than you wanted me
to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to
tell you about these things in case it
could help."
844,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,844,"Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get
so involved?"
845,JEFFREY,845,"I can't tell you the whole story. I. I
took it upon myself. I can't say more."
846,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,846,Is Sandy part of this?

990,"DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
(to Jeffrey)",990,"Because of your information I alerted
internal affairs to check out Detective
Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as
if nothing was different.  He slipped
off on his own when he found out we were
going to raid Frank's place."
991,JEFFREY,991,Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
992,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,992,Not yet.
993,JEFFREY,993,Oh my God. Is her son OK?
994,F.B.I. MAN,994,"We're looking for him. In your opinion,
why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and
husband?"
995,JEFFREY,995,"He became obsessed with her. She hated
him. He had to have her. He kidnapped
them to control her. to make her do
things. Then she wanted to commit
suicide so he started cutting off ears
as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm
not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue
velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause
her whole life was blue."
996,F.B.I. MAN,996,"You seemed to see some very interesting
things on your little escapade with
Dorothy Vallens."
997,JEFFREY,997,Yeah. I guess I did.
998,(He turns to Sandy,998,What's going to happen to me?
999,F.B.I. MAN,999,"We're going to leave that up to Detective
Williams. I'll tell you though. you're
okay. you shot a real son of a bitch."
1000,JEFFREY,1000,"Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how
many more are out there?"
