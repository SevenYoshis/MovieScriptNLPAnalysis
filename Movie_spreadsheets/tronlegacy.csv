1,AGENT 1,1,"This is the first time an Intruder
has broken into X-Net!"
2,RX23 LEADER,2,"And it's the last. Follow him!
Shut him down!"
3,KROD,3,I got a lock. Coordinate 32937!
4,RX23,4,I'm on him!
5,RX23,5,Which way did he go?!
6,RUSH,6,I said WHICH WAY DID HE GO?
7,RUSH,7,"Come on guys! Nobody hacks X-Net.
You gonna let him get away?!"
8,MILES,8,"Rush, I think I found him!"
9,MILES,9,Check the old game grid!
10,RUSH,10,"You get a cookie, Miles!"
11,KROD,11,Coordinate 6532.02!   There he goes!
12,RUSH,12,"I haven't played this since I was 4.
But I was mighty awesome."
13,RUSH,13,Score an ID on this leech?
14,MILES,14,Negative.    He's nobody.
15,KELTER,15,"Rush, you've gotta nail him."
16,PHLEGMAN,16,Or you know we're all fired.
17,MILES,17,"Whoa, Rush! I groked a pattern in
his moves! Fake left, go right!"
18,MILES,18,"You got him on the run, dude!"
19,OTHERS,19,Crash him!   Rush RUSH RUSH.
20,RUSH,20,Yikes!
21,RUSH,21,He crashed me!
22,NERDS,22,FUBAR!    Bad Thing!   Flame War!
23,RUSH,23,Miles.    Did you get a trace on him?!
24,PHLEGMAN,24,We are so screwed.
25,KELTER,25,Who tells the boss?
26,RUSH,26,Get the system back up!     Now!    Move!
27,PR VP,27,"Weather is holding. Dress rehearsal
on for 6PM. In the morning, we let
the press in for a 7AM tech set-up,
then you go live worldwide 9 AM sharp."
28,SINCLAIR,28,"Delay the press until 8:30. I'll
taking the stage at 8:50. Force a
network break-in. Then it's news."
29,SINCLAIR,29,Play that again.
30,VIDEO PLAYBACK,30,"X-Net deploys radical software design,
constructs proprietary white-hot
firewalls, unleashes virus killer
apps. Creating the most secure data
network in history. Your data can
never again be hacked, corrupted,
stolen or destroyed. X-Net is the
final solution, totally guaranteed
99.999% secure data transmission -"
31,SINCLAIR,31,"Who changed that? Who put ""99.999""?"
32,PR VP,32,"Um, that would be...    Legal."
33,SINCLAIR,33,"Change it back to the way I wrote
it. With the launch of X-Net, this
company guarantees one hundred percent
secure data transmission. If we
can't deliver on that promise, we
deserve to be out of business."
34,SINCLAIR,34,"What can't wait, Rush?"
35,RUSH,35,"Um. X-Net was just breached by a
hacker."
36,RUSH,36,"System's back up, no permanent damage,
but... But whoever's behind this,
they're good, and they're still out
there."
37,SINCLAIR,37,Identify the intruder.
38,PLEXOR,38,Identity not captured.
39,SINCLAIR,39,How did he enter X-Net?
40,SINCLAIR,40,How could you let this happen?
41,PLEXOR,41,"I do what you programmed me to do.
I am constructing X-Net."
42,SINCLAIR,42,"New instructions - find and destroy
the intruder!"
43,SINCLAIR,43,"No. We can't delay the opening of X-
Net. Disregard my last command.
Maintain construction priority."
44,RUSH,44,"System is stable again, keep you
fingers crossed."
45,PHLEGMAN,45,Any luck finding the intruder?
46,RUSH,46,Don't ask.
47,RUSH,47,"What's she doing here?    This is an
operations meeting."
48,KELTER,48,"You and Meg still, eh...    At it?"
49,RUSH,49,There was never anything between us.
50,RUSH,50,"She's Advanced Projects.    This has
nothing to do with her."
51,SINCLAIR,51,"This company's existence depends on
the flawless launch of X-Net in twenty-
two hours, fifty-one minutes. Now
somebody - some hacker, some
competitor, somebody - just proved
they're smarter than us. Breaking
into X-Net is theoretically
impossible."
52,RUSH,52,"This creep's the best I've ever seen.
He crosses platforms, cracks 128 bit
encryption, cloaks every move, never
leaves a trace."
53,SINCLAIR,53,"When you find him, I'll be sure to
hire him."
54,SINCLAIR,54,"Boys and girls, we cannot sell a
secure network that is not secure."
55,PR VP,55,We delay the launch.
56,SINCLAIR,56,"And the world assumes we've got a
faulty product. And they'd be right."
57,KELTER,57,We ramp up our encryption schemes -
58,PHLEGMAN,58,Thicken all firewalls -
59,RUSH,59,"We can't win playing defense. And
it's a bigger job than just swatting
an intruder program. Somewhere,
there's a human mind behind this
thing. We have to get to that User
and shut him - or her - down, or the
game never ends."
60,SINCLAIR,60,"What do you need, Rush?"
61,RUSH,61,20 guys for 20 days -
62,SINCLAIR,62,"We don't have 20 hours. This problem
needs to be gone before tomorrow
9AM. Come on people, this company's
future is at stake! It's time to
think without a box!"
63,RUDY,63,"At a time like this, let's seek
inspiration in the past. We should
ask ourselves: What solution would
spring from the inspired mind of our
departed leader, Flynn."
64,SINCLAIR,64,Is the QF-401 is operational?
65,MEG,65,Um...   Midway into phase one testing.
66,SINCLAIR,66,"If we can't fight this intruder from
the outside, then maybe we need to
fight him from the inside."
67,MEG,67,I'm ready to do my part.
68,SINCLAIR,68,"This company needs a hero. Who among
you is the smartest, most resourceful
and courageous?"
69,MEG,69,Who else could it be?
70,RUSH,70,"Somebody going to tell me what I've
been volunteered for?"
71,SINCLAIR,71,"Rush, you're the only one I can trust
to eliminate the intruder. But you
won't be doing it the way you thought.
Meg's been working on something down
here that's, well... Beyond Top
Secret."
72,MEG,72,"This is where Flynn worked.   And
where he died."
73,SINCLAIR,73,"Meg has reconstructed Flynn's last
project. This time it works."
74,RUSH,74,"You didn't pick this up at Circuit
City. What is it?"
75,MEG,75,"A Quantum Digitizer. Prototype,
only one of its kind. Flynn designed
it to break down physical objects
into high resolution data. Luckily,
we salvaged his key components and
back-engineered the system."
76,RUSH,76,That's...   Not possible.
77,MEG,77,"Flynn was trying to take it one step
further. He wanted to transport a
human being into cyberspace."
78,RUSH,78,"You mean the urban legends? A
computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace
a long time ago."
79,SINCLAIR,79,We think it happened.
80,SINCLAIR,80,"It was a fluke. But Flynn worked
for years, down here, trying to make
it happen again. One day a test
went bad. A plasma reaction destroyed
this lab. Flynn was reduced to ash."
81,RUSH,81,"I was never told how he died. It
was all just weird, you know, because
Flynn's the guy who hired me. But
he was strange, kept to himself, I
didn't know what job I was supposed
to be doing."
82,RUSH,82,"Then you came onboard, the company
woke up, we had a direction. It was
kind of pathetic, because by the
time Flynn died, everybody was too
busy to care."
83,SINCLAIR,83,"He was brilliant in his way, but
genius without discipline leads to
nothing. His reckless habits nearly
ruined this company... And for sure
got him killed."
84,MEG,84,"That kind of accident can't happen
again. We've upgraded the system in
ways Flynn never could. The chips
didn't exist until now."
85,MEG,85,"Hey, Jo-Jo.    Have good trip?"
86,RUSH,86,"You want her to send me into
cyberspace to catch that jerk who
hacked us?"
87,SINCLAIR,87,"The future of this company depends
on it."
88,RUSH,88,You can bring me back okay?
89,MEG,89,Ask Jo-Jo.
90,SINCLAIR,90,"Destroy the intruder by 9AM tomorrow,
Rush. I know if anyone can, it's
you. I've had my eye on you for a
long time. Score this hit and I'll
make you my full partner in this
company."
91,RUSH,91,I won't let you down.   Let's do it.
92,MEG,92,"I promise I'll get you back safely
by 9AM tomorrow. But you have to
promise me something too -"
93,RUSH,93,"You're a piece of work. You dumped
me because you said I was too much
about the company's needs and not
enough about yours. Well here we
are, the company needs their best
guy, and you just can't admit how
much to hurts to nominate me."
94,MEG,94,"This bigger than us, Rush. Listen
to me. I don't know what you're
going to find in there, but whatever
it is, promise you'll follow your
heart and do the right thing."
95,RUSH,95,Oh.    So you think I have a heart?
96,RUSH,96,I promise.
97,DEWEY,97,It's overloading!
98,RUSH,98,What's happening?!
99,MEG,99,System is losing stability!
100,SINCLAIR,100,There's been another breech!
101,RUSH,101,It's the Intruder again!
102,MEG,102,We have to abort!
103,SINCLAIR,103,We might not get another chance!
104,RUSH,104,DO IT!
105,RUSH,105,It's YOU!    The intruder!
106,RUSH,106,You are...    TRON?!?
107,RUSH,107,ARRRGHH!
108,X-TAKK 1,108,RX23?!
109,X-TAKK 2,109,But...    You crashed irrecoverably!
110,RUSH,110,"Uh, well, I'm not exactly -"
111,X-TAKK 3,111,RX23 has been rebooted!
112,VOICE,112,RX23 reboot was not authorized!
113,RUSH,113,Yow.     I know who programmed you.
114,MEGA,114,"I am Mega, X-Net Intelligence."
115,RUSH,115,Mega.     Cool.     I am -
116,MEGA,116,"A spy? Posing as RX23? Under which
register were you rebooted?"
117,RUSH,117,I'm a User.
118,MEGA,118,Detain this impostor.
119,RUSH,119,"No wait, look. We're on the same
side here. I got an ID on the
intruder!"
120,MEGA,120,"""Tron""?"
121,X-TAKK 2,121,How did he get that??
122,MEGA,122,Plexor must know of this!
123,MEGA,123,Plexor.   This is the one.
124,PLEXOR,124,You are not RX23.
125,RUSH,125,"My name is Rush. I'm a - Look, I
got an ID on the Intruder. Do you
know the program they used to call
Tron?"
126,PLEXOR,126,You are in error. Zero match.
127,RUSH,127,"Exactly. That's how he's getting
past you. You don't see him for
what he is. He's one of your own,
gone bad. Tron was a crude security
program from Encom's old days.
Strictly low-rez, right? Archived
and forgotten. But his source code
contains all the architecture of
every Encom system, including X-net."
128,RUSH (CONT'D),128,"That's why some smart User dusted
him off and upgraded him -"
129,PLEXOR,129,"""User""?"
130,RUSH,130,"People. Like me. From the outside.
People who write all of your
instructions."
131,MEGA,131,He displays random instability.
132,PLEXOR,132,Users do not exist.
133,RUSH,133,"How do we contact Sinclair?    He'll
explain."
134,PLEXOR,134,"Define ""Sinclair""."
135,RUSH,135,"You don't know? Oh geez. There
must be a way to link him into this."
136,MEGA,136,"Zero match for a ""Sinclair""."
137,RUSH,137,"He's your boss. Everybody's boss.
Outside, in the real world."
138,PLEXOR,138,"Assuming the existence of a world
beyond this, is a fatal error."
139,MEGA,139,Plexor issues all commands.
140,X-TAKKS,140,Grep grep.
141,RUSH,141,"Okay. Sorry. I'm a program, guess
I got a piece of my code corrupted.
Whatever it is, it's given me power
over Tron."
142,RUSH,142,"They saw me read his circuits. Can
any other program do that?"
143,MEGA,143,"He creates alternative data channels
at will."
144,PLEXOR,144,Chaos.
145,RUSH,145,"Yeah, I'm a little unstable.    But I
can find Tron for you."
146,PLEXOR,146,Release him.
147,PLEXOR,147,"Interface with this one. Exploit
his ability. Locate the program
""Tron"" and destroy him on sight."
148,MEGA,148,"Instructions received, Plexor."
149,RUSH,149,"I need to find a program called KROD.
He's a specialist in pattern
recognition. He snagged the last
known position on Tron for me."
150,MEGA,150,"This is a waste of X-Net resources.
You're strictly random. We will
never find the intruder this way."
151,RUSH,151,"Plexor ordered us to work together.
You can't doubt his instructions,
right?"
152,MEGA,152,"Of course not. But I am programmed
to predict all possible errors. You
contain an infinite quantity."
153,RUSH,153,Meg for sure programmed you.
154,MEGA,154,"I have no data on ""Meg""."
155,RUSH,155,Never mind.    I'm being random.
156,RUSH,156,"X-Net is amazing. It's going to
change everything. Unless one rogue
program called Tron brings it down.
Do you believe he could?"
157,MEGA,157,I calculated the probability.
158,MEGA,158,He could crash it all.
159,RUSH,159,So we're working together on this?
160,MEGA,160,"As instructed, I will interface."
161,MEGA,161,"The program ""KROD"" is over there."
162,RUSH,162,What a dump.
163,RUSH,163,Hey.    Interface.
164,KROD,164,"Three more hub cities have been
attacked by viruses!"
165,KROD,165,"But X-Net opens soon! You will travel
in total security!"
166,MEGA,166,This is the one you seek?
167,RUSH,167,It's gotta be -
168,KROD,168,Krod!
169,RUSH,169,Krod!
170,KROD,170,"Yeah, yeah -     Heeey!"
171,RUSH,171,"The best pattern recognition program
ever."
172,RUSH,172,"This guy can filter a river of junk
data and pull out the good stuff."
173,KROD,173,"You know it, dude!"
174,KROD,174,Who is this guy?
175,RUSH,175,"Miles - I mean Krod, you flew the
search engine. You ran a trace on a
hotshot lightcycle rider. The red
guy. Remember?"
176,KROD,176,"Well. Eh. I'd like to help you,
but truth is, I just got rebooted
from a big crash. There's nothing
left in my memory from before."
177,MEGA,177,This will yield zero.
178,RUSH,178,Hang on.
179,RUSH,179,"Remember, Krod? You were watching
this lightcycle duel, a red guy and
a green guy, head-to-head."
180,RUSH,180,"The green guy faked out the red guy,
but the red guy double-faked the
green guy."
181,KROD,181,"Okay! YES! And the green guy
splattered big time! It was awesome!
How could I forget that?!"
182,RUSH,182,"Where did the red guy go after that?
You didn't crash right away."
183,KROD,183,He escaped out this hidden exit -
184,KROD,184,THAT GUY!   The RED GUY!
185,RUSH,185,Did you jack his coordinate?
186,KROD,186,Tr165444.018!
187,KROD,187,"And the green guy was YOU! You got
rebooted?! They called you, um -
Don't tell me, I got it, eh -"
188,RUSH,188,Call me Rush.
189,KROD,189,"Yeah! Whatever. You're good. How'd
you do that thing with your hands?"
190,RUSH,190,"It's complicated. You're coming
with us to the old game grid. We're
going to find Tron and shut him down."
191,KROD,191,Beats working.
192,KROD,192,Hey babe.   Did I ever know you?
193,KROD,193,The old game grid is this way -
194,RUSH,194,How do I uplink to the real world?
195,MEGA,195,"The real world doesn't exist. Nobody
can uplink. These ports were for
simulation only."
196,RUSH,196,"Right... But how did those poor
misguided fools boot up the link?"
197,MEGA,197,"They stood in the center.   Held their
disk above their head."
198,KELTER & PHLEGMAN,198,"Intruder attempted another break-in.
We patched the firewall, but our
manpower getting is maxed out."
199,SINCLAIR,199,Stay on it!    Nobody sleeps!
200,MEG,200,"There's a message on your secure
link!"
201,SINCLAIR,201,Where is this coming from - ?
202,MEG,202,It's HIM.
203,SINCLAIR,203,"My God, he's there."
204,MEG,204,"Rush, it's Sinclair and Meg."
205,RUSH,205,I identified the intruder.
206,SINCLAIR,206,"Tron? Wasn't Tron one of our
programs?"
207,RUSH,207,I have a plan to crash Tron.
208,MEGA,208,ABORT!
209,MEG,209,Rush?
210,SINCLAIR,210,He'd better not fail.
211,RUSH,211,"Hey! Double points if you nail me!
Bring it on!"
212,RUSH,212,Stop!    End your routine!
213,RUSH,213,"Cease!    Desist! We're on the same
team!"
214,RUSH,214,I'm X-Net too!
215,RUSH,215,"No, hey, hey big guy, don't take it
so hard. We all have bad days."
216,MEGA,216,"He was carrying out his programming.
All I/O Ports are scheduled for de-
rezz."
217,KROD,217,"Easy, big guy. No harm, no foul."
218,RUSH,218,"D-Rezz, we can use a guy with your
raw power. You ready to be a hero
for X-Net?"
219,KROD,219,"Cool. Now I've got somebody I can
boss around."
220,KROD,220,Or not.
221,RUSH,221,Let's get to the game grid.
222,MEGA,222,"You have a skill for manipulating
other programs."
223,RUSH,223,"When do I get a shot at hacking your
code?"
224,MEGA,224,"Never. Our operating systems are
incompatible."
225,RUSH,225,You act like I've got a virus.
226,KROD,226,There it is.
227,RUSH,227,The place we nail Tron.
228,RUSH,228,D-rezz.   Cut a path.
229,KROD,229,That's good.     Keep doing it.
230,I-BEEM,230,Violation!   Go away!   Access denied!
231,RUSH,231,"Relax, buddy -"
232,KROD,232,"Pound him to bits, D-rezz."
233,RUSH,233,He's wireless.
234,KROD,234,Freaky.
235,MEGA,235,"Searching data bank. ""I-Beem"".
Security Specialist, damaged in
service, rated unstable."
236,I-BEEM,236,"""Unstable""! Like they aren't?!
They booted me off X-Net! I'll show
them! I'm doing my subroutine out
here! Nobody gets through this
portal!"
237,KROD,237,"D-rezz, take out this blip."
238,RUSH,238,"Hang on. I-Beem. We're from X-Net
CPU. You're doing a great job out
here. Everybody knows it."
239,I-BEEM,239,They do?!
240,RUSH,240,"That's right. Now, have you seen a
rogue Program around here? He's
red. Super fast. Known as ""Tron""."
241,I-BEEM,241,"The red one! That illegal function!
He blasts through here and JUMPS
OVER THE TOP! I tell him access
denied - he JUMPS RIGHT OVER like I
was never there!"
242,RUSH,242,When did he come through last?
243,I-BEEM,243,Right before you got here.
244,RUSH,244,"I-beem, we've got a plan to shut
down that red violator. You're going
to help us."
245,I-BEEM,245,Let me at him!
246,RUSH,246,"First, you've got to let us onto the
game grid."
247,MEGA,247,This region is obsolete.
248,RUSH,248,"There's bits of Tron's code all over.
Krod, give D-Rezz and I-beem the
escape coordinate Tron used on me."
249,I-BEEM,249,Coordinate captured.
250,RUSH,250,"That's where Tron will bail out.
We'll make sure he needs to. Go set
up the trap."
251,RUSH,251,"You only get one shot at this, big
guy. Stop him but don't destroy
him, right? He's got data I need."
252,MEGA,252,"If this is Tron's territory, he'll
know we're here. He'll hide."
253,RUSH,253,"He can't resist a grudge match.
He'll take risks trying to beat me.
That's how we trip him up."
254,RUSH,254,Whip it out.
255,KROD,255,You didn't bring one?
256,MEGA,256,I don't have one.
257,KROD,257,"Hey, not a problem -"
258,KROD,258,- Hop on!
259,RUSH,259,"Hang on, Krod."
260,RUSH,260,I upgraded my unit.
261,KROD,261,"You are awesome, man.    I hate you."
262,MEGA,262,Mmmm...   Hack me.
263,MEGA,263,"Resource conflict!    Fatal crash
imminent!"
264,RUSH,264,Any sign of him?
265,KROD,265,"Everything looks the same to me.
Everything looks the same. The same.
The same."
266,RUSH,266,"Krod, snap out of it."
267,MEGA,267,Tron will never expose himself.
268,KROD,268,The same...
269,I-BEEM,269,"Yes, I see. Perfect trap. This is
going to be good. Climb, climb!"
270,MEGA,270,Its futile.
271,RUSH,271,Look.
272,RUSH,272,"Remember the plan, Krod. Don't bail
out until the last millisecond."
273,RUSH,273,"Hang on tight, Mega."
274,KROD,274,Mmmm.
275,I-BEEM,275,Here they come!
276,RUSH,276,Wuss!   You call that speed!?
277,KROD,277,"Hey, what are you - ??"
278,KROD,278,No!   It's ME!
279,RUSH,279,WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!
280,MEGA,280,I-    I GOT SCARED!
281,I-BEEM,281,No!   It's Krod! Tron is OVER THERE!
282,KROD,282,There he goes!
283,RUSH,283,We've got him now.    Let's go!
284,KROD,284,I could have done that.
285,MEGA,285,We can't go any further.
286,RUSH,286,What is it?
287,KROD,287,"Don't ask, dude."
288,MEGA,288,"It's a memory leak, once it starts,
it infects everything."
289,I-BEEM,289,"Touch it and you crash forever.     We
cannot risk it."
290,MEGA,290,I agree.
291,KROD,291,Then it's settled.
292,RUSH,292,"Stop. Listen to me. You might not
believe there's a world outside of
this one, but let's just say a guy
named Sinclair is depending on me.
If Tron got through here, then I can
too. Who's with me?"
293,RUSH,293,"Good. I-beem, take D-rezz, see what's
up ahead. We'll guard this portal
until you come back."
294,RUSH,294,Better show me how to use mine.
295,KROD,295,"No problem. It's all in the velocity-
vector ratio."
296,PLEXOR,296,Report.
297,MEGA,297,"We interfaced with Tron.   He escaped
into a dark zone."
298,PLEXOR,298,The Random One has proven effective?
299,MEGA,299,"He is all glitches and bad data. He
virtually got us de-rezzed. I
recommend we terminate this mission."
300,PLEXOR,300,"No. Proceed. If you keep Tron on
the run, he cannot attack X-Net."
301,MEGA,301,It's a poor allocation of resources.
302,PLEXOR,302,You have your instructions.
303,RUSH,303,"""All glitches and bad data."" What's
up with you? Ever since I got here,
you've been working against me."
304,MEGA,304,I act as Plexor programs me.
305,RUSH,305,"Blah blah blah. You've got you own
processor. I can feel it working
overtime. Did Meg program you to
mess with me?"
306,MEGA,306,"I have no match for ""Meg"" -"
307,RUSH,307,"First, you don't want to come with
me, then you're all over me on the
light cycle - so you can dump us
over and blow the plan. We would
have nailed Tron by now if it wasn't
for you. What's your malfunction?"
308,MEGA,308,Don't troubleshoot me!
309,MEGA,309,"The most effective alternative is to
return to the main CPU and anticipate
Tron's next attack."
310,KROD,310,You ram hog!
311,RUSH,311,It's what I'm programmed to do.
312,KROD,312,What were you doing with her?
313,RUSH,313,"Nothing. She had a glitch.      I was
just pinging her EPROM."
314,KROD,314,She let you?
315,I-BEEM (O.S.),315,There's a way through!
316,I-BEEM,316,"Tron attacked us! D-rezz has him
cornered!"
317,RUSH,317,We've got him now.
318,D-REZZ,318,Akakakaka -    Agggggggg -
319,RUSH,319,Guys!   Go around - behind Tron!
320,RUSH,320,Ouch!
321,RUSH,321,Hey!   Pick on somebody your own size!
322,RUSH,322,You've got no data on me.
323,RUSH,323,"D-rezz, pull me up!"
324,RUSH,324,"Hang on, man! HANG ON!"
325,RUSH,325,NOOOO!
326,RUSH,326,"I know who you are. Encom security
program Tr856 - TRON!"
327,RUSH,327,Who is your User??
328,RUSH,328,"Who programmed you?? I know your
encryption code. Tell me your User
or I shut you down."
329,RUSH,329,"I can shut you down with a nine digit
code. WHO IS YOUR USER?? 392 -"
330,RUSH,330,"Tell me, Tron! Who programmed you?
Here's your encryption code! 3-6-2-
6-6-8 -"
331,RUSH,331,ARRGGHHH!    3-6-2-6-6-8-7 -
332,RUSH,332,362668766!
333,KROD,333,You got him!
334,KROD,334,"Game over, dude."
335,I-BEEM,335,You crashed him!
336,RUSH,336,"It's more than I wanted. Now I'll
never know who his User is."
337,KROD,337,We're heroes!
338,I-BEEM,338,I will be upgraded!
339,KROD,339,"They'll give us a slot in the main
server!"
340,I-BEEM,340,I will be upgraded!   I will be -
341,KROD,341,"Rush, now you can finish pinging
Mega's EPROM!"
342,RUSH,342,Where is Mega?
343,I-BEEM,343,She was just here.
344,KROD,344,Right behind me.
345,RUSH,345,MEGA??
346,RUSH,346,Mega...
347,KROD,347,I recognize... Trouble.
348,I-BEEM,348,They're scanning us.
349,RUSH,349,"I-beem, go for help.      Zap your butt
out of here."
350,DARK FIGURE (O.S.),350,"It had to happen. But why now of
all times?"
351,DARK FIGURE,351,A User shows up.
352,RUSH,352,"Yeah, I'm a User. A superior being.
The first to enter this realm. And
you are - ?"
353,FLYNN,353,The first.
354,RUSH,354,Flynn.   How can you be here?
355,KROD,355,You know this dude?
356,RUSH,356,"Yeah, he's a lunatic!"
357,FLYNN,357,"Rush Nortebi. I remember hiring
you."
358,KROD,358,"Somebody tipped these guys off about
us."
359,MEGA,359,Not soon enough.
360,MEGA,360,"You weren't supposed to beat Tron.
I thought for sure he'd finish you."
361,RUSH,361,Thanks.
362,MEGA,362,You destroyed our last hope!
363,KROD,363,I detect a pattern in her behavior.
364,RUSH,364,She's a spy.
365,RUSH,365,"No wonder I couldn't figure it out.
I assumed Tron User was on the
outside! If I'd known this, I would
blown past him and come straight for
you."
366,MEGA,366,I failed our cause.
367,FLYNN,367,You did everything you could.
368,RUSH,368,Flynn never died...
369,RUSH,369,"Because your Quantum Digitizer worked.
That's how you got here... I know -
that's how I got here too."
370,FLYNN,370,"The day after I hired you, you start
sucking up to Sinclair. You thought
I didn't know. Bet he offered your
a partnership for this, right? You
have no idea the damage you've done."
371,RUSH,371,"I'm only getting started. Man, you
were the company joke. Now I see
why. You melted down your lab to
take this little joyride. You got
stuck here so all you can do is wreck
other people's hard work."
372,FLYNN,372,"Open your eyes, geek. My lab was
rigged. My ""death"" was no accident.
I pushed the button just in time to
escape... Almost in time."
373,RUSH,373,"You're paranoid. Who would want you
dead?"
374,FLYNN,374,"The same guy I programmed Tron to
shut down. Same one you've been
sucking up to. Sinclair. And his
cyber-henchman, Plexor."
375,RUSH,375,"Too many of your brain cells have
gotten zapped in here, old man."
376,FLYNN,376,"Rush, you lamer! You've been working
for the bad guy."
377,FIGHTER ONE,377,He got away.
378,FLYNN,378,"Let's move. X-Net goons will soon
be all over this place."
379,FLYNN,379,"I hired Sinclair as Encom's business
guy, so I could do the dreaming.
Right off, he wanted to ""capture the
market"" on data transmission. Had
this plan called ""X-Net"", based on
flawless efficiency, hyperlock
security, encryption protocol
uniformity. Blah blah. I was the
boss, I told him to forget it. I
knew it could go bad. But the guy
had trouble taking no for an answer.
He arranged for my lab to melt down.
Sinclair took over my company and
put X-Net on a fast-track. And here's
where it's brought us."
380,RUSH,380,What are they doing??
381,FLYNN,381,Beating the competition.
382,MEGA,382,They've got us outnumbered.
383,FLYNN,383,"We've got to choose our battles
wisely. This way!"
384,KROD,384,"Rush, why is X-Net doing this?!"
385,KID PROGRAM,385,No!   Let my daddy go!
386,RUSH,386,How long has this been going on?
387,FLYNN,387,For years.
388,RUSH,388,"Sinclair never told us about this.
X-Net is creating the very terror
that makes people want the security
of X-net!"
389,FLYNN,389,"No more glitches, freeze-ups or shut-
downs. Once X-Net is open, Plexor
will destroy all other systems. All
data flow will be controlled by his
Master User -"
390,RUSH,390,Sinclair.
391,FLYNN,391,"All data flow - Sinclair's to control
and abuse. Bank accounts, medical
histories, your Blockbuster account,
your buying patterns, your e-mail.
And to think, Rush - all this time,
you've been working 24/7, trying to
impress a him."
392,GPS VOICE,392,"Turn left now. Turn right now.
Left. Right. NOW!"
393,RUSH,393,Sinclair betrayed me.
394,FLYNN,394,Finally you get it.
395,MEGA,395,Tron was our late hope.
396,RUSH,396,We've got to stop this!
397,MEGA,397,Rush was trying to expose us!
398,FLYNN,398,They didn't see us.   Keep moving!
399,RUSH,399,"We've got to tell people on the
outside -"
400,FLYNN,400,"Plexor shut down all the I/O ports.
Only HE communicates with the outside.
Sinclair holds all the cards."
401,FLYNN,401,How did you get here?!
402,RUSH,402,Megan Randall sent me.
403,RUSH,403,"Her User. She fixed your lab and
sent me here to take out Tron."
404,FLYNN,404,"Megan Randall? I remember her.
Smart, wise beyond her years. I
can't believe she'd fall for
Sinclair's lies."
405,RUSH,405,What happened to them?
406,MEGA,406,"Try to attack Plexor head-on, this
is what happens. Because of you,
there will be millions more."
407,FLYNN,407,"Lock up these two. We'll hold them
for ransom. Or use them for target
practice."
408,RUSH,408,"Flynn. You think I'm Sinclair's
flunky, but I'm not."
409,RUSH,409,I'm sorry about Tron.
410,KROD,410,"Yeah, we're - Sorry?"
411,RUSH,411,"We were just doing a job, we had no
way of knowing the truth."
412,KROD,412,No way at all.
413,RUSH,413,"Flynn, I was wrong about you. You've
been doing the right thing in here.
Plexor has to be shut down. Sinclair
has to be exposed."
414,KROD,414,Like he said.
415,RUSH,415,Krod and I are ready to help.
416,KROD,416,We are?
417,FLYNN,417,"Mega, what do you read in him?"
418,MEGA,418,Independent operating instructions.
419,MEGA (CONT'D),419,"He will act as necessary to increase
probability of his own survival."
420,RUSH,420,You don't know me.
421,MEGA,421,He cannot to be trusted.
422,RUSH,422,"Trust?! You're the one who's been
lying to me the whole time!"
423,FLYNN,423,"Mega's been risking her existence
for our cause, lamer. That's more
than you'll ever do."
424,FLYNN,424,Lock them away!
425,KROD,425,"Yo, s'up?     Eh... X-Net rules, man."
426,RUSH,426,Hey Krod...     Shut down.
427,X-TAKK,427,Halt!   State encryption code!
428,I-BEEM,428,027591748594303 -
429,I-BEEM,429,027591748594303071852!
430,PLEXOR,430,You are positive Tron was destroyed?
431,I-BEEM,431,"I observed it directly!     Rush turned
Tron into vaporware!"
432,I-BEEM,432,"Rush claims to be a User! He must
be! He is awesomely skilled!"
433,X-TAKK COMMANDER,433,Users do not exist.
434,PLEXOR,434,"He is but a randomized Program, he
got lucky. To our benefit."
435,I-BEEM,435,"Rush and Krod were surrounded by
stealth fighters! They were led by
another User called Flynn!"
436,PLEXOR,436,Flynn??
437,I-BEEM,437,"Yeah, that's the one!"
438,PLEXOR,438,"Flynn... is here? He is the one
behind this scheme to crash X-Net?"
439,I-BEEM,439,"I know where they are!     Rush and
Krod need our help!"
440,PLEXOR,440,And what of Mega?
441,I-BEEM,441,"We couldn't find her. I'm certain
they captured her too!"
442,PLEXOR,442,"Tron is gone, but his User lives?"
443,PLEXOR,443,"Good work does not go unrewarded at
X-Net. Would you like to be upgraded?"
444,I-BEEM,444,"Yes, Plexor, very much so."
445,MARKETING VP,445,You're not going to believe this!
446,SINCLAIR,446,Convince me.
447,MARKETING VP,447,"Sales office has been flooded with
calls. Major banks, airlines, city
governments, the presidents of 26
nations - They all want to sign up
for X-Net now. We're not even on-
line yet and we're a hit!"
448,SINCLAIR,448,We're the only port in the storm.
449,SINCLAIR,449,Brilliant.
450,SINCLAIR,450,What uncertainy?
451,PLEXOR,451,The User called Flynn is here.
452,SINCLAIR,452,That's impossible.
453,PLEXOR,453,Flynn commanded the intruder Tron.
454,SINCLAIR,454,You've got to be wrong about this.
455,PLEXOR,455,"I was programmed error-free.      By
you."
456,SINCLAIR,456,Flynn...     escaped?!
457,PLEXOR,457,"He leads a group who seek to prevent
the opening of X-Net. The one called
Rush has joined them."
458,SINCLAIR,458,"Rush? My guy? What lies has Flynn
filled him with?"
459,PLEXOR,459,Or what truths?
460,SINCLAIR,460,"This world can never know all I have
done. You have a plan to contain
Flynn?"
461,PLEXOR,461,Of course.
462,SINCLAIR,462,"Don't just contain him.    Destroy
him."
463,PLEXOR,463,"Instructions received.    And the one
called Rush?"
464,SINCLAIR,464,He knows too much. Get rid of him.
465,PLEXOR,465,Instructions received.
466,X-TAKK 1,466,"And whatever you do, don't let them
hit you here..."
467,X-TAKK 1,467,"All X-Net Programs have a weak spot
there."
468,RUSH,468,"Hear that, Krod? Never let them get
to your weak spot."
469,KROD,469,Gurfle!   I never knew that.
470,BOOLE,470,We're ready for you now.
471,FLYNN,471,"If X-Net is allowed to open it's the
beginning of the end of a free and
open cyberspace. We can't let Plexor
get away with this. Our game plan
has not changed. Tron was specially
programmed to break into X-Net and
shut down power supplies. We would
then exploit these weak points and
cripple the system. Tron's role was
essential One of you must take his
place."
472,FLYNN,472,"Who among you can power Tron's disk
and carry out his mission?"
473,FLYNN,473,"It's the most dangerous job. If
you're not up for it, nobody's going
to blame you."
474,MEGA,474,"There are other ways to crash Plexor.
I will return to him, he still trusts
me. I will get close and crash him
with direct contact -"
475,FLYNN,475,"It's futile. Plexor's personal
defense measures are massive."
476,FIGHTER SENTRY,476,"Enemy scouts, headed this way!"
477,PLEXOR,477,Disperse to all sectors!
478,X-TAKK SPECIALIST,478,The invader Tron crashed here.
479,PLEXOR,479,"This was a preferred gaming arena
for the User called Flynn. His moves
are predictable, recursive, easily
traced."
480,PLEXOR,480,That way!
481,PLEXOR,481,Down there.
482,PLEXOR,482,"Fan out!    Search every buffer and
cache!"
483,RUSH (O.S.),483,Hey!     Down here!
484,KROD (O.S.),484,Get us out of here!
485,KROD,485,"Dude, are we glad to see you!"
486,PLEXOR,486,You destroyed Tron.
487,RUSH,487,Yes...    Where is Mega?
488,PLEXOR,488,She's not with you?
489,KROD,489,"She's with Flynn!       I mean, totally
WITH Flynn -!"
490,RUSH,490,"Flynn was smart enough to interrogate
her first."
491,KROD,491,Right.
492,PLEXOR,492,"She contains sensitive data. Flynn
cannot be allowed to hack her."
493,RUSH,493,"Yeah, only -     We kicked Flynn's butt,
too."
494,KROD,494,"You should have seen it.       Flynn won't
be a problem."
495,PLEXOR,495,Then...   Why were you imprisoned?
496,X-TAKK,496,Ambush!
497,PLEXOR,497,Delete them all!
498,PLEXOR,498,It's a TRAP!
499,FLYNN,499,"Retreat! Over that way!     Move around
their flank!"
500,FLYNN,500,Arrrgghhh!
501,KROD,501,Thanks.
502,RUSH,502,I'll never let you forget it.
503,KROD,503,"Rush, we're screwed!    Now everybody's
after us!"
504,RUSH,504,"Nah, we're cool. We're with them!"
505,KROD,505,Awesome!    Can I do one?
506,MEGA,506,Quick.     This way.
507,PLEXOR,507,"Mega, move aside! I will finish
him!"
508,MEGA,508,"Strike us down. There will always
be more to oppose you."
509,PLEXOR,509,"What programming has he installed
in you??"
510,MEGA,510,Flynn!   Go with the others!   Run!
511,FLYNN,511,I'm not leaving you with this phreak.
512,FLYNN,512,"Plexor, get over the control thing."
513,RUSH,513,Drop the disk!
514,FLYNN,514,I'll be damned.
515,MEGA,515,Rush?!
516,RUSH,516,ARRGH!
517,RUSH,517,Is that all you've got?
518,PLEXOR,518,Raagghh!
519,FLYNN,519,Rush!    This way!
520,PLEXOR,520,Delete them!
521,BOOLE,521,This way!   Down the pipe!
522,MEGA,522,He's better than I thought.
523,FLYNN,523,He's been sent for a reason.
524,MEGA,524,What reason?
525,FLYNN,525,"Don't know yet. Sometimes we have
to trust the bigger plan."
526,RUSH,526,Mega!   Quick! Jump!
527,RUSH,527,MEGA!!!
528,X-TAKK 1,528,We got her!
529,PLEXOR,529,You committed a fatal error.
530,PLEXOR,530,"Their strategies and tactics lie
encrypted in her memory. Bring her!
I will hack from her what I need."
531,RUSH,531,"I got it, I got it, I got it."
532,KROD,532,AWWWWWWW!
533,RUSH,533,Shove it!    Go!
534,KROD,534,I remember now! Nothing to it!
535,RUSH,535,Check it out!
536,BOOLE,536,Look out!
537,RUSH,537,What?
538,FLYNN,538,TURN AROUND!
539,RUSH & KROD,539,AHHHHHHHH!
540,KROD,540,I'm cool.    Not a problem.
541,RUSH,541,They took Mega.
542,FLYNN,542,She can handle herself for a while.
543,RUSH,543,How do we attack Plexor next?
544,QUANTZ,544,You're with us now?
545,BOOLE,545,"Do you know hard it is?   Opposing
the power of Plexor?"
546,RUSH,546,"It's like the forty-sixth level of
ConquerDome 6.1, while winning a
side game of Tetras Ultra, doing six
Instant messages and debugging a
demo."
547,FLYNN,547,All at the same time.
548,RUSH,548,I'm there.   Krod too.
549,KROD,549,Say what?
550,FLYNN,550,"We're going to need all the help we
can get. Boole, can we make it to
the dark zone from here?"
551,BOOLE,551,There is one possible route.
552,FLYNN,552,"We'll meet up with the code monkeys
and combine forces."
553,FIGHTER 1,553,We gave it everything.
554,FIGHTER 2,554,Interface.   We can resist.
555,FIGHTER 3,555,Interface.
556,PLEXOR,556,Is completion on schedule?
557,PLEXOR,557,On schedule.
558,PLEXOR,558,Boot up.
559,MEGA,559,You treat me like I've been corrupted.
560,PLEXOR,560,"I cannot predict the random effects
Flynn might have caused in you."
561,MEGA,561,"You programmed me to gather
intelligence. That's all I've ever
done."
562,PLEXOR,562,How long have you known Flynn?
563,MEGA,563,Enough time to gain his trust.
564,PLEXOR,564,Your behavior was highly authentic.
565,MEGA,565,To him.    It had to be.
566,PLEXOR,566,"Have you allowed Flynn to complete a
full interface with you?"
567,MEGA,567,"I am programmed to allow such access
only to you, Plexor."
568,PLEXOR,568,"Flynn claims to be a User.     As did
the one called Rush."
569,MEGA,569,Users do not exist.
570,PLEXOR,570,"You have seen nothing to make you
doubt this?"
571,MEGA,571,Nothing.
572,PLEXOR,572,"They possess no powers beyond those
of routine Programs?"
573,MEGA,573,I have no knowledge of such powers.
574,PLEXOR,574,"Still, there is something about them
I cannot compute. Flynn plans to
attack me, doesn't he?"
575,MEGA,575,"Yes. And Rush will fight by his
side."
576,PLEXOR,576,Where will they strike?
577,MEGA,577,"Flynn does not decide until the hour
of his attack. But he trusts me
completely. When he knows the place,
I will know it as well."
578,PLEXOR,578,"Perfect. They will be met with a
final thrashing. Yes, let them come."
579,MEGA,579,"Have you further instructions for
me?"
580,PLEXOR,580,None for now. But stay close.
581,PLEXOR,581,"You came to me full of glitches and
random routines. Look at you now.
What an extraordinary piece of
programming I have made of you. I
created X-Net to the same standard
of flawless beauty. Soon, its
perfection will become all that is,
and all that ever will be."
582,MEGA,582,All events remain under your control.
583,RUSH,583,Over there!
584,KROD,584,"Those Programs think they're just
being transferred!"
585,RUSH,585,Can we take out those X-Net guys?
586,FLYNN,586,"Our forces are too thin. We can't
risk a battle that would reveal this
position."
587,CODE MONK B3T,587,Flynn!   Down here!
588,FLYNN,588,BT!    JR!
589,CODE MONK J2R,589,Flynn!   Enter. We configured a base.
590,FLYNN,590,"Good to see you guys. When did the
X-Net goons start patrolling all the
way out here?"
591,CODE MONK B3T,591,"They're everywhere now. Taking all
Programs by force."
592,CODE MONK J2R,592,Come.   There is much to report!
593,CODE MONK N1J,593,Greetings.
594,FLYNN,594,"Hey guys. This is Rush and his main
man Krod. They defected from Plexor's
forces to fight with us."
595,CODE MONK N1J,595,"We made progress decoding X-Net's
power supply encryption."
596,FLYNN,596,Excellent.   Let's see.
597,KROD,597,I've seen that somewhere.
598,RUSH,598,"It's the encryption pattern on
Plexor's disk."
599,FLYNN,599,"Good eyes. We've got Mole Programs
who score chunks of Plexor's personal
code anywhere they can find it.
These guys fit the pieces together."
600,FLYNN (CONT'D),600,"It can take a quadrillion
combinations."
601,CODE MONK J2R,601,"We just snagged the last piece, but
the battle cost us big time."
602,FLYNN,602,How many of you crashed?
603,FLYNN,603,The Teraflop Boys?     Algebrat?
604,CODE MONK J2R,604,"All that survive, you see standing
here."
605,FLYNN,605,Oh Geez.
606,FLYNN,606,Time is running out!
607,KROD,607,"Yow. I get tired just watching these
dudes."
608,RUSH,608,"Just for laughs, try putting the
circle on top of the pyramid."
609,CODE MONKS,609,That's incongruous.
610,RUSH,610,"If I'm wrong, ding me."
611,FLYNN,611,What have we got to lose?    Try it.
612,FLYNN,612,Not bad.
613,KROD,613,Good thing you didn't terminate us.
614,RUSH,614,"How do we use this thing to shut
down Plexor?"
615,FLYNN,615,"It's a copy of Plexor's master key.
We can break into any X-Net facility
and fry the power supply."
616,RUSH,616,"But once Plexor knows we have it,
he'll change the code."
617,FLYNN,617,Yep.   We've got one shot.
618,RUSH,618,"Then we should take out the power
supply to Plexor's main server."
619,GROUP,619,"Yes! Take out Plexor's central
server!"
620,FLYNN,620,"Hang on, guys, that's not as easy as
it sounds -"
621,RUSH,621,"I was inside the main server, I saw
how it's laid out."
622,KROD,622,"I used to work there!   I'll recognize
where everything is!"
623,CODE MONK N1J,623,We can take it!
624,CODE MONK J2R,624,Hit Plexor where he lives!
625,FLYNN,625,"Even with this key, it won't -"
626,QUANTZ,626,"We can pull it off, can't we Flynn?
One final assault on Plexor's central
server?"
627,BOOLE,627,Shut him down forever?
628,RUSH,628,Of course we can.
629,FLYNN,629,"Hey, the future depends on us.    How
could we fail?"
630,MEG,630,"It's almost fixed. I'll be able to
bring back Rush soon -"
631,SINCLAIR,631,"Excellent work. Unfortunately, I'm
shutting down this project."
632,MEG,632,What?
633,SINCLAIR,633,"Something came up. The company is
at stake. I can't go into details."
634,MEG,634,But Rush would have no way to return!
635,SINCLAIR,635,"Meg. I will never hold you
responsible. This is a tough call,
but it's mine. Dismantle and destroy
all of this equipment and software.
Immediately."
636,MEG,636,Well -
637,SINCLAIR,637,Meg...   I'm not asking.
638,MEG,638,I understand.
639,FLYNN,639,"It's a bummer being on the losing
team, huh Rush?"
640,RUSH,640,"We'll trash X-Net. Then we'll go
back to the our world and expose
what Sinclair's done."
641,RUSH,641,"Do they have any idea our world
exists? Do they understand what a
User is?"
642,FLYNN,642,"Programs once connected freely with
their Users. But Plexor shut down
the I/O ports, severing all links.
He controls all contact with the
world we once knew. Programs operate
on his instructions or none at all."
643,RUSH,643,Or yours.
644,FLYNN,644,"It's nothing to brag about.    We're
getting our butts kicked."
645,RUSH,645,"It there a way to contact Meg? She
can transport us back to our world.
Maybe it's better if we fight Sinclair
on his own turf."
646,FLYNN,646,"I gave up the idea of going back a
long time ago... You should too."
647,RUSH,647,What do you mean?
648,FLYNN,648,"Sinclair didn't get where he is by
being dumb. Even if we survive
Plexor's forces in here, Sinclair
will make sure we never get back
home."
649,RUSH,649,But...   Meg said -
650,FLYNN,650,"I'm sure she'll do everything she
can. It might not be enough."
651,RUSH,651,"Oh, man."
652,RUSH,652,"Why didn't you tell anyone it was
this bad?"
653,FLYNN,653,"Rush. I think Meg suspects the truth
about Sinclair."
654,FLYNN (CONT'D),654,"That's why she sent you here. She
knew you're the one guy who could
find out."
655,RUSH,655,I thought she hated me.
656,FLYNN,656,"She believed in you more than you
believed in yourself."
657,RUSH,657,"Do we really have a shot at winning
against Plexor?"
658,FLYNN,658,"We have his master key. And we have
Mega working on the inside."
659,RUSH,659,"Mega... Are you sure about her? I
get the feeling she plays both sides."
660,FLYNN,660,"Plexor programmed her to perform his
will. He's a control freak. I'm
not. I programmed her to have a
will of her own. Whatever she
decides, it's up to her."
661,RUSH,661,Sounds dangerous.
662,FLYNN,662,"Sometimes you've got to trust the
bigger plan."
663,CODE MONK J2R,663,Ready to rock and roll.
664,FLYNN,664,"Guys... Rush is right about our
final attack. If we've only got one
shot, we should go for Plexor's
central server. If we insert the
hologon key in the main power supply,
we can trigger a meltdown. Plexor
will be have his best troops standing
in our way."
665,FLYNN (CONT'D),665,"Getting past them was the ultimate
task I programmed Tron to carry out."
666,FLYNN,666,"I turbo-charged him to burn hot and
burn fast. Who else could handle
the operating code in this disk?"
667,FLYNN,667,You.
668,RUSH,668,"Uhhh, I don't think so."
669,BOOLE,669,"It could mean the difference between
winning and losing."
670,KROD,670,"Hey, I'll try."
671,RUSH,671,What do I do - ?
672,RUSH,672,Yow!
673,FLYNN,673,"Steady. It's all about giving as
much as you get. Let it become a
part of you."
674,KROD,674,"Awesome, dude! Don't let go!"
675,KROD,675,HE DID IT!
676,FLYNN,676,"Damn, look at that...     He did it."
677,KROD & FIGHTERS,677,"YES!   Excellent move, dude!"
678,RUSH,678,It feels...    Awesome.
679,FLYNN,679,"Don't flinch, Rush!   It's your disk
now."
680,RUSH,680,"Oh man, this is good."
681,KROD,681,Awwwww!   Where can I get one of those?
682,BOOLE,682,"It's for real, Quantz."
683,QUANTZ,683,"We've got a chance to take down
Plexor."
684,PLEXOR,684,"Perfect. Any three of you could
crash an army of Flynn's best. But
I've prepare for his random acts by
designing massive redundancy."
685,MEG,685,Dewey.   This your idea of a joke?
686,PLEXOR,686,Cybavor programming complete?
687,X-NET SPECIALIST,687,Yes.
688,PLEXOR,688,Demonstrate.
689,PLEXOR,689,Install yourself over there.
690,PLEXOR,690,Attack!
691,PLEXOR,691,End routine.
692,PLEXOR,692,Elegant.
693,PLEXOR,693,Where is Mega?
694,X-NET SECURITY LEADER,694,"Only you are authorized to monitor
her coordinates."
695,PLEXOR,695,Download forces. Await my command.
696,X-NET SECURITY LEADER,696,Download!
697,RUSH,697,Don't take this the wrong way.
698,KROD,698,Don't drop me.
699,KROD,699,"Yeah, I recognize this place.    I
know where everything is!"
700,FLYNN,700,"Rush, up there. See it?"
701,RUSH,701,I hope you're right about Mega.
702,MEGA,702,You.     Where is Flynn?
703,RUSH,703,We're all here.
704,MEGA,704,"I arranged for your entry. An
encryption portal has been left
unlocked. Path 4786324BXY. Do you
know the way?"
705,RUSH,705,We got it.
706,MEGA,706,Hurry.
707,PLEXOR,707,You contacted them.
708,MEGA,708,Yes.
709,PLEXOR,709,And?
710,MEGA,710,"I gave them the portal address.
They will attempt entry soon."
711,PLEXOR,711,Perfect.    We will be waiting.
712,FLYNN,712,"This is all yours, Rush."
713,FLYNN,713,Go!    Quick!
714,RUSH,714,No sweat.
715,RUSH,715,OUCH.
716,CODE MONK N1J,716,That way to the portal!
717,RUSH,717,Let's do it.
718,MEGA,718,There it is.     That's the portal.
719,PLEXOR,719,"Converge on all levels! Outside
patrols close in behind these
coordinates!"
720,FLYNN,720,Something's up.
721,RUSH,721,Keep moving.
722,BOOLE,722,Portal 4786324BXY.       This is it.
723,FLYNN,723,"The sooner Rush gets this into the
main power supply, the sooner X-Net
shuts down. And the more of us come
out of here to tell about it."
724,KROD,724,"Oh man, I think I'm leaking."
725,RUSH,725,Krod.   You'll do great.
726,KROD,726,Think so?
727,RUSH,727,"Your recognize patterns better than
any of us. You'll know Plexor's
moves before he does."
728,KROD,728,I hope you're right...     Rush?
729,RUSH,729,Yeah man?
730,KROD,730,"Are you really a ""User""? Is there
such a thing? Is that what makes
you so good?"
731,RUSH,731,"Flynn and I come from a realm no
better or worse than here... One
thing I know, neither place works
unless you're looking out for the
other guy. And we've got a word for
what all of you are."
732,BOOLE,732,Obsolete?
733,RUSH,733,Heroes.
734,KROD,734,Cool.
735,CODE MONK B3T,735,I'm ready.
736,QUANTZ,736,Let's do it.
737,KROD,737,Nothing to it.
738,PLEXOR,738,OPEN IT!   OPEN FIRE!
739,PLEXOR,739,CEASE FIRE!
740,PLEXOR,740,You've been tricked!
741,PLEXOR,741,"Mega has betrayed me for the last
time! She is with the fighters!
Find them! CRASH THEM ALL!"
742,MEGA,742,Flynn!   Keep moving!    This way!
743,FLYNN,743,"I'm proud of you, Mega."
744,MEGA,744,"I linked with MEG.     Users exist.
She instructed me."
745,RUSH,745,"Go, Meg!"
746,RUSH,746,Which way to the power supply?!
747,KROD,747,Ummmm... That way!
748,TRON,748,You're right! There it is!
749,KROD,749,And here they come!
750,CODE MONK J2R,750,Break out the toys!
751,RUSH,751,"Block this choke point, slow them
down. Can you guys do it?"
752,QUANTZ,752,Not a problem.
753,KROD,753,"Whoa! Retreat! That way!     Keep
firing! RUN! AHHH!"
754,RUSH,754,We have to get across.
755,FLYNN,755,ARRGGHH!
756,KROD,756,Wait!     I know that dude!
757,KROD,757,I-beem!
758,I-BEEM,758,Krod my friend! Who are these guys?!
759,KROD,759,"We're taking out Plexor.    You with
us or them?"
760,I-BEEM,760,With you!
761,FLYNN,761,There.   You can make it across!
762,FLYNN,762,"No, take Mega! I'll stay here and
run interference."
763,RUSH,763,You haven't got a chance by yourself.
764,FLYNN,764,"Ah, these guys are wimps."
765,MEGA,765,We're not leaving you.
766,FLYNN,766,"My body is weak, but my will is
strong. I promise, no matter what
they do to me, I'll survive this.
Trust the bigger plan."
767,MEGA,767,But Flynn -
768,FLYNN,768,GO!   NOW!
769,PLEXOR,769,"Flynn. Your moment of obsolescence
is upon you."
770,FLYNN,770,"Freedom, Plexor. It's the better
idea. That's why Mega chose my side."
771,PLEXOR,771,"If an idea is erased from all memory
banks, it can be neither good nor
bad. When each alternative has been
removed, X-Net will simply BE."
772,FLYNN,772,"Crash me. Hack me. Do what you
want. The yearning for freedom will
last forever."
773,PLEXOR,773,Nice speech... USER!
774,MEGA,774,Noooooo!!!
775,PLEXOR,775,Over there!    Surround them!
776,RUSH,776,"We plug this into the control cell,
X-Net is history."
777,MEGA,777,Let's do it for Flynn.
778,RUSH,778,NOW!
779,MEGA,779,Over there!
780,RUSH,780,AAARRGGGHHH!
781,PLEXOR,781,"Where did you get that?!   No one
knows this code but me!"
782,RUSH,782,"Your software has the biggest flaw
there is, Plexor. You can't see you
own mistakes."
783,RUSH,783,Do it Mega!
784,MEGA,784,RUSH!
785,MEGA,785,Now who's obsolete?
786,RUSH,786,Thanks guys.
787,KROD,787,I'll never let you forget it.
788,MEGA,788,We're free.     At last we're free.
789,SINCLAIR,789,"In a world exposed to increasing
data corruption, I hereby switch on
the first global network offering
100% guaranteed data security.
Flawless performance, zero downtime.
The world works hard, the world
deserves..."
790,SINCLAIR,790,X-NET!
791,MEGA,791,I underestimated you.   Thanks.
792,KROD,792,You knew she always liked him.
793,CODE MONK B3T,793,Is she pinging his EPROM?
794,CODE MONK J2R,794,I can't see from here.
795,RUSH,795,"Whoa, ouch, what?       Ahhhhh!"
796,MEGA,796,"Rush, what is it?"
797,RUSH,797,Guys!   Mega!     NOOO!
798,KROD,798,Help him!
799,QUANTZ,799,It's the way it should be.
800,BOOLE,800,"He's going back to the place he
belongs."
801,MEG,801,Rush.   You made it!
802,RUSH,802,"Like a bad cold, I'm always coming
back."
803,VOICES,803,He made it!    Rush! You okay?!
804,RUSH,804,"I met a program you wrote. She's
just as incredibly beautiful and
confusing as you."
805,MEG,805,"I know. Mega told me all about what
you did in there."
806,RUSH,806,"She gave you my coordinates.     That's
how you uploaded me?"
807,MEG,807,Yes.   Your coordinates...     and his.
808,THE GUY,808,"She's done an amazing job here, Rush."
809,RUSH,809,Flynn!
810,FLYNN,810,I told you to trust the bigger plan.
811,MEG,811,"I'd come to suspect Flynn was alive,
inside. But I had no way to know
for sure."
812,FLYNN,812,You picked the right guy to send in.
813,MEG,813,"Working down here, I became convinced
someone tried to murder Flynn. But
the only person I could confide in
was the guy I suspected most."
814,SINCLAIR,814,"What are you people doing down here!?!
Get back to work! X-Net has CRASHED!
We'll all be ruined!"
815,FLYNN,815,"Speak for yourself, Sinclair."
816,SINCLAIR,816,"I ordered you to destroy this
equipment!"
817,RUSH,817,"Hey, jerk, she doesn't do your dirty
work. Neither do I. Not anymore.
You lied to me, to all of us. You
want to deal with somebody? I'm the
guy who crashed X-Net."
818,SINCLAIR,818,"You're fired, everybody get out."
819,FLYNN,819,"No, Sinclair. I'm back. And I'm
the boss again. You're fired. Not
only are you fired, you're going to
have a lot of explaining to do to
the SEC, the Justice Department and
the FBI."
820,FLYNN,820,Hold him until the police get here.
821,SECURITY MAN 1,821,"Yes Sir, Mr. Flynn."
822,FLYNN,822,"X-Net is dead. But Encom lives.
We're going to bring this company
back to its place as the leader in
finding the next big thing. I'll
need to be free to do the dreaming.
So, effective immediately, I'm
appointing two bold, bright,
courageous people to head worldwide
operations."
823,FLYNN,823,You both earned it.
824,RUSH,824,Cool.
825,MEG,825,I love it.
826,RUSH,826,We'll take it.
827,RUSH,827,You get a division to run.
828,MILES,828,Yes.
829,MILES,829,Does that mean a bigger cubicle?
830,FLYNN,830,"Put on some coffee. You two are
going to be putting in a lot of
overtime together."
831,MEG,831,"Do you remember how, along time ago,
you used to give me a professional
congratulatory peck on the cheek?"
