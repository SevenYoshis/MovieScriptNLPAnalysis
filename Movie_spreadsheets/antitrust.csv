0,VOICE,0,"Wow. That's hard. I'd have to say
it's the day we launched Outpost
'98."
1,DIFFERENT VOICE (DARYL),1,It's the beverages.
2,DARYL,2,"Gary always makes sure we've got the
coolest stuff to drink."
3,DIFFERENT VOICE (DIANA),3,Knowing your work means something.
4,DIANA (V.O.),4,"Knowing everywhere in the world,
this is the software people use."
5,DIANA (V.O.),5,"20 years ago, Gary had an idea, that's
all he had. And now the company's
bigger than IBM."
6,VOICE (V.O.),6,It's the people. Which is weird.
7,MITCH,7,"Big companies are s'posed to be
impersonal."
8,MITCH (V.O.),8,"There's this myth that doing a start-
up is cooler. But there's no community
with a start-up. No permanence."
9,DONNY,9,"It bums me out when the media say
we're cultish, or whatever. Why?
'Cause we care about each other?"
10,MITCH,10,"'Love you too, bro."
11,VOICE (TERRY),11,I'll tell you what's not cool.
12,TERRY,12,How Gary gets this superbad rap.
13,TERRY (V.O.),13,"There's this prejudice against super-
smart people. People like Gary."
14,GARY,14,"A kid working in his garage can create
the next Outpost, the new IBM. All
it takes is a great idea."
15,GARY,15,"That's why nobody can have a monopoly
in a business built on ideas."
16,DIFFERENT VOICE (V.O.),16,"The coolest? Gary. He's like you or
me. If we happened t'be insanely
rich."
17,LARRY,17,Can we go?
18,VOICE (FROM THE FILM),18,For me? It's Seattle!
19,LARRY,19,'Starting to get nauseated.
20,BRIAN,20,Do you mind?
21,VOICE FROM THE MOVIE,21,Did anybody mention the beverages?
22,ALICE,22,Is it over?
23,LARRY,23,"They still have to give 'em
refreshments laced with mind-altering
drugs."
24,ALICE,24,You are a fanatic.
25,LARRY,25,'Gonna wait outside.
26,LARRY (AT FIRST O.S.),26,"Alice? You gotta make him do the
start-up with Teddy and me."
27,ALICE,27,"""Make"" him?"
28,LARRY,28,You know what I mean.
29,LARRY (V.O.),29,"I'm not exactly worldly, but I'm the
Secretary of State next to him."
30,LARRY (V.O.),30,"And they're all throwing this --
stuff at him. Stock options. Pay
packages."
31,LARRY,31,I'm just screwed.
32,ALICE,32,"You know what he's like. He just
wants to work on stuff that's cool."
33,LARRY,33,"You don't wanna move, do you?"
34,ALICE,34,I can paint anywhere.
35,ALICE,35,"I'd like to stay here, yeah. And I
kind of think he should be with Teddy."
36,ALICE (V.O.),36,"I mean, nobody else can follow what
they're talking about half the time."
37,MILO/TEDDY,37,"'Could be a condition-variable in
the locking code -- If it didn't seg
fault, first!"
38,ALICE,38,"Maybe you shouldn't push it so hard.
About Outpost. No offense, you sound
insane."
39,LARRY,39,"I can't help it. I feel like they'd
do anything to keep their --"
40,ALICE,40,"Anything? That's not even credible.
If he wants to go up there? To check
it out? I think you should encourage
him."
41,ALICE,41,"It's his life. But everybody's
treating him like this -- valuable
object. You're hurting your own case."
42,BRIAN,42,"He's my god. I hear he actually calls
recruits sometimes. Or is that an
Urban Legend?"
43,REDMOND,43,"Gary's running the biggest software
company in the world, Brian. He's
being harassed by the Justice
Department, and he's got a new baby."
44,DANNY,44,Milo? I'm Danny.
45,MILO,45,Oh hi.
46,DANNY,46,Gary would like to speak to you?
47,MILO,47,...Hello?
48,GARY (ON THE PHONE),48,"Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and
your friend can come up here. We've
made some amazing strides in digital
convergence. I'd love to show them
to you."
49,MILO,49,You would? Wow. When would we come?
50,MILO,50,'Think he hung up.
51,ALICE,51,"But how does he know that's what you
guys're working on?"
52,MILO,52,"All the companies know. The faculties
tell 'em. At the target schools."
53,LARRY,53,"In exchange for endowments. They
should just drop the pretense and
name the schools after 'em."
54,BRIAN,54,I can't believe you refused a ticket!
55,TEDDY,55,"My parents're already freaked-out
I'm staying here. 50 miles from
Chinatown."
56,BRIAN,56,"Well maybe if you told 'em how much
money you'd be making --"
57,BRIAN,57,You're going up there. Right?
58,LARRY,58,I think you should go.
59,MILO,59,You do?
60,LARRY,60,"I mean, it's your life."
61,MILO,61,"I think I kind of lost it. I was
just so thrilled to be talking to
the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't
know I even cared about that stuff."
62,ALICE,62,"C'mon, how often do you talk to
somebody who's been on the cover of
Time. Three of four times."
63,MILO,63,"A lot of what Larry says is true.
They just clone stuff, or reverse
engineer it, and everybody gets stuck
with their inferior version cause
they --"
64,ALICE,64,Then you've gotta ask him about that.
65,ALICE,65,It's important.
66,MILO,66,"If he's really a bully, he won't cop
to it, anyway."
67,ALICE,67,"Bully? Are we talking about Gary
Boyd? Or your dad."
68,MILO,68,"When I was a kid? And he was moving
us all over the place? I spent all
my time writing stuff on Outpost
1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the
greatest."
69,ALICE,69,"But he's not quite the same guy
anymore. Don't get your hopes too
high?"
70,DANNY,70,'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
71,MILO,71,He's pretty tight with his family.
72,DANNY,72,We could move 'em up here.
73,MILO,73,"He just likes to write code. He's
bummed there's so much secrecy and
competition, everybody trying to own
everything."
74,REDMOND,74,"Who do you mean by ""everybody."""
75,MILO,75,So -- how far are we from the campus?
76,REDMOND,76,Oh we're not going to the campus.
77,MILO,77,Who's that?
78,DANNY,78,"I think they call him the ""Houseman.""
'Cause ""guard"" sounds too weird."
79,DANNY,79,"Don't be nervous. The house is the
weirdest thing about him."
80,REDMOND,80,"It's like he knows everybody expects
him to be this worldly, colorful
zillionaire. But he's just a guy who
likes software."
81,HOUSEMAN,81,Have a seat. He won't be long.
82,PHIL,82,"We tried the big vaporware number,
Gary, it's no-sale."
83,RANDY,83,"Can we buy into their IPO? Or is
that a Justice Dept. problem?"
84,PHIL,84,"There is no public offering. The guy
who wrote it joined some freakazoid
cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this
just to run their web site."
85,GARY,85,Milo? Excuse the tie. I was on TV.
86,MILO,86,...That's okay.
87,GARY,87,"The house knows the paintings I like,
it knows my favorite music. Same for
anybody else who's in the system."
88,MILO,88,Cool!
89,GARY,89,Would you like a Coke or something?
90,MILO,90,Oh. No thanks.
91,GARY,91,"When we started, I just hired my
smart friends. That was great. We
got a little bigger, I had to hire
smart strangers. Much harder."
92,GARY,92,"Now I don't get to hire anybody. But
I know you're the guy to write
Skywire."
93,MILO,93,"You know a lot about art, I guess."
94,GARY,94,"There's a rumor going around, maybe
you've heard it."
95,GARY,95,"There's more to life than computers?
I'm looking into it."
96,GARY,96,'Once I start looking into something.
97,GARY,97,"I've only shown this to three other
people. I bought 200, we've launched
12 so far. I keep the coordinates in
this room."
98,GARY,98,"It's left over from SDI. Reagan's
Star Wars technology? They orbit 426
miles up."
99,MILO,99,Low enough to relay internet traffic.
100,GARY,100,"Among other things... We know
convergence is the real super-highway:
all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc.
linked together. Why cram it into a
cable if you can use the whole sky?"
101,MILO,101,Skywire.
102,GARY,102,"The content filer has t'be written
into the media files so bits coming
off the satellite can be read by
multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms.
Including whatever new hardware
emerges."
103,MILO,103,"It needs a more object-oriented
language. This doesn't scale, does
it?"
104,GARY,104,"You'd have to start practically from
scratch. But this is all you'd be
working on. No marketing meetings,
no product seminars. We can't waste
the time. Half the Valley's working
on convergence. So're media
conglomerates, cable companies, phone
companies. 'Can't finish second,
Milo. There is no second... Now what
would you like to ask me?"
105,MILO,105,...Ask you?
106,GARY,106,"I know what people say, and not just
the Justice Department. We clone
ideas, inflict our second-rate
versions on the world, we haven't
done anything original since 1.0."
107,GARY,107,"Do I think that's fair? No. I'd put
some of our apps up against anybody's.
But is there some truth to it?"
108,GARY,108,"When you get to a certain age, you
start wondering. About your legacy.
I doubt you even remember Outpost
1.0 --"
109,MILO,109,I do!
110,GARY,110,"Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I
wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100
in cyber-years. I look at you and
see the things that got me here."
111,GARY,111,But somehow got away.
112,MILO,112,"If my dad'd leveled with me like
that even once... The weird thing
is, my fantasy he could somehow be
like the old Gary? It's his fantasy,
too."
113,ALICE,113,"I think that's great, Milo. I do."
114,MILO,114,...But?
115,ALICE,115,Didn't you visit the campus?
116,MILO,116,"I forgot. That's why you have to
help me decide."
117,ALICE,117,No way. You have this -- destiny.
118,MILO,118,"C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny
without you. My destiny would be
dying at 20. From eating --"
119,ALICE,119,"Don't bring that up. Like a different
girlfriend would'd've let you die?"
120,MILO,120,You saved my life in alot of ways.
121,ALICE,121,"It's not just Gary that makes you
wanna go there? 'Cause it's a big
place. You might not even see him
again."
122,MILO,122,I know.
123,MILO,123,When's Brian coming for the TV?
124,ALICE,124,"Prob'ly waiting by the phone for
Outpost to call. We'll leave it for
him?"
125,ALICE,125,'Give you guys some time alone.
126,MILO,126,...You got my E-mail?
127,TEDDY,127,"And your phone messages. You wanna
do what you do, it's not a crime."
128,MILO,128,Is that how Larry feels?
129,TEDDY,129,Uh. Not exactly.
130,MILO,130,Wanted to say goodbye to him...
131,TEDDY,131,"Hey, we got seed money for the
startup! A million-five!"
132,TEDDY,132,We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.
133,TEDDY,133,"You know what's the bad part? We
can't talk about work anymore. We're
competitors! The venture capitalists
made us sign like 100 confidentiality
forms."
134,MILO,134,"Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess
we'll find out what else we have to
talk about. Life stuff."
135,MILO,135,Guess what? They got their --
136,ALICE,136,"Milo, this is Mr. Barton from the
Justice Department."
137,ALICE,137,Sorry about the glass.
138,BARTON,138,"Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a
friend. Or maybe a supplicant."
139,MILO,139,Right... What's that mean again?
140,BARTON,140,"Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with
Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart
as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell
which technologies pose the threat
of a monopoly. We need a really smart
guy to help us pick our fights. I'm
taking a shot in the dark, here. I
can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick.
I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's
the right thing to do."
141,MILO,141,"It's just -- I kind of feel the need
to do something with my ability.
Create something..."
142,BARTON,142,Like I said: shot in the dark.
143,BARTON,143,"If you see something there that rubs
you the wrong way? Do the right thing."
144,MILO,144,That took some fun out of --

gotta figure we're a major target,

160,REDMOND,160,Whoa. Lisa actually looked at you.
161,REDMOND,161,"Every geek here's got a thing for
Lisa. But that's about the biggest
reaction she's had to anybody."

163,REDMOND,163,"Heavy graphical background, doing
design-interface for Skywire apps."
164,REDMOND,164,You'll be working with her.

174,SHROT,174,"You see somebody wandering around
without ID, it's your duty to
challenge him. I don't give a shit

secret, but everybody knows it's a

betting everything on the satellites."

business, you cover your bets... I
gotta say, this is the weirdest car
anybody ever requested."

before?"

to the surface. The best-hidden
secrets are in plain sight. You know
the best place to hide a leaf, right?"

systems, Milo, they --"
224,GARY,224,"Even when I had a hand in every aspect
of the company I knew the one thing
you can never control is somebody's

something?"
240,LISA,240,...Something like that. Yeah.

theory. Some of us who got to good
at this? We were -- escaping
something."

267,GARY,267,"It scales, don't you think?"
268,MILO,268,Definitely.
269,ALICE,269,"This feels fairly grown up, I'd say."
270,MILO,270,To our new life.
271,MILO,271,...What's wrong?
272,ALICE,272,That's what I need to ask you.
273,ALICE,273,"You know you can't keep anything
from me."
274,MILO,274,"He gave me some new code-fixes this
morning. I said, ""Did you really do
this just today?"" Cause I was
impressed. He said ""What're you
implying?"""
275,MILO,275,"It's the way he said it. Just the
way my dad did, when he was caught
in a lie. That's how you knew you
were onto something ugly."
276,ALICE,276,"What would it mean, anyway? If he
didn't write it?"
277,MILO,277,"That's what I'm asking myself. Does
he have some genius stowed away? Why
not let him write Skywire."
278,MILO,278,'Not saying it makes sense.
279,ALICE,279,Milo!
280,MILO,280,I'm so stupid.
281,ALICE,281,He's your boss. He's not your --
282,MILO,282,"I know, I know."
283,ALICE,283,"If you can't deal with him on that
basis, you better get a new counselor."
284,MILO,284,Isn't that -- extreme?
285,ALICE,285,"What's extreme is what that ER doctor
said when he pumped your stomach.
Eat another sesame seed and that's
it."
286,ALICE,286,"I mean, if one little comment from
Gary is gonna upset you this much --"
287,MILO,287,"You're right. It's -- a working
relationship. Don't know what I was
expecting."
288,ALICE,288,C'mon. Let's do the toast?
289,LISA,289,Did you wanna be alone?
290,MILO,290,No. Please.
291,LISA,291,"They just pushed up the schedule on
Skywire apps. How fast are you going?"
292,MILO,292,"""There is no second place."" Plus
every time I get jammed-up, Gary has
an inspiration."
293,MILO,293,Is it like that with your counselor?
294,LISA,294,"Mine's not the CEO. He barely
remembers to take a shower."
295,MILO,295,"Right, right. But does he ever just,
like, hand you code?"
296,LISA,296,"Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway."
297,MILO,297,You're compulsive.
298,LISA,298,"Mmm-more like -- I have a little
trouble. Trusting people."
299,MILO,299,Why's that?
300,LISA,300,Long story. Not that interesting.
301,MILO,301,"So, when you were talking about
wishing people were more like
computers. Was that then? Or now?"
302,LISA,302,Then and now.
303,LISA,303,But not right now.
304,VOICE,304,Milo!
305,BRIAN,305,"Just dropped off a resume. Almost
got in the front door."
306,MILO,306,You're living here?
307,BRIAN,307,"'Thought if I relocated it could
help my case. I'm writing programs
for the local public access station.
Where any whack-job with 100 bucks
gets his own show? God, does it suck."
308,BRIAN,308,Can you help me?
309,MILO,309,"Sure, I'll see what I can do."
310,BRIAN,310,Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
311,MILO,311,'Forgot to introduce you.
312,MILO,312,I have a girlfriend.
313,LISA,313,That's great. I -- didn't know.
314,MILO,314,She saved my life.
315,MILO (O.S.),315,How's it going down there?
316,TEDDY (ON THE PHONE),316,"I've been hacking for five night's
straight, I'm really making headway."
317,TEDDY,317,"But these, like, White Supremacists
trashed my office, last week."
318,MILO,318,What?!
319,TEDDY,319,"They're in the neighborhood. They
usually hassle Vietnamese grocers."
320,MILO,320,"Jesus, Teddy."
321,TEDDY,321,"I'm cool. They didn't touch the
machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't
know what they were. So, you a Moonie
yet?"
322,TEDDY,322,Milo?
323,MILO,323,I met this girl.
324,TEDDY,324,What? Come on. Is it serious?
325,MILO,325,I don't know.
326,TEDDY,326,Did you tell Alice?
327,MILO,327,"No! I keep thinking it'll go away.
But there's this -- connection. She's
been hacking since she was little,
she had to move around a lot. Plus I
see her every day, we're working on
the same program. She's -- beautiful."
328,TEDDY,328,"A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound
paranoid, or like a pig, but what're
the chances?"
329,MILO,329,What d'you mean?
330,TEDDY,330,"I dunno. I guess Larry's got me
totally suspicious of that place."
331,MILO,331,What does that mean?
332,TEDDY,332,"Milo, geeks don't have two
girlfriends. Most don't have one."
333,MILO,333,I didn't plan this.
334,GARY (O.S.),334,What'd the girl say?
335,PHIL,335,"There may be a little less trust
after your outburst."
336,PHIL,336,"Hasn't affected his work, though."
337,GARY,337,"Nothing does. Still. I want him to
like me."
338,MILO,338,...What's wrong?
339,MILO,339,What!
340,ALICE,340,Teddy was killed last night.
341,MILO,341,What're you -- what?
342,ALICE,342,It was a hate crime.
343,ALICE,343,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
344,NELSON,344,"They trashed his hard disk, all his
back-ups. Nothing's left."
345,MILO,345,They caught the guys?
346,NELSON,346,"It's an airtight case. They found
the weapon with Teddy's blood on it
and their fingerprints. They'd been
arrested twice for beating-up Asians.
How come they weren't in jail?"
347,MILO,347,"He told me about the break-in. He
didn't seem to take it that seriously."
348,NELSON,348,"You guys don't take anything seriously
do you? That's not on a hard drive?"
349,ALICE,349,"Nelson? Your mom wants you. It's
time to go to scatter the ashes."
350,MILO,350,"I didn't know he was working with
fiber optics."
351,ALICE,351,"We gotta go too, honey."
352,MILO,352,"I know you lost all his work. Maybe
I could come down here and --"
353,LARRY,353,"You are naive. Look at your employment
contract: you can't work anywhere
else in this field for at least few
years."
354,LARRY,354,Not that I don't miss you.
355,MILO,355,Just thought his work should go on.
356,LARRY,356,"He was on the verge of something,
too. He was gonna show us the next
day. He said ""The answer's not in
the box, it's in the band."" Know
what it means?"
357,MILO,357,"It's only meaningful when you've got
40,000 lines of code to back it up."
358,LARRY,358,"Man, could he write code. Totally
elegant. He had his own style."
359,MILO,359,"Those really weird, short lines."
360,LARRY,360,Take good care of this guy.
361,LISA,361,You okay?
362,GARY,362,I heard what happened.
363,MILO,363,Were the flags for Teddy?
364,GARY,364,Had you talked to him much lately?
365,MILO,365,"Just once. 'Guess I was worried we
didn't have anything to talk about,
since work was off-limits. Non-
disclosure."
366,GARY,366,Did you?
367,MILO,367,Talk about work? Never!
368,GARY,368,I meant did you find other stuff to --
369,MILO,369,Oh. Yeah.
370,GARY,370,You've been coming in early.
371,MILO,371,"It helps. Alice said it would help.
To focus on something."
372,MILO,372,'Don't know what I'd do without her.
373,ALICE,373,You okay?
374,ALICE,374,"I miss him, too."
375,GARY,375,Milo?
376,MILO,376,"Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of
code there..."
377,GARY,377,"34,000. But they're real short lines.
'Just came out that way."
378,GARY,378,"Been thinking about the push mechanism
in the handler. And it came over me:
it's in the wrong place."
379,MILO,379,The wrong place?
380,GARY,380,"The answer's not in the box. It's in
the band."
381,LISA (O.S.),381,Milo? You okay?
382,MILO,382,Gotta go home. 'Think I ate something.
383,MILO,383,Alice? Alice!
384,ALICE,384,"Are you saying you think they had
something to do with his death? Nelson
said it was an airtight case."
385,MILO,385,"I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe --
maybe they hired those guys."
386,ALICE,386,"I can't see Outpost putting its
reputation in the hands of people
like that."
387,MILO,387,"I don't know! I just know it was
Teddy's code. All these ideas flying
in from everywhere. You know how he
says ""Any kid working in his garage
can put us out of business?"" It's
like they know what every kid's doing."
388,ALICE,388,They hack into people's programs?
389,MILO,389,"Nobody does work like this on-line.
It's in your PC, or in a mainframe.
Self-contained. They'd have to be,
like, watching people. Physically."
390,MILO,390,Oh Jesus.
391,MILO,391,It's a camera.
392,MILO,392,"It isn't a broadcast studio. It's --
a surveillance post or something.
That's why they have the dishes on
top."
393,ALICE,393,"You're scaring me. I think we should
just go."
394,MILO,394,"Go where? You can't get away from
people like this."
395,ALICE,395,"""Like this?"" It's Gary you're talking
about."
396,MILO,396,You think I don't know that?
397,ALICE,397,Milo. Why would he --
398,MILO,398,"How should I know? ""Solving a
problem,"" I guess. Or needing to
control everything. I don't know."
399,MILO,399,I've gotta get in there.
400,ALICE,400,"Even if all this were true. There're
20 other buildings. All of them filled
with computers and --"
401,MILO,401,"It's the only one with dishes on the
roof. The studio's a front. That's
why they keep postponing its opening."
402,MILO,402,...gotta get in there.
403,ALICE,403,"Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents
are all over the place. How could
they hope to hide a surveillance
post?"
404,ALICE,404,"And how can you get in there, anyway?
With the cameras and the swipe cards --"
405,MILO,405,I can't just walk away!
406,ALICE,406,"You can't just walk in, either."
407,MILO,407,"They stop the construction work at
six or seven. The parking lot's mostly
clear by two or three in the morning.
Even the early Geeks don't get there
before five."
408,ALICE,408,"Is it two? Or is it three? Have you
ever really noticed?"
409,MILO,409,"No! I can't just keep my head in the
sand. That's how I got into this
mess."
410,MILO,410,"I know how to get in there. But you've
gotta help me."
411,ALICE,411,...Whaddo I do?
412,MILO,412,So you believe me?
413,ALICE,413,Just tell me what to do.
414,MILO,414,Come on.
415,GUARD,415,"Sir, you gotta use your own --"
416,GUARD,416,Where's your ID?
417,MILO,417,Do you know who I am?
418,GUARD,418,"It's my job, I gotta --"
419,MILO,419,"The kind of stock options I'm sitting
on?"
420,SHROT,420,"Every geek has to try this once to
show me how smart he is --"
421,ANOTHER GUARD,421,"There was an explosion in a Y-sector
closet, we're evacuating the whole
sector."
422,SHROT,422,"Un-nh, can't wander around without
ID now. Just park your ass in that
chair."
423,GUARD (O.S.),423,Whole place reeks of fuckin' ammonia.
424,RANDY,424,What is it?
425,SHROT,425,"Not much. Glorified cherry bomb.
Right by the civil defense sign?
Some geek's idea of irony. I been
saying we need a camera in this hall."
426,RANDY,426,"There's nothing in this hall.
Someone's pulling your chain, as
usual."
427,SHROT,427,"Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in
my office. He was tailgating, so I --"
428,GARY,428,"Milo? Try to have a clue. Try to
think."
429,RANDY,429,That kid's the great white hope.
430,SHROT,430,I could get it out of him.
431,RANDY,431,You're not listening.
432,MILO,432,Everything okay?
433,DELBERT,433,How's it goin'?
434,GUARD,434,"Big night. Switched from tea to
coffee. Brought new meaning to my
work."
435,DELBERT,435,"Yeah? Maybe I'll start my rounds
with #21 tonight."
436,GUARD,436,You are a wild man.
437,VOICE (RANDY),437,Well. Now he knows: nothin' in there.
438,RANDY,438,Maybe he'll get back to work.
439,PHIL,439,Speaking of which...
440,RANDY,440,"Yeah, yeah."
441,MILO,441,...in a tree...
442,PHIL,442,Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
443,RANDY,443,Damn. 'Have to go back over there.
444,RANDY,444,"Be so much easier if we could walk
in the front door."
445,PHIL,445,"You don't look anything like a three-
year-old."

of the sexual molestation by her
stepfather, and of his threat to

see him if --"
459,DOJ RECEPTIONIST,459,He's not in yet.
460,MILO,460,Can I wait in his office?
461,DOJ RECEPTIONIST,461,"It's locked, dear."
462,MILO,462,Please.
463,DOJ RECEPTIONIST,463,Wait in his outer office.
464,CO-WORKER,464,"Do I make the call, or do you?"
465,MILO,465,"Mr. Barton, do you remember me?"
466,BARTON,466,"...It's -- Milo, isn't it?"
467,MILO,467,Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
468,BARTON,468,Give me two seconds with Lacy here?
469,BARTON,469,"Go on in, I won't be a moment."
470,BARTON (O.S.),470,"I'll make the call, but I think you
need to send a Fax first (etc.)."
471,BARTON,471,Milo?
472,MILO,472,Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
473,BARTON,473,Have a seat.
474,BARTON,474,"What seems to be the problem? You
look a little upset."
475,MILO,475,"I am. I am, sir."
476,BARTON,476,Milo?
477,MILO,477,"My friend, my best friend, Teddy,
was killed in Silicon Valley."
478,BARTON,478,My goodness.
479,MILO,479,"It was racially motivated. He's
Chinese. He was. And... I know
sometimes the FBI gets involved with
that. Don't they?"
480,BARTON,480,"If there's a Civil Rights violation.
But generally we let the local police
and DA do their work first."
481,MILO,481,"I -- just wanna help bring these
guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis."
482,BARTON,482,"Let me look into it, see what's being
done. Frankly, it's not my area."
483,MILO,483,"'Just didn't know who else to talk
to."
484,BARTON,484,And Outpost? You're happy there?
485,MILO,485,Yes sir.
486,PHIL (ON THE PHONE),486,"'Didn't mention he was going to the
Justice Department?"
487,ALICE,487,No.
488,PHIL,488,"Not like him, is it? To do a thing
like that without telling you. You're
not losing your hold on him, are
you?"
489,ALICE,489,He'll tell me when he gets home.
490,PHIL,490,"That'll be a test, won't it?"
491,ALICE,491,"Instead of busting my chops you should
do something about that girl. Fire
her. Or something."
492,PHIL,492,"Lisa's an extremely valuable member
of the Skywire team. We've got our
eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo."
493,ALICE,493,Prick.
494,ALICE,494,"It's almost nine, I've been so
worried!"
495,ALICE,495,What did you see in there?
496,MILO,496,Nothing.
497,ALICE,497,Nothing?
498,MILO,498,"It's what they said it is. An
unfinished broadcast studio. You
were right... I just drove to Seattle
and back."
499,ALICE,499,...Why?
500,MILO,500,Remember Lyle Barton?
501,MILO,501,"The Justice Department guy who came
to the apartment when --"
502,ALICE,502,I remember.
503,MILO,503,"After I broke into 21 -- which was
insane, thank God they didn't catch
me! -- I just drove around. Trying
to figure out what possessed me. You
know what? I've been putting my own
guilt on Gary."
504,ALICE,504,Guilt?
505,MILO,505,"If I'd stayed down there, maybe this
wouldn't've happened."
506,ALICE,506,Poor baby. You know that's not true.
507,MILO,507,"I thought, instead of indulging all
these paranoid delusions, risking my
job, alienating Gary, scaring you, I
should do something useful with my
grief. Help them find Teddy's killers."
508,ALICE,508,I was so worried about you.
509,MILO,509,...been such a long night.
510,ALICE,510,That was -- different.
511,MILO,511,...Different?
512,ALICE,512,You didn't feel it? So intense.
513,LISA,513,So you're not avoiding me.
514,LISA,514,What's wrong?
515,MILO,515,I snuck into #21.
516,LISA,516,Why would you do a thing like --
517,MILO,517,"You thought about it too. You've
been suspicious for a while. But
it's not happening in there. It's
happening in the Day Care."
518,LISA,518,The Day Care?
519,MILO,519,Can we go someplace else?
520,MILO,520,"It's easy to know who the smart geeks
are, the schools tell 'em. They upload
medical files, school records,
pharmacy files. They'd be happy just
to steal code forever. But when a
program gets close to fruition. Like
Teddy. He was almost there."
521,LISA,521,But why would they --?
522,MILO,522,"You know. There is no second place.
And what's the risk? The killings're
undetectable, they're hand-tailored,
they make ""sense."" I mean, they're
in the information business. They
have scenarios for all of us, too.
In case we find out too much."
523,MILO,523,"I'm not one of them. Not trying to
""suss you out."""
524,MILO,524,"They killed my best friend! I'm living
with somebody they pay to go to bed
with me. Can't you trust somebody
just once? I don't wanna be alone
here."
525,LISA,525,"I'm sorry, Milo... I'm sorry."
526,MILO,526,"I know why you're so secretive. Why
you won't let anybody near you."
527,MILO,527,I know what he did to you.
528,LISA,528,Oh yeah?
529,LISA,529,So that's in my -- file?
530,LISA,530,Is that my -- scenario?
531,LISA,531,Tell me.
532,MILO,532,They'd frame him.
533,LISA,533,He's out of prison?
534,MILO,534,"They're already watching you. If
they had to, they'd give him this
drug that mimics an alcoholic
blackout. He'd wake up not even
remembering his ""act of revenge."""
535,LISA,535,No.
536,MILO,536,Nobody's gonna hurt you.
537,LISA,537,...Milo?
538,MILO,538,Hmm?
539,LISA,539,"I always felt if a -- boy I liked
ever found out -- he'd run. He'd
think I was unclean."
540,MILO,540,"No, no. Never."
541,VOICE (PHIL),541,All his suspicions were allayed?
542,VOICE,542,You're sure.
543,ALICE,543,"He said it made sense that Gary's
code was like Teddy's, that that
cliché about great minds was true.
Said it was all about his own guilt."
544,ALICE,544,"Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary
mixed-up with his dad once in a while.
It always passes."
545,PHIL,545,He wasn't acting?
546,ALICE,546,I don't think he knows how.
547,LISA,547,What about the FBI?
548,MILO,548,"They've got this guy in the DOJ,
maybe others. We tell the wrong
person, it's over."
549,LISA,549,Who can we trust?
550,MILO,550,"There's always a logical answer --
you just have to define the question."
551,LISA,551,"How do you let go of a secret without
telling the wrong person."
552,MILO,552,We don't tell anybody.
553,MILO,553,"We tell everybody. At once. So there's
no secret left to protect. When
everybody knows, they don't dare
touch us."
554,SHROT,554,"No, Tony can't fill in for you, he's
not at your authorization level."
555,LEN,555,Bob? You better look at this.
556,MILO,556,Do we post it on the Net?
557,LISA,557,"There're so many disinformation sites
about Gary already. Where he has
devil's horns or they crop him in
with Saddam Hussein."
558,SHROT,558,"Could it be a glitch? Something the
construction workers caused?"
559,LEN,559,"Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen.
Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em
there may have been a break-in?"
560,SHROT,560,"Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause
I'm not in frigging Mensa."
561,SHROT,561,"I swear to God, it's that kid Milo,
I told 'em so in the first place,
but they didn't even wanna hear about
it."
562,SHROT,562,Let's run a printout on card entries.
563,LISA,563,"The mainstream media. TV, or a
newsmagazine."
564,MILO,564,"Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot
of media conglomerates. Have to be
careful who we pick."
565,LISA,565,"We could cross-reference a data base
on media ownership. But not on our
own computers. Not even at home."
566,MILO,566,Certainly not at my happy home.
567,MILO,567,"Gary, hi."
568,GARY,568,You look a little tired.
569,MILO,569,I'm okay. It's going well!
570,GARY,570,'Have a look?
571,MILO,571,Sure.
572,GARY,572,"Why did you move around so much?
When you were a kid."
573,MILO,573,"...My dad was a compulsive gambler.
Only he didn't think he was. That
applied to guys who didn't have a
""system."" ""Losers,"" who played games
of chance. He could ""read"" people,
so chance had nothing to do with it.
No matter how deep a hole he dug
himself, he'd give you the whole
speech. And you'd better not point
out the obvious."
574,MILO,574,"His creditors would catch up to him.
Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake
us in the middle of the night. Off
we'd go, again."
575,GARY,575,"What would you tell the kids? At
your new school? You had to come up
with a good story, right?"
576,MILO,576,"No. I just went deeper into the
machine. Preferred being the geek to
having to explain. Lying would've
been worse."
577,GARY,577,...Worse?
578,MILO,578,"Cause he was a liar. And I hated
him."
579,MILO,579,"""Get your head out of that machine,
wise up to the real world."" The more
he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause
if being savvy meant being like him --"
580,MILO,580,"Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless,
even now. Didn't cultivate my
conniving side. 'Not sure I even
have one."
581,GARY,581,"Don't be so hard on yourself. With a
brain like yours, you could connive
with the best of 'em I bet."
582,MILO,582,"He's buying up pretty much everything:
cable companies, baby bells, picture
libraries, museum rights, film
archives... Getting ready for Skywire."
583,LISA,583,"What about ""60 Minutes."""
584,MILO,584,"Yeah, they dig stuff like this."
585,MILO,585,"""CBS News has partnered with Outpost
Information Systems in a cable news
network due to launch Fall of 2001."""
586,LISA,586,"But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't
love to break something like --"
587,MILO,587,"Say there's just one ""mole"" working
there, like Barton at the DOJ. How
do we know he's not the guy we've
contacted? Or she? Or the guy she
works for?"
588,LISA,588,Time?
589,MILO,589,"Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake
in Gary's set-top device. That also
takes out CNN."
590,MILO,590,"""GE joins Outpost in new venture,""
which means NBC is out. ""Disney joins
Outpost,"" ABC is out. ""Outpost and
Newscorp in new deal,"" Fox is out.
Any of these places could have a
mole. Or all of 'em."
591,MILO,591,"It's like a a continuous loop. We
can go to some alternative press
place that 1,000 people read, get
them and us killed. But anything big
enough for this is a parent of or a
subsidiary to something Gary's got a
finger in!"
592,HOMEWORK KID,592,Shhh.
593,MILO,593,Sorry.
594,LISA,594,Milo?
595,LISA,595,How close are you?
596,MILO,596,What?
597,LISA,597,"He's got 12 satellites up. He's got
dishes on top of 21. He's building
this --"
598,LISA,598,"mega-network for Skywire. Let's use
it."
599,MILO,599,"We can't just assume they're standing
by to receive Skywire 12 months from
launch. I'd have to write in an aglet."
600,LISA,600,A what?
601,MILO,601,"It's how on-line services push logos
they wanna sell you. You don't ask
for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to
work on it somewhere besides my office
or my house. And then the quality of
the broadcast wouldn't exactly be
digital, that's 12 months away."
602,LISA,602,"But they'd still get the idea, right?"
603,MILO,603,"You'd have to design a graphic
interface to make the data pop. Maybe
some audio, too. To tie it all in to
Gary. How long would that take you?"
604,LISA,604,"It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a
concept, it's maybe three day's work."
605,MILO,605,"Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We
have to do this fast."
606,LISA,606,"Before they kill somebody else, too."
607,MILO,607,"Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's
house. To get the satellite positions."
608,LISA,608,You mean -- break in?
609,MILO,609,I don't know --
610,LISA,610,"And what if the broadcast dishes on
top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said
the place isn't finished."
611,LISA,611,I'll go look.
612,LISA,612,"They'll just have a few more pictures
of me snooping around."
613,MILO,613,Why were you so careless?
614,LISA,614,"I thought the worst they would do is
fire me. Who knew they took
termination so literally?"
615,MILO,615,Why were you snooping in my office?
616,LISA,616,Oh.
617,LISA,617,I liked you. I was checking you out.
618,MILO (O.S.),618,"'Think everybody in this place is
here the same reason we are?"
619,LISA (O.S.),619,"'Cause their apartments might be
bugged?"
620,MILO,620,I told Teddy about you.
621,LISA,621,What'd he say?
622,MILO,622,"""A beautiful geek? What're the
chances?"""
623,MILO,623,"I felt guilty. 'Cause I ""owed so
much"" to Alice. But even then I was
starting to wonder. Is it so great
to be so consumed by this one thing
that you let another person do your
thinking for you? If you have a
lucrative skill, it's all anybody
wants from you. You grow older but
you don't grow up. You turn into --
into --"
624,LISA,624,Gary.
625,MILO,625,"Larry used to say how the guys who
wrote the first cool operating
systems, like the UNIX guys at
Berkeley? They just gave it away.
They figured it was human knowledge,
it belonged to the world, like
Shakespeare or aspirin. 'Know what
I'm gonna do after we broadcast the
incriminating stuff? Air the Skywire
code. Then nobody can have a monopoly."
626,ALICE,626,Where were you?
627,ALICE,627,"You know you can't keep anything
from me."
628,MILO,628,"Okay, yeah. I did something naughty...
There's this amazing Comix store in
Seattle."
629,MILO,629,"To tell you the truth, I did it once
or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't
keep anything from you..."
630,ALICE,630,I won't turn you in.
631,LEN,631,Every entry was authorized.
632,SHROT,632,Keep looking.
633,LEN,633,What're we looking for?
634,SHROT,634,Any irregularity in the pattern.
635,TV VOICE,635,"Last years' party-goers pledged over
$2 million to the Museum; this year's
event promises to raise even more.
Lured in part by the chance to see
the stunning Boyd house..."
636,MILO,636,Look at this.
637,ALICE,637,What?
638,MILO,638,"Why doesn't he ask us to his party.
He's never even met you."
639,ALICE,639,"He has thousands of employees, Milo --"
640,MILO,640,"It's for the Museum. He knows you're
a painter. If anybody should be
invited --"
641,ALICE,641,Milo --
642,MILO,642,"I know you think I'm too attached to
him, but still. I am close to Gary.
And you're the most meaningful person
in my life."
643,MILO,643,"I'm going back to the Comix place,
why should I be killing myself."
644,ALICE,644,"Milo, you --"
645,GUARD,645,Hey! Get down here!
646,MILO,646,"This is a lifesaver. My PC crashed
just before finals."
647,SISTER BEATRICE,647,"None of us knows how to use it. I'm
thinking of taking a course."
648,SISTER BEATRICE,648,May I?
649,MILO,649,Sure.
650,SISTER BEATRICE,650,Forget it.
651,LISA,651,"I needed t'see it up close for a
graphic. The outpost with a dish on
top? I climbed up there to get it
right."
652,SHROT,652,Next time you ask.
653,LEN,653,'Might of found something.
654,LEN,654,"Delbert seems to enter #21 twice.
Without leaving the first time."
655,SHROT,655,Let's get him in here.
656,MILO,656,"Great. I knocked off the aglet, as
soon as I get a passable version of
Skywire we're there."
657,LISA,657,"The dishes are juiced up, too."
658,MILO,658,Thank God.
659,LISA,659,"Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke
into #21. I was in his office when
he was reviewing the card readouts."
660,MILO,660,"They know I broke in. Alice helped
me."
661,MILO,661,"Shrot's not one of them. He's
blundering into this on his own."
662,LISA,662,He doesn't know about the Day Care.
663,MILO,663,"Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty
part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't
bother with it, it's accessed by a
tunnel they boast about. You know
the best place to hide a leaf?"
664,LISA,664,"Yeah, that's old, in a tree."
665,MILO,665,Oh.
666,LISA,666,"Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody
entered the Day Care at four A.M.?
And tells them about it?"
667,GARY,667,Milo?
668,GARY,668,"I'm giving a benefit for the art
museum Thursday night. Thought you'd
like to bring Alice."
669,MILO,669,That's great! Thanks.
670,GARY,670,'Sorry about the late notice...
671,DESI,671,"""Sorry about the late notice?"""
672,SHROT,672,Why did you enter #21 twice?
673,DELBERT,673,Huh?
674,DELBERT,674,This thing's screwed-up. Look here.
675,DELBERT,675,"'Shows me going into the Day Care
that night. I never been in the Day
Care."
676,LISA,676,"One window'll be obits I downloaded,
based on the scenarios you described.
The other windows'll accommodate the
surveillance stuff you told me about.
The idea is, this works with anything,
since we can't edit."
677,LISA,677,"Same with the excerpts I'm choosing:
they'll play against any of the images
you described."
678,MILO,678,Perfect.
679,MILO,679,"How am I gonna get away from the
party long enough to --"
680,LISA,680,"You could always say you have to go
the bathroom."
681,MILO,681,"That's lame, isn't it?"
682,LISA,682,You'll come up with something.
683,ALICE,683,"They called the house to ask who's
your favorite painter."
684,HOUSEMAN,684,"Sorry, Sir, this part of the residence
is restricted."
685,GARY,685,"Alice, I'm Gary. This is my wife,
Clarissa."
686,GARY,686,"Milo, this is Barry Linder, who's
visiting from Hollywood."
687,LINDER,687,"I hate being the Hollywood guy. It's
so limiting. Meet my friend, Ricky."
688,RICKY,688,"Hi, guys."
689,GARY,689,"Barry's studio's gonna help fill the
Skywire pipeline, thought you guys
should meet."
690,MILO,690,Cool.
691,SOCIETY WOMAN,691,"He's a sweetheart. He gave 10,000
PC's to the Library Association."
692,SOCIETY MAN,692,"All 10,000 of which will be signed
onto his browser, no doubt."
693,SOCIETY WOMAN,693,And so what?!
694,ANOTHER MAN,694,Wait'll all the books are on-line.
695,SOCIETY WOMAN,695,And so what?
696,LINDER,696,"The merchandising implications are
epic. A kid's watching the movie, he
points and clicks at the laser blaster --
before the reel's even over he's
ordered the toy."
697,ALICE,697,"But, I mean -- Devil's Advocate --
won't that influence the content?
Won't the artists complain? The
directors or writers or whoever?"
698,LINDER,698,"Artists? Darling, the only art left
in America is business. You're in
Picasso's house!"
699,MILO,699,Where's the bathroom?
700,LINDER,700,The irreverence!
701,HOUSEMAN,701,You'll have to use one over there.
702,MILO,702,"There's like eight women waiting in
line. They take forever."
703,MILO,703,Please?
704,HOUSEMAN,704,Right here.
705,GARY,705,"""Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working
with you. I'd be lying if I didn't
say I find you attractive. But in my
heart I know that Alice..."""
706,GARY,706,You left my party to send E-mail?
707,MILO,707,"I couldn't do it at work cause of
security or at home for -- obvious
reasons."
708,GARY,708,You could've handwritten it.
709,MILO,709,"I'm not much good at handwriting. Or
parties."
710,GARY,710,"Oh, that's right. You're ""clueless."""
711,MILO,711,"Gary, I'm sorry if I was rude --"
712,HOUSEMAN,712,"Everything OK, Mr. Boyd?"
713,GARY,713,No problem.
714,GARY,714,Is there?
715,MILO,715,"Gary, I --"
716,GARY,716,You see what's hanging on the wall?
717,GARY,717,"I hope you know what you mean to me.
Not just because of what you're doing.
Because of who you are."
718,MILO,718,"I do know, Gary. I feel the same
way. I thought I was coming here for
a job. But it's meant a lot more."
719,GARY,719,When will you have a Beta version?
720,MILO,720,"I'm pretty close. But when I wrote
the last contact switches, it wiped
out a piece of the content filer.
You know what it's like, writing
software."
721,GARY,721,"I do know. You focus on the big
problem. But somewhere down the chain,
something breaks down. Something
gets destroyed. At first it's
upsetting. You feel you've lost
control."
722,GARY,722,"So you have to remind yourself: it's
just the process. Something's always
lost along the way to anything
worthwhile. Some little bug, some
glitch. 'Can't get bogged down in
that, you're doing something other
people could never do. They lack the
imagination, the brain, the nerve.
Let them fret about every unforeseen
consequence. You have to solve the
problem. That's who you are."
723,ALICE,723,Are you gonna tell me where you went?
724,MILO,724,"I went to see the Skywire model in
Gary's office. You know. Just to
hold it again."
725,ALICE,725,"Are you having an affair, Milo?"
726,MILO,726,"No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody,
just now. To tell her how I feel
about you."
727,MILO,727,"You know I'm clueless, without you.
You know I --"
728,ALICE,728,Just shut up?
729,LEN,729,"Get the backslash, the colon, keys
kids don't use but geeks do."
730,LEN,730,"What would Milo want in here, anyway?"
731,SHROT,731,"They know. 'Just they don't trust me
with it. So we'll get the evidence,
first, ask questions later."
732,LISA,732,Does he know you know?
733,MILO,733,"He suspects I know something. I think
he was sort of -- explaining himself
to me, in case I do."
734,MILO,734,"We have to go in tonight. I'm two
hours from a Beta version."
735,MILO,735,But I've gotta go home for an hour.
736,LISA,736,Why?!
737,MILO,737,"She called to apologize. I said I
was pulling an all-nighter. She said
then come home just to say Hi. Which
I always do when we fight, it's
suspicious if I don't."
738,LISA,738,Please don't go.
739,MILO,739,"At this point the worst thing I could
do is anything out of the ordinary."
740,LISA,740,Here's the interface.
741,ALICE,741,"I'm a mess! I got this Hunan cookbook,
since we're always afraid for you to
eat in Chinese restaurants. I've
been mincing things into teeny-tiny
pieces all afternoon."
742,MILO,742,Great!
743,ALICE,743,Look at me! I'm gonna change.
744,MILO,744,You look beautiful.
745,ALICE,745,Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
746,MILO,746,...What?
747,ALICE,747,"I know you. You're gonna run back to
work right after dinner. I want my
kiss now."
748,ALICE,748,Be right back.
749,ALICE,749,Milo?
750,ALICE,750,Milo?
751,MILO,751,Don't we have any chopsticks?
752,ALICE,752,"Oh, right. Hold on."
753,MILO,753,One more minute...
754,ALICE,754,Here we go.
755,MILO,755,Great.
756,MILO,756,...wanna savor this.
757,ALICE,757,It's gonna get cold.
758,MILO,758,Right. Wait. A toast.
759,ALICE,759,You're just afraid to eat it.
760,MILO,760,To the artist.
761,MILO,761,It's great. It's great.
762,SECRETARY,762,"Milo, hi! How was the party?"
763,MILO,763,Great! Great! Thanks for asking!
764,LEN,764,You calling Phil and Randy?
765,SHROT,765,I'm calling Gary.
766,SHROT,766,"He's left his office, we think he's
gone back to the Day Care for some
reason. Can you tell me why, Gary?"
767,SHROT,767,Whatever you say.
768,SHROT,768,"Wants to consult with Phil. Was it
Phil's idea to run the fingerprints?"
769,SHROT,769,Come with me.
770,LEN,770,Where we going?
771,PHIL,771,He's in the Day Care.
772,LEN,772,"Bob, I'm a programmer, not a cop."
773,SHROT,773,What are you doing?
774,MILO,774,You're better off not knowing.
775,SHROT,775,What're you doing?!
776,MILO,776,"They're surveilling programmers from
in here. They steal their code.
Sometimes -- I know this sounds insane --
sometimes they kill one."
777,MILO,777,"They let me break into 21. 'Cause
there's nothing in there. You know
they've been keeping things from
you. 'Getting in the way when you
try t'do your job. That's why you
never told 'em your suspicions about
me. Right?"
778,MILO,778,If you had I'd be dead now.
779,MILO,779,"You've been following your gut all
along. Please don't stop now?"
780,RANDY,780,What's going on here?
781,SHROT,781,Who're these guys?
782,RANDY,782,Where is he?
783,SHROT,783,We're too late. Take a look.
784,SHROT,784,"What's in here worth taking, anyway?"
785,RANDY,785,He must be out there still --
786,SHROT,786,"Forget about it. His car's not in
the lot, he's gone!"
787,VOICE,787,Hey!
788,DESI,788,Wanna get a cheeseburger or something?
789,MILO,789,Maybe another time.
790,RANDY,790,"Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to
leave here now."
791,SHROT,791,"Wait a second. I'm the one who found
out he was mucking around in here in
the first place."
792,RANDY,792,"We're all grateful for that. Really.
Go out the way you came in?"
793,MILO,793,Meet me at the other location.
794,LISA (V.O.),794,"Tell me you're not calling on your
car phone?!"
795,MILO (V.O.),795,"They know, I had no choice. Get out
of the house now! Do you have a
laptop?"
796,LISA (ON THE PHONE),796,"It's three years old, it --"
797,MILO (ON THE PHONE),797,Bring it to the other location.
798,LISA,798,But you said the other --
799,PHIL,799,"Yeah, alright."
800,PHIL,800,"He's off campus, he's taken some
surveillance data with him."
801,PHIL,801,"She's bringing her laptop, it's wired.
Second she boots up, we're on 'em."
802,RENT-A-GUARD,802,Help you?
803,MILO,803,Brian here? Brian Bissel?
804,RENT-A-GUARD,804,Who wants to see him?
805,RANDY,805,Nothing. They haven't booted-up yet.
806,MILO,806,"This is the biggest Beta demo in
like the history of software. You'd
be my partner."
807,BRIAN,807,"You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our
biggest show."
808,MILO,808,"Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't
you? That's your dream in life."
809,BRIAN,809,Will I get to work for Outpost?
810,MILO,810,"No. But you can write your own ticket
in the Valley after this. We're gonna
bring down Outpost."
811,BRIAN,811,What?
812,MILO,812,What'd they ever do for you?
813,BRIAN,813,Okay.
814,MILO,814,"Great. Great! We need to drag a lot
of heavy stuff in front of the door --"
815,BRIAN,815,What?!
816,MILO,816,Wanna be a part of history?
817,RENT-A-GUARD,817,Not really.
818,MILO,818,"Well -- would you like to pick up an
extra -- 232 dollars?"
819,PHIL,819,"Nothing yet, Gary..."
820,RANDY,820,We've got a fix on 'em.
821,RANDY,821,218 North Jericho Road.
822,RANDY,822,Public access TV station. KNQR.
823,PHIL,823,"He's taken it to the public access
station."
824,GARY,824,That's what he was doing in here.
825,PHIL,825,Gary?
826,GARY,826,"Help me change the Skywire settings.
Add five degrees to each satellite
coordinate."
827,PHIL,827,"Gary, don't worry, we --"
828,GARY,828,Just do what I'm asking!
829,BRIAN,829,You're interfaced with our dish.
830,MILO,830,Gimme the coordinates?
831,LISA,831,"Longitude 77 degrees, 03 minutes, 58
seconds East."
832,LISA,832,"Latitude 38 degrees, 55 minutes, 14
seconds South."
833,PHIL,833,19 seconds South. Altitude 431 Miles.
834,BRIAN,834,Is it your software?
835,MILO,835,Is it your dish?
836,LISA,836,Maybe it's the satellite.
837,MILO,837,Let's try #2.
838,GARY,838,"Okay, #2."
839,PHIL,839,Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
840,LISA,840,"They're already here. My laptop must
be wired!"
841,BRIAN,841,Milo?
842,MILO,842,We're there.
843,MILO,843,Damn!
844,LISA,844,You checked your connections?
845,BRIAN,845,Yes! Should you reboot?
846,MILO,846,...He knows.
847,LISA,847,What?
848,MILO,848,"He's been altering the coordinates
since we logged on. He's a step ahead.
Let's jump to #12."
849,PHIL,849,Ready for number three?
850,GARY,850,Let's go.
851,PHIL,851,Longitude 109 --
852,GARY,852,Wait... He knows.
853,PHIL,853,What?
854,GARY,854,"'Knows I'm altering the coordinates.
Let's jump to #12."
855,PHIL,855,Gary?
856,GARY,856,Just do it.
857,GUNTHER,857,Step aside. We won't hurt you.
858,LISA,858,Latitude 47 degrees.
859,MILO,859,Wait a second. He knows I know.
860,BRIAN,860,What?!
861,MILO,861,"He's working backwards, too."
862,MILO,862,Let's do number five?
863,LISA,863,Longitude 66.
864,LISA,864,Come now. They've got guns!
865,GUNTHER (O.S.),865,"Open the door, Milo!"
866,BRIAN,866,You there yet?
867,MILO,867,One more second.
868,BRIAN,868,"Hey, hey, relax, relax!"
869,LISA,869,Oh my God.
870,BRIAN,870,Should I call Phil? Or do you?
871,BRIAN,871,"Milo? Wake up. Our regular programming
will not be preempted tonight."
872,GUNTHER,872,Wait.
873,BRIAN,873,...When did you know?
874,MILO,874,"You should've called a few times to
bug me about your job prospects."
875,LISA,875,Milo? Who's got Skywire?
876,PHIL,876,"If Milo didn't launch Skywire, who
did?"
877,SHROT,877,"Now what are we doing? I don't get
any of this shit!"
878,LEN,878,"I launched Skywire. Just pray the
last set of coordinates Milo sent me
connected us to Gary's satellite."
879,GARY'S VOICE OVER,879,"Most of us who write software achieve
our greatest work before age 30. As
I grow older I know how important it
is to access fertile young minds!"
880,RIMAN,880,You know the scenario for this.
881,MILO,881,"'Last thing you wanna do is hurt us
now."
882,MILO,882,Right?
883,GUNTHER,883,Who's seeing this?
884,BRIAN,884,Who isn't?
885,GARY'S VOICE OVER,885,"We work hard to stay ahead because
we know any kid working in his garage
can put us out of business."
886,GARY'S VOICE OVER,886,"The first rule of the software
business is: those who don't innovate
are doomed to die."
887,GARY'S VOICE OVER,887,"That's why we work so hard to invent
or acquire great new applications.
Consumers don't care where new ideas
come from, just so long as they're
offered at competitive prices. Isn't
that what the free market's about?
Sure, we like being #1, but it's
pressure, too. This business is
binary: you're a zero or a one."
888,JUSTICE DEPT. LAWYER,888,"'Guess we should wake the Attorney
General."
889,GARY'S VOICE OVER,889,"I've been called ""aggressive"" but to
me, that's really a compliment."
890,GARY'S VOICE OVER,890,"Look at all the jobs and technologies
my ""aggression"" has created."
891,BARTON'S WIFE (O.S.),891,Lyle? Phone for you.
892,GARY'S VOICE OVER,892,"We really are a family here at
Outpost."
893,GARY'S VOICE OVER,893,"I think that's why outsiders sometimes
sees us as ""cultish"" or ""secretive.""
Milo, It wasn't so bad, really."
894,GARY'S VOICE OVER,894,"Is loyalty and group spirit somehow
""sinister"" nowadays?"
895,LAWYER,895,"The ""murder"" stuff is all innuendo:
bad PR, legally null. 'Could probably
be spun as Urban Legend. There is a
case for corporate espionage, but if
you cop a plea, you'll get a slap --"
896,GARY,896,"Cop a plea? I'm confused, Ted. You
think I knew about this?"
897,GARY,897,"I'm running the company, fighting
the DOJ, raising a family. Randy and
Phil obviously overreacted. To this
endless, antitrust witchhunt."
898,LAWYER,898,"The government's gonna offer 'em a
helluva deal to tie you into this.
Whether you knew about it or not."
899,LAWYER 2,899,"Randy, Phil and whoever else knew
about it."
900,GARY,900,That won't be a problem.
901,GARY (O.S.),901,"As for PR, Skywire'll take care of
all that."
902,GARY,902,"The world's seen it now. They know
it's gonna dominate the convergence
market even beyond how Outpost '98
dominates the desktop."
903,GARY (O.S.),903,"Go after us, you give foreign
competitors a shot at the platform
that'll hold sway for 30 years: you
threaten not just our chip and PC
partners like when you came after
the browser."
904,GARY,904,"You threaten TV networks, phone
companies, catalog outlets, publishing
houses, movie studios, travel agents,
airlines, stock brokerages -- you
sabotage the whole economy. Talk
about undermining innovation!"
905,LAWYER 2,905,"Easy to spin, old as the hills: What's
good for Outpost is good for America."
906,MILO,906,"Come on, Bob. Load in the other disk."
907,GARY,907,"""I had no knowledge of these
activities, but I have to ask myself
if the competitive environment I
encouraged in some small way
contributed --"""
908,LAWYER,908,Gary?
909,CYBER PUNDIT (OVER BLACK),909,"The Board ousted Gary Boyd as
Chairman, they're assisting the DOJ
in the breakup of Outpost into
divisions."
910,LARRY KING (ON TV),910,"That's gotta kill him, right?"
911,CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV),911,"Outpost was his baby, sure. On the
other hand, we just learned Gary
Boyd owns the Skywire satellites.
Personally."
912,LARRY KING (ON TV),912,Outpost doesn't own em.
913,CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV),913,"Conglomerates're lined up to finance
the launch of the remaining
satellites. They'll pay him a huge
premium to get on-line."
914,LARRY KING,914,"That'd change with a criminal
indictment."
915,CYBER PUNDIT,915,"There's no hard evidence he knew
about this. Anybody who could
implicate him seems to've vanished."
916,LARRY KING (ON TV),916,"Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling
this guy?"
917,CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV),917,"Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you
some slack in this world."
918,LARRY KING (ON TV),918,"And the kid who wrote Skywire --
then gave it away? They're calling
him the digital Robin Hood."
919,CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV),919,Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
920,LARRY KING (ON TV),920,We tried!
921,CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV),921,"You better believe everybody's trying
to sign him up."
922,MILO,922,"Larry, Lisa."
923,LARRY,923,"Your app kind of blew mine out of
the water."
924,MILO,924,We'll come up with the next big thing.
925,LARRY,925,...You wanna work -- here?
926,MILO,926,Got out of my other commitment.
927,LARRY,927,May I?
928,MILO,928,"Hey, wait!"
929,MILO,929,Not giving everything away.
930,LARRY,930,C'mon. Bring your stuff.
931,LARRY,931,"You guys'll be using Teddy's old
space, is that okay?"
932,MILO,932,Cool.
