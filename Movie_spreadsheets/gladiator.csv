0,COMMODUS,0,Do you think he's really dying?
1,LUCILLA,1,He's been dying for ten years.
2,COMMODUS,2,I think he's really dying this time.
3,COMMODUS,3,He has to be bled every night now.
4,LUCILLA,4,How do you know that?
5,COMMODUS,5,I've been so informed.
6,COMMODUS,6,"If he weren't really dying he
wouldn't have sent for us."
7,LUCILLA,7,Maybe he just misses us.
8,COMMODUS,8,"And the Senators.  He wouldn't have
summoned them if --"
9,LUCILLA,9,"Peace, Commodus.  After two weeks on
the road your incessant scheming is
hurting my head."
10,COMMODUS,10,"The first thing I shall do is honor
him with games worthy of his
majesty."
11,LUCILLA,11,"The first thing I shall do is have a
hot bath."
12,COMMODUS,12,Why have we stopped?
13,PRAETORIAN GUARD MEMBER,13,"We're here, sir."
14,COMMODUS,14,Where is my father?
15,SOLDIER #1,15,"He's at the front, sir."
16,COMMODUS,16,Is the battle won?
17,SOLDIER #1,17,"Don't know, sir.  They've been gone
for eight days."
18,COMMODUS,18,"My sister wants a bath, take her to
the camp."
19,COMMODUS,19,Take me to my father.
20,LUCILLA,20,"Civilization at last.  Gods preserve
us."
21,TITUS,21,"You would do as well to read the
mind of a rhinoceros."
22,QUINTUS,22,"These barbarians would rather drown
in blood than yield an inch.  If I
didn't hate them so much I would
admire them."
23,TITUS,23,They simply will not surrender.
24,MAXIMUS,24,"A people should know when they are
conquered."
25,MAXIMUS,25,"At the first signal release the
catapults.  We'll use the cavalry to
cut off the retreat."
26,QUINTUS,26,"General, I don't recommend that.
Our cavalry might be caught in the
flames."
27,MAXIMUS,27,"I hope not, because I'm going to be
leading them."
28,MAXIMUS,28,"Why don't they know they're already
dead?"
29,QUINTUS,29,Now!
30,MAXIMUS,30,Hold steady... steady...
31,MAXIMUS,31,Steady...
32,MAXIMUS,32,Brothers -- I salute you!  For Rome!
33,MAXIMUS,33,Caesar.
34,MARCUS,34,"Maximus, you prove your valor again.
Let us hope for the final time here."
35,MAXIMUS,35,"I don't think there's anyone left to
fight."
36,MARCUS,36,"There are always people left to
fight..."
37,MARCUS,37,"But this night, at least, Germania
is at last defeated... What will you
do now, my friend?"
38,MAXIMUS,38,"Should Caesar permit, I'll go home.
I've been away too long.  I've
forgotten my wife's face and I
barely know my son."
39,GERMAN PRISONER,39,"THIS BLOOD MEANS NOTHING, CONQUEROR!"
40,MARCUS,40,Stop...
41,MARCUS,41,... You speak our language?
42,GERMAN PRISONER,42,"You have been in my homeland for
twelve years.  Of course I speak
your language.  So did my son, who
you murdered.  So did my daughter,
who you raped."
43,MAXIMUS,43,"Come, Caesar..."
44,MARCUS,44,No.  Let him speak...
45,MARCUS,45,"... I am Rome, what would you say to
me?"
46,GERMAN PRISONER,46,"You are that sun, Rome, and your
time is over... You can slit a
thousand throats here, and you can
put a thousand babies to the sword,
but it will always be our home."
47,MARCUS,47,Now it is Rome.
48,GERMAN PRISONER,48,"It will never be Rome.  Not as long
as one German breathes."
49,MARCUS,49,"No... Release him.  Give him safe
passage.  Let him go to his family."
50,MARCUS,50,"Tell me again, Maximus, why are we
here?"
51,MAXIMUS,51,"For the glory of the empire, sire."
52,MARCUS,52,Yes.  I remember.
53,MAXIMUS,53,"They honor you, Caesar."
54,MARCUS,54,"I don't think they're standing for
me, Maximus.  They honor you."
55,COMMODUS,55,Have I missed it?
56,COMMODUS,56,Have I missed the battle?
57,MARCUS,57,"You've missed the war.  We're done
here."
58,COMMODUS,58,"Father.  Congratulations.  I shall
sacrifice a thousand doves to honor
your triumph."
59,MARCUS,59,"Spare the doves and honor Maximus,
he won the battle."
60,COMMODUS,60,"General, Rome salutes you and I
embrace you as a brother."
61,MAXIMUS,61,Highness.
62,COMMODUS,62,"Your Spaniards seem invincible.  May
the Gods favor the Felix Regiment
now and always..."
63,COMMODUS,63,"Here, Father, take my arm."
64,MARCUS,64,Where's your sister?
65,COMMODUS,65,"She's at the camp.  She had no
desire to see the gore of the
battlefield."
66,MARCUS,66,"Lucilla would eat every corpse here
if it brought her one step closer to
the throne."
67,MAXIMUS,67,"Caesar, you do the lady injustice."
68,MARCUS,68,"It's a foolish old cobra who doesn't
recognize his own off-spring..."
69,MARCUS,69,I think... I should ride now.
70,MARCUS,70,So much for the glory of Rome.
71,COMMODUS,71,He's dying.
72,COMMODUS,72,Poor old man.
73,MAXIMUS,73,"If you'll excuse me, Highness."
74,MAXIMUS,74,"What, Gallus, losing your other
hand?"
75,GALLUS,75,"Aye, General, they're going to make
a bronze one for it.  Long fingers
this time."
76,MAXIMUS,76,"And the women of your village will
crave your touch even more."
77,GALLUS,77,"Ah, then you know the women of my
village."
78,MAXIMUS,78,"What's your name, son?"
79,VALERIUS,79,"Valerius, General."
80,MAXIMUS,80,The name suits you.
81,VALERIUS,81,Why am I dying?
82,MAXIMUS,82,"You're dying because you love Rome,
as I do."
83,VALERIUS,83,I've never been to Rome.
84,MAXIMUS,84,"Neither have I.  Rome for us lives
here..."
85,MAXIMUS,85,"... it's a thing inside us that came
from our ancestors and that we give
to our children."
86,VALERIUS,86,"It must be glorious, Rome.  I've
only seen pictures.  Is it a
glorious place?"
87,MAXIMUS,87,"Yes, it's a glorious place."
88,VALERIUS,88,It must be.
89,FALCO,89,"Hail, Marcus Aurelius."
90,MARCUS,90,"Stand up, Senators.  That unfamiliar
posture doesn't suit you."
91,GAIUS,91,"We live in supplication to your
glory."
92,MARCUS,92,"All the while conspiring with that
fat man in Rome.  How is the old
monster?"
93,GAIUS,93,"Senator Gracchus is hale, sire."
94,MARCUS,94,Still damning me to the four winds?
95,GAIUS,95,"Still eager for your triumphant
return to Rome, Caesar."
96,MARCUS,96,"I would have silenced him decades
ago -- but I just like him too much."
97,MAXIMUS,97,"If you want to stay on, I support
you.  So do the men.  I'll ask the
Emperor to appoint you in my place."
98,TITUS,98,"It won't be the Felix Regiment
without you."
99,MAXIMUS,99,"I'll return after a season at home.
Maybe two."
100,QUINTUS,100,"That means after three or four more
babies."
101,TITUS,101,"And you'll be too fat from Vibia's
cooking to get on your horse by
then."
102,MAXIMUS,102,"Should the Gods so bless me.  I
would be thankful."
103,COMMODUS,103,"Hail, warriors.  My congratulations."
104,TITUS AND QUINTUS,104,Highness.
105,COMMODUS,105,"My old friend, my father tells me
you're returning to Spain?"
106,MAXIMUS,106,Yes.
107,COMMODUS,107,"A pity.  I'll need men like you in
my army..."
108,COMMODUS,108,"There are larger division that might
appeal to you.  Even the Praetorian
Guard.  You've never been to Rome.
Imagine arriving as head of the
Praetorians!  They have really
splendid uniforms."
109,MAXIMUS,109,I'm going home.
110,GAIUS,110,"... And why not apply for entry to
the Senate?"
111,FALCO,111,"A war hero with a handsome face and
a strong heart could go far."
112,COMMODUS,112,"General Maximus, may I present
Senators Gaius and Falco.  Beware of
this Gaius, he'll pour a honeyed
potion in your ear and you'll wake
up one day and all you'll say is
""Republic, Republic, Republic..."""
113,FALCO,113,Have you never considered Rome?
114,MAXIMUS,114,No.
115,COMMODUS,115,"You've had my ear since we were
children.  You could be a valuable
ally in the Senate."
116,GAIUS,116,Are you a believer in Republicanism?
117,COMMODUS,117,There -- I warned you.
118,MAXIMUS,118,"I'm a soldier, not a politician."
119,GAIUS,119,"If your heart lies with the people,
I would back you for the Senate.
I'm sure Gracchus would as well."
120,COMMODUS,120,"Not a word about that sodomite
bastard."
121,GAIUS,121,"The august Senator Gracchus has been
rather a gadfly on the flesh of the
imperial family."
122,FALCO,122,He's a damned provocateur.
123,GAIUS,123,"He lives under the antiquated
assumption that the Senate should
represent the people with vigor."
124,COMMODUS,124,"I won't tolerate it.  His incessant
criticism exhausts me.  The man can
speak for five hours without taking
a breath."
125,GAIUS,125,"He serves Rome best when he serves
it with honesty."
126,COMMODUS,126,"Enough... Maximus, I would like to
inspect the Felix Regiment at dawn.
Please arrange it."
127,MAXIMUS,127,I can't do that.
128,COMMODUS,128,Excuse me?
129,MAXIMUS,129,"My men have been fighting for five
solid days.  They're too busy dying
to go on dress parade."
130,COMMODUS,130,"Of course, how foolish of me.  Some
other time..."
131,COMMODUS,131,Caesar retires early tonight.
132,MARCUS,132,If only you had been born a man...
133,LUCILLA,133,Father.
134,MARCUS,134,What a Caesar you would have made.
135,LUCILLA,135,You're right.
136,MARCUS,136,"I think you would have been strong.
I wonder if you would have been
just?"
137,LUCILLA,137,"I would have been what you taught me
to be."
138,MARCUS,138,"Well, pretend to be my loving
daughter tonight and walk with me to
my chamber."
139,MARCUS,139,"This is a pleasant fiction, isn't
it?"
140,MAXIMUS,140,Caesar.
141,MARCUS,141,Read this.
142,MAXIMUS,142,"I never acquired the art, sir."
143,MARCUS,143,"Of course.  No matter.  In this
letter I denote my intention to
nominate you to stand for the
Emperorship after my death."
144,MARCUS,144,"My son is not a moral man.  You have
known this since you were young.  He
cannot rule."
145,MAXIMUS,145,"Caesar, I am honored but --"
146,MARCUS,146,"For twenty years I have been
spilling blood.  For twenty years I
have written philosophy and
ruminated and conquered.  Since I
became Caesar I have only had four
years without war.  Four years of
peace in twenty.  So perhaps I can
be... forgiven."
147,MARCUS,147,"While I have been fighting, Rome has
grown mad and corpulent and
diseased.  I did this.  And now I
shall make it right."
148,MAXIMUS,148,"Sire, you brought the light of the
Gods to barbarian darkness.  You
brought civilization and justice to
the farthest --"
149,MARCUS,149,"I have brought the sword -- nothing
more!  Rome is far away and we
shouldn't be here.  What matter is
it to the Gods if we subdue one more
tribe of Parthians or Gauls?  What
matter is it to Rome if a thousand
more barbarians bend to our lash?"
150,MARCUS,150,"Winter, Maximus.  It's winter now..."
151,MARCUS,151,"There was a dream that was Rome.  I
can only whisper of it now.
Anything more than a whisper and the
dream vanishes.  It's so... fragile.
The true glory of Rome is in a very
fragile idea.  Imagine a place
devoted to the rights of the
citizen.  Where every free man has a
voice.  That was the dream... And I
fear it will not survive the winter."
152,MARCUS,152,"Let's just whisper here, you and I."
153,MAXIMUS,153,"Yes, Caesar."
154,MARCUS,154,"If the dream is ever to live again
the people must have a true voice.
The voice I took from them.  That
all the Caesars took from them, bit
by bit, conquest by conquest.  And
now that I am dying I am going to
give them that voice again."
155,MAXIMUS,155,You're not dying.
156,MARCUS,156,"I am, Maximus.  It's strange... I
find as I near the end I think
little of the waning moments around
me... instead I think much of the
past... and of the future.  How will
the world speak my name in years to
come?  Will I be known as the
philosopher?  The warrior?  The
tyrant?  Or will there be a more
golden sounding to my name?  Will I
be the Emperor who gave Rome back
her freedom?"
157,MARCUS,157,"Before I die I will give the people
this final gift.  I will give them
the Senate reborn.  The voice of the
people empowered again, as it was
always meant to be.  It is my design
that they will elect the next
Emperor.  And I would put forward
your name with my backing."
158,MAXIMUS,158,"Caesar, you do me honor -- but your
son has pride of place for
succession."
159,MARCUS,159,"You are the son I should have had...
Although I fear in my deepest heart
that if you had truly been my son my
blood would have polluted you as it
did Commodus.  We're a cursed
bloodline.  We have lived so long in
power and depravity that we no
longer remember a life without it.
We can no longer even imagine a life
without it."
160,MARCUS,160,"Look at me, son."
161,MARCUS,161,"Son... I know that one grove of your
vineyard is worth more to you than
all the treasures of Rome.  I know
one loving word from your wife is
worth more than the accolades of an
Empire.  But... a fond old man, who
loves you more than he can say, begs
you to at least think about what he
has said tonight."
162,MAXIMUS,162,"I shall, Caesar."
163,MARCUS,163,"I'll keep this letter to myself.  I
hope that with the sunrise you will
agree.  And embrace me as a father."
164,MAXIMUS,164,You have always been my father.
165,LUCILLA'S VOICE,165,He always favored you...
166,LUCILLA,166,Even over his son.
167,MAXIMUS,167,That's not true.
168,LUCILLA,168,"Maximus, stop..."
169,LUCILLA,169,Let me see your face.
170,LUCILLA,170,You've been crying.
171,MAXIMUS,171,I lost too many men.
172,LUCILLA,172,What does my father intend?
173,MAXIMUS,173,I don't know.
174,LUCILLA,174,"You're lying.  I could tell when you
were lying even when we were
children.  You hate it."
175,MAXIMUS,175,"I never acquired your comfort with
it."
176,LUCILLA,176,"True.  But then you never had to.
Maximus, stop..."
177,LUCILLA,177,"... Is it really so terrible seeing
me again?"
178,MAXIMUS,178,"No.  I'm sorry.  I'm tired from the
battle."
179,LUCILLA,179,"And you are hurt to see my father
dying."
180,LUCILLA,180,"He will announce Commodus'
succession.  That's why he summoned
us.  Will you serve my brother as
you served his father?"
181,MAXIMUS,181,"I will always serve the ideals of
Rome."
182,LUCILLA,182,"Do you know I still remember you in
my prayers...?  Oh yes, I pray...
Ever since that day you saved me
from drowning off Capri.  Do you
remember?"
183,MAXIMUS,183,Yes.
184,LUCILLA,184,"Commodus was so angry that a mere
peasant -- a Spaniard no less --
touched the royal person, do you
remember his anger?"
185,MAXIMUS,185,Yes.
186,LUCILLA,186,"Mark this, Maximus:  that is the man
who will be Emperor."
187,MAXIMUS,187,"May I be permitted to go, Highness?"
188,LUCILLA,188,"There was a time when you didn't
call me ""Highness."""
189,MAXIMUS,189,"And there was a time when you were
just a little girl drowning in the
sea.  All that was a different life."
190,LUCILLA,190,"Very different... I wonder if it was
better?"
191,MAXIMUS,191,It was more honest.
192,MAXIMUS,192,I thank you for your prayers.
193,MAXIMUS,193,"Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you
for your guidance.  Bring me your
solace and your wisdom.  Blessed
Mother, come to me in my dreams with
the Gods' desire for my future.
Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and my son with a ready sword.  Keep
them safe until my return.  Whisper
to them in their sleep that I live
only to hold them again and all else
is dust and air.  Ancestors, true
bloodline, I honor you and will try
to live with the dignity you have
taught me."
194,COMMODUS,194,"I search the faces of the Gods for
ways to please you... to make you
proud... and I can never do it.  One
kind word -- one full hug where you
pressed me to your chest and held me
tight -- would have been like the
sun on my heart for a thousand
years... What is it in me you hate
so much?  My eyes are your eyes.  My
hands are your hands.  All I have
ever wanted was to live up to you.
Caesar.  Father."
195,COMMODUS,195,"Why does Maximus deserve what I
could never have? -- Why do you love
his eyes over mine? -- I would
butcher the whole world -- if you
would only love me..."
196,QUINTUS,196,General -- Maximus --
197,MAXIMUS,197,Quintus -- ?
198,QUINTUS,198,The Emperor needs you.  It's urgent.
199,MAXIMUS,199,What is it?  Is he ill?
200,QUINTUS,200,I don't know...
201,COMMODUS,201,"Lament with me, brother, our great
father is dead.  I want --"
202,COMMODUS,202,"General, the Gods' have taken the
great man and left me alone.  My
first desire as Emperor is that you
take my hand in friendship.  I need
you at my side, Maximus, at this
moment above all others.  Stand with
me."
203,MAXIMUS,203,How did he die?
204,MAXIMUS,204,How did he die?
205,COMMODUS,205,"The surgeons say it was his breath
that gave out."
206,COMMODUS,206,"Take my hand, Maximus.  I only offer
it once."
207,MAXIMUS,207,"How will the world speak your name
now, old man?"
208,LUCILLA,208,"Hail, Caesar."
209,MAXIMUS,209,What -- ?!
210,QUINTUS,210,"Please don't fight, Maximus --"
211,MAXIMUS,211,Quintus --
212,QUINTUS,212,"I'm sorry, General, Caesar has
spoken."
213,MAXIMUS,213,"Quintus, what -- ?"
214,QUINTUS,214,I have no choice --
215,MAXIMUS,215,My family?!
216,MAXIMUS,216,"What about my family, Quintus?"
217,QUINTUS,217,"They will greet you in the
afterlife."
218,QUINTUS,218,"Take him as far as the sunrise and
then kill him."
219,ASSASSIN #1,219,"All right, this is far enough."
220,ASSASSIN #1,220,"You two take him down there where no
one will find him."
221,ASSASSIN #3,221,"Come on, General..."
222,MAXIMUS,222,Have you ever done this before?
223,ASSASSIN #3,223,What?
224,MAXIMUS,224,Killed a man with a sword?
225,ASSASSIN #3,225,"Not like this, exactly... this is
good, you can stop."
226,MAXIMUS,226,"It can be very messy -- you could
get blood all over your armor.  You
don't want to hack me up now.  You
want one clean stroke."
227,ASSASSIN #3,227,"Would you kneel, General?"
228,MAXIMUS,228,"One good stroke -- you do know
where, don't you?"
229,ASSASSIN #4,229,Be quiet.
230,MAXIMUS,230,"If you miss the spot there'll be
blood everywhere.  Quite a spray."
231,ASSASSINS #3,231,"All right, where?"
232,MAXIMUS,232,"Here -- you don't want to hit the
vein on the neck --"
233,MAXIMUS,233,"Put the point of your sword here...
you want one, good blow right at
this spot --"
234,COMMODUS,234,"Even as the Gods curse this dark day
with clouds, so too does the sun
begin to shine forth on a promised
tomorrow.  Even as we mourn the
passing of our father, so too do we
celebrate the coming of a bright,
new age for Rome.  At my side,
brothers, you shall pull fresh
glories from the heavens.  At my
side, brothers, you shall know the
adoration of the Gods.  Doubly-dark
is this day because my friend, your
noble commander Maximus Meridas, has
been called to Rome to deal with
urgent matters of state..."
235,COMMODUS,235,"Until his promised return I
appointed Quintus Domitian to serve
in his stead.  I salute you,
Legionnaires!"
236,QUINTUS,236,"Hail, Caesar!"
237,FELIX REGIMENT,237,"Hail, Caesar!"
238,TITUS,238,"Quintus, what is -- ?"
239,QUINTUS,239,"Don't speak of it.  Never speak of
it."
240,MAXIMUS' SON,240,MOTHER!  MOTHER!  FATHER'S HOME!
241,MAXIMUS,241,Am I in Hades?
242,JUBA,242,Yes.
243,JUBA,243,For your wound...
244,JUBA,244,For your wound.
245,JUBA,245,"If you die in the wagons they feed
you to the lions... The lions are
worth more than we are.  I think we
are worth more than the zebras
though.  So they don't feed us to
them."
246,JUBA,246,I'm not sure about the giraffe.
247,SLAVE TRADER,247,"Proximo, my old friend, see what I
have for you today -- !"
248,PROXIMO,248,"Those giraffes you sold me won't
mate!  All they do is run around not
mating!  YOU SOLD ME EUNUCH
GIRAFFES!!"
249,SLAVE TRADER,249,"I will make it up to you, Master.
It's bargain day for you!  Look,
look, look -- I have two lions and a
panther -- hear how they roar for
you!  ""Bring me home, Proximo!"""
250,PROXIMO,250,How much for the lot?
251,SLAVE TRADER,251,"For you -- 8,000 sesterces."
252,PROXIMO,252,"For me -- 6,000 sesterces and I want
to see their balls first.  And you
throw in those two slaves."
253,SLAVE TRADER,253,"What about this one?  Look at the
arms!"
254,PROXIMO,254,Good teeth --
255,PROXIMO,255,Where did you get those scars?
256,PROXIMO,256,Are you a soldier?
257,PROXIMO,257,Do you speak? --
258,PROXIMO,258,KEEP THOSE DAMN FLIES OFF ME!
259,PROXIMO,259,He's dying.
260,SLAVE TRADER,260,"1,000 sesterces."
261,PROXIMO,261,My ass...
262,PROXIMO,262,"You throw in this one and we'll make
it 7,000 sesterces for the whole
lot."
263,SLAVE TRADER,263,"I have to eat, Master!  He's my
finest, I couldn't let him go as
part of the lot for less than 9,000
total..."
264,SLAVE TRADER,264,"I tell you this one is prime.  He's
a Spaniard and killed fourteen of my
men before he could be subdued!"
265,PROXIMO,265,"All right, let's see."
266,PROXIMO,266,That's enough.
267,SLAVE TRADER,267,STOP!  STOP!
268,PROXIMO,268,I'll give you 500 sesterces.
269,SLAVE TRADER,269,"No -- no -- 1,000!"
270,PROXIMO,270,"Come, don't quibble with your old
friend.  I'll take the lions, the
panther, the Numidian and this one
for 7,000.  And I'll buy you the
best whore in the town for two
nights.  She's an enormous mountain
of flesh who craves a stern hand."
271,SLAVE TRADER,271,"How could I say no to my old friend
Proximo?"
272,PROXIMO,272,"COME ON, YOU FILTHY BEAST!"
273,PROXIMO,273,"Slaves.  I am Proximo, trainer of
gladiators.  You live and die at my
pleasure.  Fight well and you will
live.  Fight poorly and you will
die.  It is better to live."
274,PROXIMO,274,"Here you will be trained in the art
of combat.  Here you will be given
the tools to survive.  Please my
patrons in the arena and all the
gifts of the world will be showered
upon you.  Imagine riches beyond
your paltry dreams of riches!
Imagine fame beyond your rude
understanding of the word!  All this
can belong to the select few who
prove their worth in the arena."
275,PROXIMO,275,"If... on the other hand... you
disappoint me... you will be
dismembered and fed to my jackals
limb by limb."
276,PROXIMO,276,And my jackals are always hungry.
277,JUBA,277,Have you killed a man before?
278,JUBA,278,"You should eat.  You'll need your
strength tomorrow."
279,JUBA,279,"I've never killed a man.  But I
think you have."
280,JUBA,280,"I almost killed once.  The Romans
destroyed my village.  I was with a
hunting party and when we
returned... I would have killed
every Roman in the world."
281,JUBA,281,If you don't eat you will die.
282,JUBA,282,"In the village I come from there was
a man once.  He went fishing one day
and his boat was attacked by
crocodiles.  One of them ate his
leg.  He pulled himself to the shore
and a lion attacked him.  It ate one
of his arms.  He dragged himself
through the desert on the way home
and a scorpion stung his eye.  So he
only had one eye.  When he reached
the village I sat with him.  I said,
""You have lost a leg, an arm and one
eye.  You must have a mighty will to
live.""  He said, ""No, Lord, it's
just better than the alternative."""
283,JUBA,283,"Life is a gift from our fathers to
us.  Who are you to give it up for
lack of lifting a spoon?"
284,SCRIBE,284,"I know nothing of armaments and
warfare!  I'm a scribe -- I write
down words!  I can write down seven
languages --"
285,VIBIUS,285,Be still.
286,SCRIBE,286,"I don't -- how do you hold the
sword?!  I've never held a sword!"
287,VIBIUS,287,"You point the sharp end at your
opponent and you shove it in his
guts."
288,SCRIBE,288,I can't -- I --
289,VIBIUS,289,"Proximo!  You insult me with this
carrion!  Chain him to someone else!"
290,PROXIMO,290,"Don't worry, noble Vibius, he won't
be bothering you for long."
291,CHILDREN,291,Dead guts!  Dead guts!  Dead guts!
292,PROXIMO,292,"Some of you say you can't fight, you
won't fight... They all say that...
But one day you will pick up a sword
and thrust it into another man.  And
the crowd will cheer you and love
you.  And you will love them for it.
On that day... you will be a
gladiator."
293,PROXIMO,293,"In this life, we all die.  All we
can choose is how we die.  And how
we are remembered.  Be remembered
proudly."
294,PROXIMO,294,No...
295,PROXIMO,295,"... give the Spaniard to him.  Give
the Scribe to Vibius."
296,JUBA,296,Are we going to fight each other?
297,PROXIMO,297,"Make it 600 sesterces for each
decapitation."
298,TRAINER #1,298,How many strokes?
299,PROXIMO,299,Two.
300,TRAINER #1,300,"For the great Vibius, one stroke."
301,PROXIMO,301,"Done.  400 sesterces for two
strokes."
302,TRAINER #1,302,Who's he with?
303,PROXIMO,303,A Greek Scribe.
304,TRAINER #1,304,I'll raise the wager.
305,PROXIMO,305,"Give me odds, friend."
306,GRACCHUS,306,"We have plague in the Hebrew Quarter
and it is spreading... we have
looting at the granaries... we have
so much filth in the Tiber that the
water is undrinkable... we have
Praetorian Guard units that are
demanding protection payments from
the merchants at the exchange --"
307,MARCELLUS,307,"My City Guard units have tried to
curtail these excesses but no
constabulary can police the entire
city.  And the Praetorians outnumber
us two to one."
308,GRACCHUS,308,"Rome dies as the Emperor plays at
beneficence.  At least Nero gave us
music!"
309,GAIUS,309,Do you think he'll listen to us?
310,GRACCHUS,310,"It is his duty to hear the will of
the Senate."
311,GRACCHUS,311,Not to mention the damn traffic!
312,CHILD,312,"We honor Caesar with the laurel to
show our love and appreciation for
his benevolence."
313,COMMODUS,313,"Caesar is honored to accept your
tribute, Citizen Scholar."
314,COMMODUS,314,"It is the most sacred duty of the
Emperor to oversee the education of
the young.  If I could leave no
other legacy than the scholarship of
all children my life would be
blessed.  Tutors, you hold the
future of Rome in your hands.  Teach
them well so that they will bring
honor to the Empire.  I salute you."
315,COMMODUS,315,"Look at them, Senators... my truest
gift to Rome."
316,GRACCHUS,316,"Darling children, to be sure, now if
I may proceed?"
317,COMMODUS,317,Very well...
318,GRACCHUS,318,"Caesar, your presence in Rome is an
invaluable opportunity to begin
correcting some of the ills that
have beset the city since your
father went to the wars.  We would
like to --"
319,COMMODUS,319,"Peace, good Gracchus, peace..."
320,COMMODUS,320,"My beloved father was a careless
shepherd to his flock.  I shall be a
good father to my children.  I shall
remain in Rome and show them how
they are loved."
321,GRACCHUS,321,"With respect, sire, the people don't
need love -- they need law.  The
Senate has prepared a series of
protocols to begin addressing the
corruption in the city --"
322,GRACCHUS,322,"-- starting with basic sanitation in
the Hebrew Quarter.  If Caesar could
study this and --"
323,COMMODUS,323,"You see that's the very problem,
isn't it, my old, old friend?  My
father spent all his time at study.
At books and learning and
philosophy..."
324,COMMODUS,324,"He spent his twilight hours reading
scrolls from the Senate.  All the
while, the people were forgotten."
325,GRACCHUS,325,The Senate is the people.
326,COMMODUS,326,"I doubt many of the people eat so
well as you do, Senator Gracchus..."
327,COMMODUS,327,"I doubt many of the people have such
splendid armor, Captain Marcellus.
Or such fine mistresses, Senator
Gaius.  No... only their true father
knows what the people need.  I shall
show them they are loved.  I shall
hold them to my bosom and embrace
them tightly --"
328,GRACCHUS,328,"Have you ever embraced someone dying
of plague, sire?"
329,COMMODUS,329,"No.  But if you interrupt me one
more time I assure you that you
shall.  I will emulate the immortal
Caesars of the past.  I will give
the people what they truly want.
Starting this day I will draw all of
Rome to the Colosseum.  I will give
them bread.  And they will want
nothing more."
330,GRACCHUS,330,You want to hold games?
331,COMMODUS,331,"Not just any games, Senator!  A
series of games that will make the
Gods envious and leave my children
happy!  I will subsidize the arena
from this day forth -- and I will
culminate this celebration in a
great spectacle the likes of which
the world has never seen!  A great
spectacle to honor my father!
Magnificent, unending weeks of
festivity all in the name of Marcus
Aurelius!"
332,GRACCHUS,332,"If I may, Caesar... how are you
going to pay for this?"
333,COMMODUS,333,That is not your concern.
334,GRACCHUS,334,"Respectfully, sire, taxation and
import duties are the exclusive
province of the Senate --"
335,COMMODUS,335,"MY FATHER DESERVES TO BE HONORED AND
I WILL HONOR HIM! -- AND THE PEOPLE
WILL LOVE ME! -- AND THE SENATE WILL
OBEY ME OR EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL
BURN!  BURN!  BURN! -- I WILL HAVE
ORDER!"
336,LUCILLA,336,"Gentlemen, in the future do not
concern my brother with these
matters.  Come to me."
337,MARCELLUS,337,Games?  He wants to hold games?
338,GAIUS,338,It's madness.
339,GRACCHUS,339,No... it's not...
340,GRACCHUS,340,"He knows who Rome is.  Rome is the
mob.  He will conjure magic for them
and they will be distracted.  And he
will takes their lives.  And he will
take their freedom.  And still they
will roar.  The beating heart of
Rome isn't the marble of the Senate.
It's the sand of the Colosseum.  He
will give them death.  And they will
love him for it."
341,PROXIMO,341,"I've wagered on you against the
Celts -- ignore the others and go
for them -- there are two axe-and-
net and two long spear.  Now the
Celts aren't used to the sun so you
have the advantage there..."
342,PROXIMO,342,"And keep them moving, their lungs
aren't strong, ground the spears as
soon as you can and then go for the
ax-men.  If you get all four there's
an extra bonus so don't be
distracted by the Spartans..."
343,VIBIUS,343,"MOVE ASIDE!  THIS IS A TABLE FOR
MEN!"
344,PROXIMO,344,Butterfly?
345,PROXIMO,345,Perhaps you'd like a woman?
346,PROXIMO,346,Boy?
347,PROXIMO,347,Gold?
348,PROXIMO,348,"Well, I have nothing left to offer
you!  A man who turns down a
butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold
confuses me.  Personally, I'd grab
them all and then grab some more
because the Gods are fanciful and
take us at their whim.  Does the
Spaniard have any needs?"
349,PROXIMO,349,"You fight like a soldier.  You have
wounds like a soldier who has been
on long campaigns.  You eye the
world around you like an enemy.
What is your name, Roman soldier?"
350,MAXIMUS,350,Gladiator.
351,PROXIMO,351,And nothing more?
352,MAXIMUS,352,Nothing more.
353,PROXIMO,353,In two days we leave for Rome.
354,PROXIMO,354,"Ah... so it's Rome you want.  Well
you shall have her, Gladiator.  The
new Emperor has ordered a series of
matches to culminate in a grand
spectacle.  If you do well I shall
become very, very rich.  If you do
well enough I shall set you free.
Is it freedom you want?"
355,PROXIMO,355,Not even that.
356,MAXIMUS,356,The Emperor -- will he be there?
357,PROXIMO,357,"Oh yes.  He's apparently quite mad
about the games.  Spending a
fortune, which is, needless to say,
good for me again.  But what is good
for you, Gladiator?"
358,MAXIMUS,358,"Have you -- how does one meet the
Emperor?"
359,PROXIMO,359,As a gladiator?
360,MAXIMUS,360,Yes.
361,PROXIMO,361,One doesn't.
362,PROXIMO,362,"Except... If one has proven oneself
in battle.  If at the end of the
games you are the final man standing
-- the Emperor will present you with
a small wooden sword.  The sword is
your freedom."
363,MAXIMUS,363,He give it personally?
364,PROXIMO,364,He did to me...
365,PROXIMO,365,"Our great father Marcus Aurelius
looked into my eyes and touched me
on the shoulder."
366,MAXIMUS,366,You knew Marcus?
367,PROXIMO,367,"I didn't know him.  He touched me on
the shoulder.  Just once.  But that
was enough."
368,PROXIMO,368,"All right, Gladiator.  We shall go
to Rome together and have bloody
adventures.  The Great Whore will
suckle us until we are fat and happy
and can't suck another drop.  That
is Rome."
369,COMMODUS,369,"All my desires are splitting my head
to pieces -- there's so much I want
to do -- but all my efforts to show
my children they are loved go
unappreciated by those dragons in
the Senate --"
370,LUCILLA,370,"Quiet, brother..."
371,LUCILLA,371,"Leave the Senate to me.  Don't
trouble yourself."
372,COMMODUS,372,"All I want is to be a good father to
my people.  Why don't they
understand that?"
373,LUCILLA,373,Shhh.  The tonic will help...
374,LUCILLA,374,"Yes, just drink this down."
375,COMMODUS,375,"I must take a firmer hand with them.
They must know their father can be
firm.  As our father was firm with
us."
376,LUCILLA,376,"Our father lost his way.  His
mistake was believing the old songs
of the ""Republic.""  We know better.
So let the Senate talk.  They have
no real power."
377,COMMODUS,377,"Yes... yes... you always know the
way.  You were always so wise in
these matters..."
378,COMMODUS,378,"You know if I didn't have my duty to
Rome I think I should be an artist.
I should go away and paint pictures
of the sea and leave all the
politics to you..."
379,COMMODUS,379,Will you stay with me?
380,LUCILLA,380,"Still afraid of the dark, brother?"
381,COMMODUS,381,Still.  Always.
382,COMMODUS,382,My dreams would terrify the world.
383,LUCILLA,383,"I'll stay with you until you are
asleep."
384,COMMODUS,384,"And after... just sit with me.  Keep
me safe..."
385,LUCILLA,385,He's asleep.  Be quick.
386,GRACCHUS,386,"We've taking a sounding, the Senate
is with us."
387,LUCILLA,387,Good.
388,GRACCHUS,388,"But we are only words.  We are air.
We need steel."
389,MARCELLUS,389,"The City Guard is faithful to the
Republic.  But we don't stand a
chance against the Praetorians."
390,LUCILLA,390,Can they be bought?
391,MARCELLUS,391,"They are zealots -- totally
committed to your brother."
392,GRACCHUS,392,"Well, can they at least be rented
for a day?"
393,MARCELLUS,393,"I doubt it.  He pays them exorbitant
salaries and lets them loot and
extort as they see fit.  The city
belongs to them."
394,LUCILLA,394,"And they've started arresting
scholars now.  Anyone who dares
speak out -- even satirists and
chroniclers."
395,MARCELLUS,395,"And mathematicians and Christians.
All to fill the arena."
396,GAIUS,396,"And what pays for it?  These games
are costing a fortune and yet we
have no new taxes."
397,LUCILLA,397,"The future.  The future pays for
it..."
398,LUCILLA,398,"He's started selling the grain
reserves."
399,GAIUS,399,No.
400,MARCELLUS,400,That can't be true...
401,LUCILLA,401,"He's selling Rome's reserves of
grain.  The people will be starving
in two years.  I hope they are
enjoying the spectacles because soon
enough they will be dead because of
them."
402,MARCELLUS,402,Rome must know this.
403,LUCILLA,403,"And who will tell them?!  You,
Marcellus?  You, Senator Gaius?
Will you make a speech on the Senate
floor denouncing my brother?  And
then see your family in the
Colosseum?  What town-crier would
dare?"
404,LUCILLA,404,He must die.
405,GAIUS,405,"The Praetorians would only seize
control themselves."
406,LUCILLA,406,"No -- cut off the head and the snake
cannot strike."
407,GRACCHUS,407,"Lucilla, Gaius is right.  Until the
City Guard can neutralize the
Praetorians we can accomplish
nothing."
408,MARCELLUS,408,And I haven't enough men.
409,LUCILLA,409,What about the army?
410,GAIUS,410,"No Roman army has entered the
capital in a hundred years."
411,LUCILLA,411,So we do nothing?!
412,LUCIUS' VOICE,412,Mother...
413,LUCIUS,413,I heard voices...
414,LUCILLA,414,"It's all right, darling, you --"
415,LUCIUS,415,Senator!  What did you bring me?!
416,GRACCHUS,416,"For you prince Lucius... a sea
monster!"
417,GRACCHUS,417,"Off the coast of Achaea they grow
twenty times this size, with
snapping teeth to devour any nasty
Praetorians they come across... now,
where is Achaea?"
418,LUCIUS,418,Below Macedonia!
419,GRACCHUS,419,Show me on the map.
420,LUCILLA,420,"Lucius, you go in now, I'll be in
shortly."
421,LUCIUS,421,"Thank you, Senator Mountain!"
422,GRACCHUS,422,"You're welcome, Prince Anthill!"
423,LUCILLA,423,What are you going to do?
424,GRACCHUS,424,"Peace child... One dark night the
Gods will light our path.  They will
give us the voice we need.  Have
faith in that.  Have faith."
425,VIBIUS,425,Not what you expected?
426,MAXIMUS,426,No.
427,VIBIUS,427,"Rome is nothing but a slaughter
house.  And we are the meat."
428,VIBIUS,428,Tradition.  He watches over us.
429,VIBIUS,429,"Oh go on, it won't kill you."
430,PROXIMO,430,"Stop that!  You'll get some
monstrous disease and then you'll be
worth nothing to me!"
431,JUBA,431,"Do you think it will be much
different?  Here in Rome?"
432,MAXIMUS,432,Bigger arena.  Same killing.
433,JUBA,433,Are you scared for tomorrow?
434,MAXIMUS,434,No.
435,JUBA,435,Me too.
436,JUBA,436,"I never though it would be so easy
to kill."
437,JUBA,437,So you're finally home.
438,MAXIMUS,438,This isn't my home.
439,JUBA,439,For all Romans... this is home.
440,JUBA,440,"Among my people we honor the soil of
our home.  Our ancestors are in that
soil.  All their dreams live there.
I will never see my home again.  The
soil is dead and no one honors them,
so the dreams die."
441,MAXIMUS,441,Perhaps one day you'll return.
442,JUBA,442,"How can I go back?  I am not what I
was.  When a man kills for no
reason, he has lost himself."
443,CASSIUS,443,"... and the Emperor will have no
more animal battles today --"
444,TRAINER #1,444,"You promised me a bear match,
Cassius!"
445,TRAINER #2,445,"I have ten damned gorillas!  You
said gorillas yesterday!"
446,CASSIUS,446,"Talk to the man in the imperial box.
Who has the next slot...?"
447,CASSIUS,447,"-- Lentulus, Gideon, Trebonius and
Proximo --"
448,CASSIUS,448,"-- Nice to have you back, you
piratical bastard -- now listen, the
Emperor wants the Carthage
spectacle."
449,PROXIMO,449,"No -- have pity, Cassius -- !"
450,TRAINER #3,450,My men are too good for -- !
451,CASSIUS,451,"You give us the Carthage match or
lose your spot on the rotation --
but don't worry -- gold is flowing
from the Emperor's fingers."
452,TRAINER #3,452,It'll cost you --
453,PROXIMO,453,"I won't do it for less than 100,000
sesterces -- !"
454,TRAINER #4,454,"120,000!  All I have is my best
Thracians!"
455,CASSIUS,455,"And I want to see this famous
Spaniard of yours -- his reputation
soars from the provinces.  The
people are eager for him --"
456,PROXIMO,456,"I won't throw my Spaniard into a
spectacle!  Damn you and damn the
rotation!"
457,CASSIUS,457,"You will and the price will be
90,000 sesterces each --"
458,CASSIUS,458,"-- which you all know is exorbitant
-- AND IF YOU EXTORTING BLOOD-WHORES
TRY TO PAWN OFF LESSER FIGHTERS ON
ME I WILL SEE YOU DEAD IN THE ARENA
TOMORROW!"
459,TRAINER #4,459,My Thracians are worth -- !
460,CASSIUS,460,"Give me your best, brothers.  They
die before Caesar."
461,PROXIMO,461,"I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will
kill at least one of your Thracians."
462,TRAINER #4,462,"30,000?!  On a Spaniard?!  That
provincial sun has curdled your
brain!"
463,PROXIMO,463,"Then make the wager, you smug
bastard!"
464,PROXIMO,464,"All right -- there are three other
teams, four men each --"
465,PROXIMO,465,You know what a Thracian looks like?
466,MAXIMUS,466,"Yes, but --"
467,PROXIMO,467,"Ignore the others -- go for the
Thracians.  The sun is to the east
-- over the gate -- keep your back
to the gate and you won't have the
sun."
468,MAXIMUS,468,What -- ?
469,PROXIMO,469,Hurry -- !
470,PROXIMO,470,"Die well and we'll sing songs about
you for a generation."
471,CASSIUS,471,"This day we reach back to hallowed
antiquity to bring you... THE FALL
OF MIGHTY CARTHAGE...!"
472,CASSIUS,472,"... On the barren armies of the
barbarian Hannibal!  Ferocious
mercenaries and warriors of all
brute nations bent on merciless
conquest!  Your Emperor is pleased
to give you... THE BARBARIAN HORDE!"
473,CASSIUS,473,"But on that illustrious day the Gods
sent against them Rome's greatest
warriors...!  The very life-image of
nobility and glorious valor... who
would on this day, and on these same
arid Numidian deserts, decide THE
FATE OF THE EMPIRE... Your Emperor
is pleased to give you... THE
LEGIONNAIRES OF SCIPIO AFRICANUS!!"
474,COMMODUS,474,Slave!  Who are you?
475,COMMODUS,475,SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU?
476,COMMODUS,476,SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU?!
477,MAXIMUS,477,"I AM MAXIMUS MERIDAS, GENERAL OF THE
FELIX REGIMENT OF THE ROMAN ARMY AND
SERVANT TO THE EMPEROR MARCUS
AURELIUS!"
478,MAXIMUS,478,"I AM FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND
HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE AND
LANDLORD TO A MURDERED WORLD -- AND
I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE!"
479,COMMODUS,479,Why is he still alive?
480,LUCILLA,480,I don't know.
481,COMMODUS,481,"He shouldn't be alive.  That vexes
me.  I am terribly vexed..."
482,COMMODUS,482,"There, that's better.  Do you like
the platform here?"
483,LUCILLA,483,Mmm.
484,COMMODUS,484,"I do too.  Simple, elegant..."
485,COMMODUS,485,"Father would have wanted something
more ornate but he's dead now."
486,COMMODUS,486,"Maximus Meridas haunts me.  I see
Father turning away from me and
gazing at him.  How many times did I
suffer that indignity, I wonder?"
487,LUCILLA,487,What are you going to do?
488,COMMODUS,488,I'm going to kill him.
489,LUCILLA,489,Good.
490,COMMODUS,490,"Oh, you're too clever, Sister.
Don't tell me part of you won't weep
for him."
491,LUCILLA,491,"When he defies my brother the
Emperor, he defies me.  But you
shouldn't send assassins."
492,COMMODUS,492,No?
493,LUCILLA,493,"The people embraced him today.  They
will be expecting his next match..."
494,LUCILLA,494,"... let him die in the arena like
the slave he is.  Let the people see
what comes of defying Caesar."
495,COMMODUS,495,"He wounded you deeply, didn't he?
Long ago."
496,COMMODUS,496,"Nonetheless, your political acumen
is, as always, unerring."
497,JUBA,497,I will fight with you.
498,MAXIMUS,498,This isn't your battle.
499,JUBA,499,"Better to die for a friend than to
die for gold."
500,PROXIMO,500,"Enjoy yourself, Madame..."
501,PROXIMO,501,"General, perform well and there will
be riches for you."
502,LUCILLA,502,"Rich matrons pay well to be
pleasured by the bravest champions."
503,MAXIMUS,503,"I knew your brother would send
assassins.  I didn't think he would
send his best."
504,LUCILLA,504,"Maximus, listen to me --"
505,MAXIMUS,505,"My family were crucified and burnt
while they were still alive."
506,LUCILLA,506,I knew nothing of that.
507,MAXIMUS,507,Don't lie to me.
508,LUCILLA,508,I wept for them.
509,MAXIMUS,509,Don't.
510,LUCILLA,510,"Do you know what it is to be the
daughter of the Emperor?  I learned
on the night my father had my
husband killed.  I loved my husband
very much.  Very... simply.  He was
a man who believed in the Republic.
He was a man who thought Marcus
should be tending to Rome and not
conquering the world.  One night my
father had him strangled for
conspiring with the Senate.  My
father never spoke of it.  I never
spoke of it.  That is what it is to
be the daughter of Rome."
511,LUCILLA,511,"My son will live.  He will survive
this cursed bloodline.  Rome will
die and the jackals will pick her
clean -- but my son will survive.
Empires come and go.  Cities crumble
to dust.  Only family matters."
512,MAXIMUS,512,My son was innocent.
513,LUCILLA,513,So is mine.
514,MAXIMUS,514,I want your brother dead.
515,LUCILLA,515,So do I.
516,LUCILLA,516,"My son will never be safe while he
lives."
517,MAXIMUS,517,How do you plan it?
518,LUCILLA,518,"The Senate is with us, and the City
Guard.  We have growing power in the
streets.  But we need a leader.
Someone the people can --"
519,MAXIMUS,519,So the crown passes to your son.
520,LUCILLA,520,"No.  So that my son will be safe.
So that we may leave this charnel
house forever and never look back.
Look into my eyes, Maximus, and
believe what I say to you..."
521,LUCILLA,521,"By all the Gods, and in the name of
my father who loved you, and in the
name of the husband I loved... I
swear to stand by your side in this
now and always."
522,MAXIMUS,522,What is your son's name?
523,LUCILLA,523,Lucius Verus.  Like his father.
524,MAXIMUS,524,I weep for him.
525,LUCILLA,525,"Commodus plans to kill you in your
next match in the arena.  He's
planning something.  I will pray for
you.  As I have always done."
526,CASSIUS,526,"... in his majestic charity the
Emperor has deigned to this day
favor the people of Rome with an
historical final match.  Returning
to the Colosseum today... after five
years in retirement... Caesar is
pleased to bring you... THE ONLY
UNDEFEATED CHAMPION IN ROMAN
HISTORY..."
527,CASSIUS,527,... THE LEGENDARY... TIGER OF GAUL!!
528,PROXIMO,528,"Gods!  That old Homicide!  The
Emperor must truly hate you."
529,MAXIMUS,529,What can you tell me?
530,PROXIMO,530,He cheats.
531,CASSIUS,531,"And from the rocky promontories and
martial bloodlines of Spain...
representing the training lyceum of
Proximo Antoninus... I give you...
THE WARRIOR MAXIMUS!"
532,MAXIMUS AND TIGER,532,We who are about to die salute you.
533,LUCIUS' VOICE,533,Is it true you're a General...?
534,MAXIMUS,534,I was a General.
535,LUCIUS,535,"I saw you fight.  The Carthage
battle too.  I've never seen so much
courage."
536,MAXIMUS,536,It doesn't take courage to kill.
537,LUCIUS,537,My father was killed.
538,MAXIMUS,538,I'm sorry.
539,LUCIUS,539,"He still comes to me in my dreams.
Do you have a father?"
540,MAXIMUS,540,"I had a father.  He wasn't really my
father but I cared for him very much."
541,LUCIUS,541,"I hope he comes to you in your
dreams.  My father and I ride horses
in mine."
542,LUCILLA,542,"Lucius, run along now.  I need to
talk to the General."
543,MAXIMUS,543,Where is my army?
544,LUCILLA,544,"... Maximus will summon his army
from Ostia and he will strike from
the inside as his army strikes from
the outside.  But he insists that
the Senate be present."
545,GAIUS,545,We've been ordered to attend.
546,LUCILLA,546,How many are with us?
547,GRACCHUS,547,"About half.  But once the tyrant is
dead.  All."
548,GRACCHUS,548,I want to meet him.
549,LUCILLA,549,I'll arrange it.
550,GAIUS,550,And what of the Emperor?
551,LUCILLA,551,"He has withdrawn.  He's not eating.
He doesn't go out.  He won't even
see me... I don't know what tempests
rage within him but..."
552,GRACCHUS,552,"We should fear for the blackest
storm."
553,LUCILLA,553,Yes.
554,GAIUS,554,"One question... who is to be the
actual Regicide?"
555,VIBIUS,555,You didn't kill him.
556,MAXIMUS,556,"I will not kill another warrior.
There is no honor to it."
557,KIDS,557,"Maximus the Merciful!  Maximus the
Merciful!"
558,MAXIMUS,558,"Tell him we will enter Rome on the
first day of Commodus' festival."
559,LUCILLA,559,And they will march on Rome for you?
560,MAXIMUS,560,"Yes.  But this letter must go to the
lieutenant named Titus, no one else."
561,LUCILLA,561,"Captain Marcellus will take it.  And
his City Guard will by with you when
you get to Rome.  Is that enough to
face the Praetorian Guard?"
562,MAXIMUS,562,"The Felix Regiment will never be
defeated."
563,GRACCHUS,563,"I only have one question for you,
General... Why?"
564,GRACCHUS,564,"You will lead an army of your
brothers on Rome.  Many will die.
Why?"
565,MAXIMUS,565,I want Commodus dead.
566,GRACCHUS,566,"That's not the reason.  Tell me the
truth."
567,MAXIMUS,567,"Because one night an old man
whispered to me about a dream.  I
will die for that dream."
568,GRACCHUS,568,"I knew the old man well.  And I
loved him very much.  In our youth
we would spend hours building that
dream together.  After he went to
the wars and lost his way... I was
very cruel.  I tormented him to
remember that dream we spoke of."
569,MAXIMUS,569,He did.
570,GRACCHUS,570,"You can have no idea how much that
means to me."
571,GRACCHUS,571,"Any man who will die for a whispered
dream deserves my respect.  I honor
you, General."
572,CENTURION,572,"Madame, the Emperor would like to
see you."
573,LUCILLA,573,Caesar...
574,COMMODUS,574,"I am sorry to have kept you away...
I needed this time to think..."
575,LUCILLA,575,Of course...
576,COMMODUS,576,"I limited my world to these four
walls so as to let my mind free...
again and again my mind settles on
but one question... What kind of
world are we making when the people
of Rome prefer a slave in the arena
to their father?"
577,COMMODUS,577,"It is my responsibility to make the
world as it should be.  How is it I
have made this world?"
578,LUCILLA,578,"Brother, do not be influenced by the
mob.  They are a great, faceless
beast --"
579,COMMODUS,579,"They are not ""the mob,"" Lucilla,
they are the people.  They are my
children and all I want to do is
love them."
580,COMMODUS,580,"Our father loved Maximus... and I
love him still... yet he defies me,
he tasks me in front of my children.
And they love him for it.  Just as
Marcus loved him for it.  Tell me
why, Lucilla."
581,LUCILLA,581,"They see themselves in him.  They
throw in their own sad dreams
alongside his.  They think he fights
for them."
582,COMMODUS,582,"And what do I do but fight for
them?!  I give them games to please
them.  I strangle dissent to give
them peace.  I empower the
Praetorians to give them order.
What more can I do?!"
583,COMMODUS,583,"Say I should fight him, in the
arena.  Let my children see who the
Gods truly favor."
584,LUCILLA,584,And what if he should win?
585,COMMODUS,585,A God is more powerful than a man...
586,LUCILLA,586,"Caesar, you let this unduly worry
you.  At best he is a passing fancy
-- he is a name, an image on a
banner, ephemeral -- he will be
forgotten as the next fancy
appears --"
587,COMMODUS,587,"But I need to know -- why do they
love him?"
588,LUCILLA,588,Mercy.
589,LUCILLA,589,"He will not kill in the arena.  He
is merciful.  As they all wish they
were in their own hearts."
590,COMMODUS,590,"And for that moment in the arena
they are merciful too.  For a
moment... they are Gods.  Offering
life."
591,COMMODUS,591,"But who can be more merciful than
the Emperor of Rome?"
592,COMMODUS,592,"Brother... we've taken a sad path
since we were children at Capri,
have we not?"
593,COMMODUS,593,"For my own part... I am sorry it
came to this.  And to you alone of
all men, I acknowledge my errors.
And my regret.  I shall live with my
sin for all my days."
594,MAXIMUS,594,"As will I, Commodus.  As will I."
595,COMMODUS,595,"As the first act of my contrition I
offer you the wooden sword of
freedom."
596,COMMODUS,596,"Take it, brother.  Stand at my side
as a free man worthy of your
ancestors."
597,MAXIMUS,597,"I only have ancestors because of
you, brother.  You killed everything
that ever lived alongside me."
598,COMMODUS,598,"Take it, Maximus.  Let us heal that
fatal wound together."
599,MAXIMUS,599,"This is the new home you cursed me
to.  And I am safer here from your
treachery than I could ever be
outside."
600,COMMODUS,600,Will you always mistrust me?
601,MAXIMUS,601,Why don't you ask your father that?
602,MAXIMUS,602,"I have more power as a slave in the
arena than I could ever have as a
free man.  As the Colosseum goes,
the people go.  As the people go,
the Empire goes."
603,COMMODUS,603,"You think this is power?  I could
show you power, slave --"
604,MAXIMUS,604,"No, Caesar... I will show you."
605,MAXIMUS,605,"The Felix Regiment will come from
here.  We'll face the body of the
Praetorians outside -- here.  Once
inside, my archers will take up
position to counter opposition
inside the Colosseum.  I'll enter
and join you -- we'll attack here --"
606,MAXIMUS,606,-- a covert assault from within.
607,VIBIUS,607,We'll be killed.
608,MAXIMUS,608,Probably.
609,MAXIMUS,609,"But if we aren't... think of the
glory.  Do you remember glory,
Gladiator?"
610,JUBA,610,"And if we die that day -- we die
free men worthy of our ancestors."
611,VIBIUS,611,"You didn't know my ancestors.  A
rotten bunch."
612,MAXIMUS,612,"Then be worthy of him.  The old
Titan who would rather die bravely
in a just battle than slink off to
grow old and fat."
613,JUBA,613,And impotent.
614,VIBIUS,614,"If I die, I want a hundred whores at
my funeral."
615,COMMODUS,615,Where is my sister?
616,HANDMAIDEN,616,"She's out, sir..."
617,COMMODUS,617,Where?
618,HANDMAIDEN,618,"I... don't know, Caesar."
619,COMMODUS,619,Where is my sister?
620,MAXIMUS,620,Was it Centurion...?  General...?
621,PROXIMO,621,Captain.
622,PROXIMO,622,How did you know?
623,MAXIMUS,623,A soldier knows a soldier.
624,PROXIMO,624,"All that was a long time ago.  Too
much wine and too many women.  And
too much money."
625,MAXIMUS,625,No --
626,PROXIMO,626,This is who I am...
627,PROXIMO,627,"You see?  There was a time I would
stand against ten men and never give
an inch, spitting into the jaws of
Hades all the while.  There was a
time my heart swelled to strap on
the armor of Rome.  But now..."
628,PROXIMO,628,Now I am just an entertainer.
629,MAXIMUS,629,"You said something to me once.  You
said in this life, we all die.  All
we can choose is how we die.  And
how we are remembered.  Do you
recall those words?"
630,PROXIMO,630,Yes.
631,MAXIMUS,631,"Then be remembered proudly.  This is
your time, Proximo.  Stand at my
side and be what you were.  What you
truly are.  One last time."
632,PROXIMO,632,"You might have spared yourself the
speech, General.  The lady Lucilla
bought all my gladiators two hours
ago!"
633,MAXIMUS,633,You pox-ridden bastard -- !
634,PROXIMO,634,"I am the richest trainer in the
Empire!  And I will let my
gladiators do anything you like!
Conspire away, General!"
635,PROXIMO,635,"But I tell you -- if you survive
this madness I want you to go into
business with me.  I'll give you a
quarter of my holdings."
636,MAXIMUS,636,A quarter?!
637,PROXIMO,637,"A third.  And not a hair more.  And
you'll have to start in the
provinces!  Cleaning up the lion
shit!"
638,MAXIMUS,638,"You know, if you were half so awful
as you pretend, you'd be a
terrifying man."
639,MAXIMUS,639,Lucilla --
640,LUCILLA,640,"Don't even say it.  I know it's
dangerous -- but I had to see you.
Captain Marcellus has gone to the
army with your message as you
instructed."
641,MAXIMUS,641,Good.
642,LUCILLA,642,"He says the City Guard will be ready
at the south road at noon.  They can
only wait for an hour so --"
643,MAXIMUS,643,You've told me this already.
644,LUCILLA,644,"Did I?  All right then.  So
everything is prepared.  The Senate
will be in attendance and you have
your gladiators -- the usual cohort
of Praetorians will be inside the
arena --"
645,MAXIMUS,645,Lucilla... why are you here?
646,LUCILLA,646,"Tell me honestly... please... do you
think it will work?"
647,MAXIMUS,647,No.
648,LUCILLA,648,Do you think we'll all die?
649,MAXIMUS,649,Yes.
650,LUCILLA,650,Will you swear something to me?
651,MAXIMUS,651,Yes.
652,LUCILLA,652,"Will you swear it on the memory of
your son?"
653,MAXIMUS,653,Yes.
654,LUCILLA,654,"By all that you have ever loved...
swear that if you survive you will
take my son out of Rome.  Swear that
you will go far away and never
return."
655,MAXIMUS,655,I will.
656,MAXIMUS,656,"And if I should not survive... swear
to me that you will honor my family
in your prayers always."
657,LUCILLA,657,I will.
658,LUCILLA,658,"Had I not been the daughter of
Rome..."
659,MAXIMUS,659,Shhh... my heart breaks enough.
660,COMMODUS,660,"Sister... join us.  I've been
reading to dear Lucius."
661,LUCIUS,661,I've been reading too.
662,COMMODUS,662,"Yes, he's a very smart little boy.
He'll make a grand Emperor one day."
663,COMMODUS,663,"Join us, sister."
664,COMMODUS,664,"We've been reading about the great
Julius and his adventures in Egypt."
665,LUCIUS,665,She killed herself with a snake!
666,COMMODUS,666,"And just wait until you hear what
happened to some of our other
ancestors!  If you're very good,
tomorrow night I'll tell you the
story of Emperor Claudius.  He was
betrayed!  By those closest to
him..."
667,COMMODUS,667,"... by his own blood... they
whispered in dark corners and went
out late at night and conspired and
conspired..."
668,COMMODUS,668,"But the Emperor Claudius knew that
they were up to something dire.  He
knew they were busy little bees.
And one night he sat down with one
of them and he looked at her and he
said:  ""Tell me what you have been
doing, busy little bee, or I shall
strike down those dearest to you.
You shall watch as I bathe in their
blood.""  And the bee knew he spoke
the truth, for the Emperor always
speaks the truth.  And what do you
think happened then, Lucius?"
669,LUCIUS,669,"I don't know, Uncle."
670,COMMODUS,670,The bee told him everything.
671,PROXIMO,671,"Release them!  Release them all!
ARM THEM!"
672,PROXIMO,672,Come --
673,MAXIMUS,673,But --
674,PROXIMO,674,If you want to live -- follow me --
675,VIBIUS,675,"Go, Spaniard!  We'll show these
Roman dogs how gladiators fight!"
676,PROXIMO,676,"All the old gladiator schools have
tunnels to the Colosseum -- most
have long since collapsed --"
677,JUBA,677,How did they know?
678,MAXIMUS,678,We were betrayed.
679,JUBA,679,"I'll stay here.  In case they
follow."
680,JUBA,680,Go!  Bring us the army!
681,PROXIMO,681,Quickly --
682,PROXIMO,682,"Down that corridor is the butchery
-- the blood sloughs lead to the
Tiber.  Gods watch over you."
683,MAXIMUS,683,You're not coming?
684,PROXIMO,684,They are killing my men!
685,PROXIMO,685,Gods... they're killing them all.
686,LUCIUS,686,What is that fire?
687,COMMODUS,687,"Why that's a bonfire, Lucius.  I
arranged it just for you."
688,PRAETORIAN,688,Caesar...
689,COMMODUS,689,Oh... that's for my sister.
690,TITUS,690,By all the Gods...
691,MAXIMUS,691,Old friend...
692,TITUS,692,"You're returned from Hades!  By all
the Gods!"
693,MAXIMUS,693,Where is he?
694,MAXIMUS,694,I forgive you.
695,COMMODUS,695,"Rome... This is the day that was
foretold.  This is the day when your
father takes away all fear..."
696,COMMODUS,696,"With these hands I shall destroy
your enemies so that you may sleep
always and forever in peace.  From
this day forth let it be known that
I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,
have surmounted mortality.  That I,
Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,
assume my destined place... at the
side of the Gods."
697,COMMODUS,697,"And as a righteous God, I shall ever
protect you.  I shall cradle the
world on my benevolent hands and
clasp it to my heart.  So I have
spoken!  And let the heavens tremble
at my might!"
698,COMMODUS,698,"This day I reclaim Rome for her
people.  I shall give you the
rebirth of your Empire!  Reborn and
cleansed of her enemies!"
699,COMMODUS,699,"I will make a new Rome!  Founded as
it was at the beginning!  Archers --
GIVE US BLOOD!"
700,MAXIMUS,700,"Throw down your weapons or we will
kill you."
701,MAXIMUS,701,"FELIX REGIMENT!  DO HONOR TO YOUR
ANCESTORS!  I SALUTE YOU!"
702,COMMODUS,702,"As it was at the beginning so is it
now.  The great She-Wolf of Rome
will again suckle us, again ravage
our enemies -- AND BRING US A WORLD
REBORN!"
703,COMMODUS,703,"So it was for Romulus and Remus,
sons of Mars, so shall it be for us!
The great She-Wolf will --"
704,LUCILLA,704,Remember your mother.
705,CENTURION BODY GUARD,705,Caesar -- we must go -- !
706,COMMODUS,706,GET THE BOY!
707,CENTURION BODY GUARD,707,"THIS WAY, CAESAR!"
708,MAXIMUS,708,Captain?
709,MAXIMUS,709,Where are they going?!
710,PROXIMO,710,This way!
711,COMMODUS,711,KILL THE BOY!
712,MAXIMUS,712,For my wife!
713,MAXIMUS,713,For my son!
714,MAXIMUS,714,For my father!
715,MAXIMUS,715,We who are about to die salute you.
716,GRACCHUS,716,"General, the purple is yours if you
so desire.  The Senate will support
you."
717,MAXIMUS,717,"Rome... you are better than this.
Look inside yourselves.  I challenge
you to find your true voice.  Help
the Senate speak for you.  Make them
your champion... And dare to think
what could be."
718,MAXIMUS,718,I give you back the dream.
719,MAXIMUS,719,"When everything has calmed down,
lead an orderly withdrawal.  Take
them home."
720,MAXIMUS,720,"It doesn't look it now... but soon
we'll have it growing again... Next
year there will be vines, and then
there will be grapes... It will be
alive."
