0,LUKE,0,"Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han,
old buddy, do you read me?"
1,HAN,1,"Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?"
2,LUKE,2,"Well, I finished my circle.  I
don't pick up any life readings."
3,HAN,3,"There isn't enough life on this
ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
The sensors are placed, I'm going
back."
4,LUKE,4,"Right.  I'll see you shortly.
There's a meteorite that hit the
ground near here.  I want to check
it out.  It won't take long."
5,LUKE,5,"Hey, steady girl.  What's the
matter?  You smell something?"
6,LUKE,6,Aaargh!
7,HAN,7,Chewie!
8,HAN,8,"All right, don't lose your temper.
I'll come right back and give you
a hand."
9,RIEEKAN,9,Solo?
10,RIEEKAN,10,Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
11,HAN,11,"No.  He's checking out a meteorite
that hit near him."
12,screen),12,"With all the meteor activity in this
system, it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships."
13,HAN,13,"General, I've got to leave.  I
can't stay anymore."
14,RIEEKAN,14,I'm sorry to hear that.
15,HAN,15,"Well, there's a price on my head.
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut,
I'm a dead man."
16,RIEEKAN,16,"A death mark's not an easy thing
to live with.  You're a good
fighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you."
17,HAN,17,"Thank you, General."
18,HAN,18,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this
is it."
19,LEIA,19,That's right.
20,HAN,20,"Well, don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess."
21,LEIA,21,Han!
22,HAN,22,"Yes, Your Highnessness?"
23,LEIA,23,I thought you decided to stay.
24,HAN,24,"Well, the bounty hunter we ran
into on Ord Mantell changed my
mind."
25,LEIA,25,"Han, we need you!"
26,HAN,26,We?
27,LEIA,27,Yes.
28,HAN,28,"Oh, what about you need?"
29,LEIA,29,"I need?  I don't know what you're
talking about."
30,fed up),30,You probably don't.
31,LEIA,31,"And what precisely am I supposed
to know?"
32,HAN,32,"Come on!  You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about
me."
33,LEIA,33,"Yes.  You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader..."
34,HAN,34,"No!  That's not it.  Come on.
Aahhh - uh huh!  Come on."
35,HAN,35,"Am I?  Then why are you following
me?  Afraid I was going to leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?"
36,LEIA,36,I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
37,HAN,37,"I can arrange that.  You could use
a good kiss!"
38,THREEPIO,38,"Don't try to blame me.  I didn't
ask you to turn on the thermal
heater.  I merely commented that it
was freezing in the princess'
chamber.  But it's supposed to be
freezing.  How are we going to dry
out all her clothes?  I really don't
know."
39,THREEPIO,39,"Oh, switch off."
40,HAN,40,"Why do you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here
and you pull both of these."
41,THREEPIO,41,"Excuse me, sir."
42,HAN,42,Put them back together right now.
43,THREEPIO,43,"Might I have a word with you,
please?"
44,HAN,44,What do you want?
45,THREEPIO,45,"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.
She's been trying to get you on
the communicator."
46,HAN,46,"I turned it off.  I don't want to
talk to her."
47,THREEPIO,47,"Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.  He hasn't come
back yet.  She doesn't know where he
is."
48,HAN,48,I don't know where he is.
49,THREEPIO,49,Nobody knows where he is.
50,HAN,50,"What do you mean, ""nobody knows""?"
51,THREEPIO,51,"Well, uh, you see..."
52,HAN,52,Deck Officer.  Deck Officer!
53,THREEPIO,53,"Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu..."
54,DECK OFFICER,54,"Yes, sir?"
55,HAN,55,"Do you know where Commander
Skywalker is?"
56,DECK OFFICER,56,"I haven't seen him.  It's possible
he came in through the south entrance."
57,HAN,57,"It's possible?  Why don't you go
find out?  It's getting dark out there."
58,DECK OFFICER,58,"Yes, sir."
59,THREEPIO,59,"Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire
what's going on?"
60,HAN,60,Why not?
61,THREEPIO,61,"Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo,
let's find Princess Leia.  Between
ourselves, I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger."
62,DECK OFFICER,62,"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't
come in through the south entrance.
He might have forgotten to check in."
63,HAN,63,Not likely.  Are the speeders ready?
64,DECK OFFICER,64,"Not yet.  We're having some trouble
adapting them to the cold."
65,HAN,65,"Then we'll have to go out on
Tauntauns."
66,DECK OFFICER,66,"Sir, the temperature's dropping too
rapidly."
67,HAN,67,"That's right.  And my friends out
in it."
68,ASSISTANT OFFICER,68,"I'll cover sector twelve.  Have
com-control set screen alpha."
69,DECK OFFICER,69,"Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you
reach the first marker."
70,HAN,70,Then I'll see you in hell!
71,THREEPIO,71,"You must come along now, Artoo.
There's really nothing more we can
do.  And my joints are freezing up."
72,THREEPIO,72,"Don't say thing like that!  Of
course we'll see Master Luke again.
He'll be quite all right, you'll see."
73,THREEPIO,73,"Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll
be quite all right."
74,LIEUTENANT,74,"Sir, all the patrols are in.
There's still no contact from
Skywalker or Solo."
75,THREEPIO,75,"Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals,
although he does admit that his own
range is far too weak to abandon
all hope."
76,DERLIN,76,"Your Highness, there's nothing
more we can do tonight.  The shield
doors must be closed."
77,DERLIN,77,Close the doors.
78,LIEUTENANT,78,"Yes, sir."
79,THREEPIO,79,"Artoo says the chances of survival
are seven hundred seventy-five...
to one."
80,THREEPIO,80,"Actually, Artoo has been known to
make mistakes... from time to time.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry
about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll
be all right.  He's quite clever,
you know... for a human being."
81,BEN,81,Luke... Luke.
82,LUKE,82,Ben?
83,BEN,83,You will go to the Dagobah system.
84,LUKE,84,Dagobah system?
85,BEN,85,"There you will learn from Yoda,
the Jedi Master who instructed me."
86,LUKE,86,Ben... Ben.
87,HAN,87,"Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.
Come on, give me a sign here."
88,HAN,88,Not much time.
89,LUKE,89,Ben... Ben...
90,HAN,90,"Hang on, kid."
91,LUKE,91,Dagobah system...
92,odor),92,Whew...
93,LUKE,93,Dagobah...
94,HAN,94,"This may smell bad, kid..."
95,LUKE,95,Yoda...
96,HAN,96,"...but it will keep you warm...
til I get the shelter built."
97,"Luke inside the
carcass)",97,"Ooh... I thought they smelled bad
on the outside!"
98,ZEV,98,"Echo Base... I've got something!  Not
much, but it could be a life form."
99,ZEV,99,"This is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue
Two.  Captain Solo, so you copy?
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
This is Rogue Two."
100,Zev's receiver),100,"Good morning.  Nice of you guys
to drop by."
101,ZEV,101,"Echo Base... this is Rogue Two.  I
found them.  Repeat, I found them."
102,THREEPIO,102,"Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again."
103,THREEPIO,103,"Artoo expresses his relief, also."
104,HAN,104,"How are you feeling, kid?  You
don't look so bad to me.  In
fact, you look strong enough to
pull the ears off a Gundark."
105,LUKE,105,Thanks to you.
106,HAN,106,"That's two you owe me, junior."
107,HAN,107,"Well your Worship, looks like
you managed to keep me around for
a little while longer."
108,LEIA,108,"I had nothing to do with it.  General
Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for
any ships to leave the system until
we've activated the energy shield."
109,HAN,109,"That's a good story.  I think you
just can't bear to let a gorgeous
guy like me out of your sight."
110,LEIA,110,"I don't know where you get your
delusions, laser brain."
111,HAN,111,"Laugh it up, fuzzball.  But you
didn't see us alone in the south
passage."
112,HAN,112,"She expressed her true feelings
for me."
113,LEIA,113,"My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half-
witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-
herder!"
114,HAN,114,Who's scruffy-looking?
115,HAN,115,"I must have hit pretty close to
the mark to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?"
116,LEIA,116,"Why, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet?"
117,ANNOUNCER,117,"Headquarters personnel, report to
command center."
118,HAN,118,Take it easy.
119,THREEPIO,119,"Excuse us, please."
120,RIEEKAN,120,Princess... we have a visitor.
121,RIEEKAN,121,"We've picked up something outside
the base in zone twelve, moving
east."
122,SENIOR CONTROLLER,122,It's metal.
123,LEIA,123,"Then it couldn't be one of those
creatures that attacked Luke."
124,HAN,124,"It could be a speeder, one of ours."
125,SENIOR CONTROLLER,125,"No.  Wait - there's something very
weak coming through."
126,THREEPIO,126,"Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.  This signal
is not used by the Alliance.  It
could be an Imperial code."
127,HAN,127,"It isn't friendly, whatever it is.
Come on, Chewie, let's check it out."
128,RIEEKAN,128,"Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to
station three-eight."
129,HAN,129,Afraid there's not much left.
130,LEIA,130,What was it?
131,HAN,131,"Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit
it that hard.  It must have had a
self-destruct."
132,LEIA,132,An Imperial probe droid.
133,HAN,133,"It's a good bet the Empire knows
we're here."
134,RIEEKAN,134,We'd better start the evacuation.
135,PIETT,135,Admiral.
136,OZZEL,136,"Yes, Captain"
137,PIETT,137,"I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment from
a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had."
138,OZZEL,138,"We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.  I want proof,
not leads!"
139,PIETT,139,The visuals indicate life readings.
140,OZZEL,140,"It could mean anything.  If we
followed every lead..."
141,PIETT,141,"But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed
to be devoid of human forms."
142,VADER,142,You found something?
143,PIETT,143,"Yes, my lord."
144,on the console screen),144,That's it.  The Rebels are there.
145,OZZEL,145,"My lord, there are so many uncharted
settlements.  It could be smugglers,
it could be..."
146,VADER,146,"That is the system.  And I'm sure
Skywalker is with them.  Set your
course for the Hoth system.  General
Veers, prepare you men."
147,REBEL CAPTAIN,147,"Groups seven and ten will stay
behind to fly the speeders.  As
soon as each transport is loaded,
evacuation control will give
clearance for immediate launch."
148,REBEL FIGHTER,148,"Right, sir."
149,Chewie),149,"Okay, that's it.  Try it... Off!
Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Off!"
150,MEDICAL DROID,150,"Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-forty- sevens."
151,LUKE,151,"Well, forget the heavy equipment.
There's plenty of time to get the
smaller modules on the transports."
152,MEDICAL DROID,152,"Take care, sir."
153,LUKE,153,Thanks.
154,LUKE,154,"Chewie, take care of yourself,
okay?"
155,HAN,155,"Hi, kid."
156,HAN,156,"There's got to be a reason for
it.  Check it at the other end.
Wait a second."
157,HAN,157,You all right?
158,LUKE,158,Yeah.
159,HAN,159,Be careful.
160,LUKE,160,"You, too."
161,CONTROLLER,161,"General, there's a fleet of Star
Destroyers coming out of hyperspace
in sector four."
162,RIEEKAN,162,"Reroute all power to the energy
shield.  We've got to hold them till
all transports are away.  Prepare
for ground assault."
163,VADER,163,"What is it, General?"
164,VEERS,164,"My lord, the fleet has moves out
of light-speed.  Com-Scan has
detected an energy field protecting
an area around the sixth planet of
the Hoth system.  The field is
strong enough to deflect any
bombardment."
165,VADER,165,"The Rebels are alerted to our
presence.  Admiral Ozzel came out
of light-speed too close to the
system."
166,VEERS,166,He felt surprise was wiser...
167,VADER,167,"He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
General, prepare your troops for a
surface attack."
168,VEERS,168,"Yes, my lord."
169,OZZEL,169,"Lord Vader, the fleet has moved
out of light-speed, and we're
preparing to... Aaagh!"
170,VADER,170,"You have failed me for the last
time, Admiral.  Captain Piett."
171,PIETT,171,"Yes, my lord."
172,PIETT,172,"Thank you, Lord Vader."
173,LEIA,173,"All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.  The heavy
transport ships will leave as
soon as they're loaded.  Only two
fighter escorts per ship.  The
energy shield can only be opened
for a short time, so you'll have
to stay very close to your transports."
174,HOBBIE,174,Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?
175,LEIA,175,"The ion cannon will fire several
shots to make sure that any enemy
ships will be out of your flight
path.  When you've gotten past the
energy shield, proceed directly to
the rendezvous point.  Understood?"
176,PILOTS,176,Right.  Okay.
177,LEIA,177,Good luck.
178,DERLIN,178,"Okay.  Everyone to your stations.
Let's go!"
179,RIEEKAN,179,"Their primary target will be the
power generators.  Prepare to
open the shield."
180,CONTROLLER,180,"Sir, Rebel ships are coming into
our sector."
181,CAPTAIN,181,Good.  Our first catch of the day.
182,WOMAN CONTROLLER,182,"Stand by, ion control... Fire!"
183,ANNOUNCER,183,The first transport is away.
184,DACK,184,"Feeling all right, sir?"
185,LUKE,185,"Just like new, Dack.  How about
you?"
186,DACK,186,"Right now I feel like I could take
on the whole Empire myself."
187,in),187,I know what you mean.
188,TRENCH OFFICER,188,Echo Station Three-T-Eight.
189,TRENCH OFFICER,189,We have spotted Imperial walkers!
190,LUKE,190,"Echo station Five-Seven.  We're
on our way."
191,LUKE,191,"All right, boys, keep tight now."
192,DACK,192,"Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set."
193,LUKE,193,"Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern
delta.  Go now!"
194,LUKE,194,"All right, I'm coming in."
195,LUKE,195,"Hobbie, you still with me?"
196,LUKE,196,"That armor's too strong for
blasters."
197,LUKE,197,"Rogue Group, use your harpoons
and tow cables.  Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance of
stopping them."
198,LUKE,198,"All right, stand by, Dack."
199,DACK,199,"Luke, we've got a malfunction in
fire control.  I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary."
200,LUKE,200,"Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get
ready to fire that tow cable."
201,LUKE,201,Dack?  Dack!
202,VEERS,202,"Yes, Lord Vader.  I've reached the
main power generator.  The shield
will be down in moments.  You may
start your landing."
203,LUKE,203,Rogue Three.
204,WEDGE,204,"Copy, Rogue Leader"
205,LUKE,205,"Wedge, I've lost my gunner.  You'll
have to make this shot.  I'll cover
for you.  Set your harpoon.  Follow
me on the next pass."
206,WEDGE,206,"Coming around, Rogue Leader."
207,LUKE,207,"Steady, Rogue Two"
208,WEDGE,208,Activate harpoon.
209,WEDGE,209,"Good shot, Janson."
210,WEDGE,210,One more pass.
211,JANSON,211,Coming around.  Once more.
212,JANSON,212,Once more.
213,JANSON,213,Cable out!  Let her go!
214,WEDGE,214,Detach cable.
215,JANSON,215,Cable detached.
216,TRENCH OFFICER,216,Come on!
217,WEDGE,217,Whooha!  That got him!
218,LUKE,218,"I see it, Wedge.  Good work."
219,RIEEKAN,219,"I don't think we can protect two
transports at a time."
220,LEIA,220,"It's risky, but we can't hold out
much longer.  We have no choice."
221,RIEEKAN,221,Launch patrols.
222,LEIA,222,Evacuate remaining ground staff.
223,HAN,223,"No, no!  No!  This one goes there,
that one goes there.  Right?"
224,THREEPIO,224,"Artoo, you take good care of
Master Luke now, understand?  And
... do take good care of yourself.
Oh, dear, oh, dear."
225,VEERS,225,"All troops will debark for ground
assault.  Prepare to target the
main generator."
226,LUKE,226,"Rogue Two, are you all right?"
227,ZEV,227,"Yeah.  I'm with you, Rogue Leader."
228,LUKE,228,We'll set harpoon.  I'll cover for you.
229,ZEV,229,Coming around.
230,LUKE,230,"Watch that cross fire, boys."
231,ZEV,231,Set for position three.
232,ZEV,232,Steady.
233,LUKE,233,Stay tight and low.
234,LUKE,234,"Hobbie, I've been hit!"
235,HAN,235,You all right?
236,LEIA,236,Why are you still here?
237,HAN,237,"I heard the command center had
been hit."
238,LEIA,238,You got your clearance to leave.
239,HAN,239,"Don't worry.  I'll leave.  First
I'm going to get you to your ship."
240,THREEPIO,240,"Your Highness, we must take this
last transport.  It's our only hope."
241,LEIA,241,"Send all troops in sector twelve
to the south slope to protect the
fighters."
242,ANNOUNCER,242,"Imperial troops have entered the
base."
243,HAN,243,Come on... that's it.
244,LEIA,244,"Give the evacuation code signal.
And get to your transports!"
245,HEAD CONTROLLER,245,K-one-zero... all troops disengage.
246,THREEPIO,246,Oh!  Wait for me!
247,OFFICER,247,Begin retreat!
248,SECOND OFFICER,248,Fall back!
249,VEERS,249,Distance to power generators?
250,PILOT,250,"One-seven, decimal two-eight."
251,VEERS,251,Target.  Maximum fire power.
252,HAN,252,"Transport, this is Solo.  Better
take off - I can't get to you.
I'll get the princess out on the
Falcon."
253,THREEPIO,253,"But... but... but... where are
you going?  Uh... come back!!"
254,THREEPIO,254,Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!
255,THREEPIO,255,How typical.
256,HAN,256,Come on.
257,HAN,257,"Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're
going to be a permanent resident!"
258,THREEPIO,258,Wait!  Wait!
259,HAN,259,How's this?
260,LEIA,260,"Would it helped if I got out and
pushed?"
261,HAN,261,It might.
262,THREEPIO,262,"Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir,
might I suggest that you..."
263,THREEPIO,263,It can wait.
264,LEIA,264,"This bucket of bolts is never going
to get us past that blockade."
265,HAN,265,"This baby's got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart."
266,HAN,266,"Come on!  Come on!  Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout."
267,HAN,267,See?
268,LEIA,268,"Someday you're going to be wrong,
and I hope I'm there to see it."
269,HAN,269,Punch it!
270,LUKE,270,Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.
271,WEDGE,271,"Good luck, Luke.  See you at
the rendezvous."
272,LUKE,272,"Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going,
we're going."
273,LUKE,273,"There's nothing wrong, Artoo.
I'm just setting a new course."
274,LUKE,274,"We're not going to regroup with
the others."
275,LUKE,275,We're going to the Dagobah system.
276,LUKE,276,"Yes, Artoo?"
277,LUKE,277,"That's all right.  I'd like to
keep it on manual control for a
while."
278,HAN,278,I saw them!  I saw them!
279,LEIA,279,Saw what?
280,HAN,280,"Star Destroyers, two of them,
coming right at us."
281,THREEPIO,281,"Sir, sir!  Might I suggest..."
282,HAN,282,Shut him up or shut him down!
283,HAN,283,Check the deflector shield!
284,HAN,284,"Oh, great.  Well, we can still
outmaneuver them."
285,IMPERIAL OFFICER,285,Take evasive action!
286,HAN,286,"Prepare to make the jump to light-
speed."
287,THREEPIO,287,"But, sir!"
288,LEIA,288,They're getting closer!
289,eye),289,Oh yeah?  Watch this.
290,LEIA,290,Watch what?
291,HAN,291,I think we're in trouble.
292,THREEPIO,292,"If I may say so, sir, I noticed
earlier that the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.  It's
impossible to go to light-speed!"
293,HAN,293,We're in trouble!
294,HAN,294,Horizontal boosters...!
295,HAN,295,"Alluvial dampers...!  Well that's
not it."
296,HAN,296,Bring me the hydrospanners!
297,HAN,297,"I don't know how we're going to
get out of this one."
298,HAN,298,Oww!  Chewie!
299,HAN,299,"That was no laser blast!  Something
hit us."
300,LEIA,300,"Han, get up here!"
301,HAN,301,"Come on, Chewie!"
302,LEIA,302,Asteroids!
303,HAN,303,"Oh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven-
one."
304,LEIA,304,"What are you doing?  You're not
actually going into an asteroid
field?"
305,HAN,305,"They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?"
306,LEIA,306,"You don't have to do this to
impress me."
307,THREEPIO,307,"Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field is
approximately three thousand, seven
hundred and twenty to one."
308,HAN,308,Never tell me the odds!
309,HAN,309,"You said you wanted to be around
when I made a mistake; well, this
could be it, sweetheart."
310,LEIA,310,"I take it back.  We're going to
get pulverized if we stay out here
much longer."
311,HAN,311,I'm not going to argue with that.
312,THREEPIO,312,Pulverized?
313,HAN,313,"I'm going in closer to one of
those big ones."
314,LEIA,314,Closer?
315,THREEPIO,315,Closer?!
316,THREEPIO,316,"Oh, this is suicide!"
317,HAN,317,There.  That looks pretty good.
318,LEIA,318,What looks pretty good?
319,HAN,319,Yeah.  That'll do nicely.
320,THREEPIO,320,"Excuse me, ma'am, but where are
we going?"
321,LEIA,321,I hope you know what you're doing.
322,HAN,322,"Yeah, me too."
323,LUKE,323,"Yes, that's it.  Dagobah."
324,LUKE,324,"No, I'm not going to change my
mind about this."
325,LUKE,325,"I'm not picking up any cities or
technology.  Massive life-form
readings, though.  There's something
alive down there..."
326,LUKE,326,"Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe
for droids."
327,LUKE,327,"I know, I know!  All the scopes are
dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just
hang on, I'm going to start the
landing cycle..."
328,LUKE,328,"No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll
have a look around."
329,LUKE,329,Artoo?
330,LUKE,330,Artoo!  Where are you?
331,LUKE,331,Artoo!  You be more careful.
332,LUKE,332,Artoo - that way!
333,LUKE,333,Artoo!
334,LUKE,334,"Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come
on.  You're lucky you don't taste
very good.  Anything broken?"
335,LUKE,335,"If you're saying coming here was
a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree
with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we
doing here?  It's like... something
out of a dream, or, I don't know.
Maybe I'm just going crazy."
336,VADER,336,"Yes, Admiral?"
337,VADER,337,"Asteroids do not concern me,
Admiral.  I want that ship and
not excuses."
338,PIETT,338,"Yes, lord."
339,HAN,339,"I'm going to shut down everything
but the emergency power systems."
340,THREEPIO,340,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,
but... does that include shutting
me down, too?"
341,HAN,341,"No, I need you to talk to the
Falcon, find out what's wrong with
the hyperdrive."
342,THREEPIO,342,"Sir, it's quite possible this
asteroid is not entirely stable."
343,HAN,343,"Not entirely stable?  I'm glad you're
here to tell us these things.  Chewie,
take the professor in the back and
plug him into the hyperdrive."
344,THREEPIO,344,"Oh!  Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.  After
all, I'm only trying to do my job
in the most..."
345,LEIA,345,Let go.
346,HAN,346,Sshh!
347,LEIA,347,"Let go, please."
348,HAN,348,Don't get excited.
349,LEIA,349,"Captain, being held by you isn't
quite enough to get me excited."
350,HAN,350,"Sorry, sweetheart.  We haven't
got time for anything else."
351,LUKE,351,"Ready for some power?  Okay.
Let's see now.  Put that in
there.  There you go."
352,LUKE,352,"Now all I have to do is find this
Yoda... if he even exists."
353,LUKE,353,"Still... there's something familiar
about this place.  I feel like...
I don't know..."
354,STRANGE VOICE,354,Feel like what?
355,creature),355,Like we're being watched!
356,CREATURE,356,"Away with your weapon!  I mean
you no harm."
357,CREATURE,357,"I am wondering, why are you here?"
358,LUKE,358,I'm looking for someone.
359,CREATURE,359,"Looking?  Found someone, you have,
I would say, hmmm?"
360,smiling),360,Right.
361,CREATURE,361,"Help you I can.  Yes, mmmm."
362,LUKE,362,"I don't think so.  I'm looking
for a great warrior."
363,CREATURE,363,Ahhh!  A great warrior.
364,his head),364,Wars not make one great.
365,LUKE,365,"Put that down.  Hey!  That's my
dinner!"
366,CREATURE,366,"How you get so big, eating food
of this kind?"
367,LUKE,367,"Listen, friend, we didn't mean to
land in that puddle, and if we
could get our ship out, we would,
but we can't, so why don't you just..."
368,CREATURE,368,"Aww, cannot get your ship out?"
369,LUKE,369,"Hey, you could have broken this.
Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're
making a mess.  Hey, give me that!"
370,the lamp),370,Mine!  Or I will help you not.
371,LUKE,371,"I don't want your help.  I want
my lamp back.  I'll need it to
get out of this slimy mudhole."
372,CREATURE,372,Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
373,CREATURE,373,"Ah, ah, ah!"
374,LUKE,374,"Oh, Artoo, let him have it!"
375,CREATURE,375,Mine!  Mine!
376,LUKE,376,Artoo!
377,CREATURE,377,Mine!
378,CREATURE,378,Mine!
379,LUKE,379,"Now will you move along, little
fella?  We're got a lot of work
to do."
380,CREATURE,380,"No!  No, no!  Stay and help you,
I will."
381,CREATURE,381,"Find your friend, hmm?"
382,LUKE,382,"I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi Master."
383,CREATURE,383,"Oohhh.  Jedi Master.  Yoda.  You
seek Yoda."
384,LUKE,384,You know him?
385,CREATURE,385,"Mmm.  Take you to him, I will."
386,CREATURE,386,"Yes, yes.  But now, we must eat.
Come.  Good food.  Come."
387,CREATURE,387,"Come, come."
388,LUKE,388,"Stay here and watch after the
camp, Artoo."
389,THREEPIO,389,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need
him?"
390,THREEPIO,390,"Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate, but it
has the most peculiar dialect.  I
believe, sir, it says that the
power coupling on the negative
axis has been polarized.  I'm
afraid you'll have to replace it."
391,HAN,391,"Well, of course I'll have to replace
it."
392,HAN,392,Here!  And Chewie...
393,HAN,393,"... I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling."
394,HAN,394,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only
trying to help."
395,LEIA,395,"Would you please stop calling me
that?"
396,HAN,396,"Sure, Leia."
397,LEIA,397,"Oh, you make it so difficult
sometimes."
398,HAN,398,"I do, I really do.  You could be
a little nicer, though."
399,reaction),399,"Come on, admit it.  Sometimes you
think I'm all right."
400,LEIA,400,Occasionally...
401,haltingly),401,"... when you aren't acting like
a scoundrel."
402,HAN,402,"Scoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like
the sound of that."
403,LEIA,403,Stop that.
404,HAN,404,Stop what?
405,LEIA,405,Stop that!  My hands are dirty.
406,HAN,406,"My hands are dirty, too.  What
are you afraid of?"
407,into his eyes),407,Afraid?
408,HAN,408,You're trembling.
409,LEIA,409,I'm not trembling.
410,HAN,410,"You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
There aren't enough scoundrels in
your life."
411,LEIA,411,I happen to like nice men.
412,HAN,412,I'm a nice man.
413,LEIA,413,"No, you're not.  You're..."
414,THREEPIO,414,"Sir, sir!  I've isolated the
reverse power flux coupling."
415,HAN,415,Thank you.  Thank you very much.
416,THREEPIO,416,"Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir."
417,NEEDA,417,"... and that, Lord Vader, was the
last time they appeared in any of
our scopes.  Considering the amount
of damage we've sustained, they
must have been destroyed."
418,VADER,418,"No, Captain, they're alive.  I
want every ship available to
sweep the asteroid field until
they are found."
419,VADER,419,"Yes, Admiral, what is it?"
420,PIETT,420,"The Emperor commands you make
contact with him."
421,VADER,421,"Move the ship out of the asteroid
field so that we can send a clear
transmission."
422,PIETT,422,"Yes, my lord."
423,VADER,423,"What is thy bidding, my master?"
424,EMPEROR,424,"There is a great disturbance in
the Force."
425,VADER,425,I have felt it.
426,EMPEROR,426,"We have a new enemy - Luke
Skywalker."
427,VADER,427,"Yes, my master."
428,EMPEROR,428,He could destroy us.
429,VADER,429,"He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no
longer help him."
430,EMPEROR,430,"The Force is strong with him.  The
son of Skywalker must not become a
Jedi."
431,VADER,431,"If he could be turned, he would
become a powerful ally."
432,EMPEROR,432,"Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great
asset.  Can it be done?"
433,VADER,433,"He will join us or die, my
master."
434,LUKE,434,"Look, I'm sure it's delicious.
I just don't understand why we
can't see Yoda now."
435,CREATURE,435,"Patience!  For the Jedi it is
time to eat as well.  Eat, eat.
Hot.  Good food, hm? Good, hmm?"
436,LUKE,436,"How far away is Yoda?  Will it
take us long to get there?"
437,CREATURE,437,"Not far.  Yoda not far.  Patience.
Soon you will be with him."
438,the pot),438,"Rootleaf, I cook.  Why wish you
become Jedi?  Hm?"
439,LUKE,439,"Mostly because of my father, I
guess."
440,CREATURE,440,"Ah, your father.  Powerful Jedi
was he, powerful Jedi, mmm."
441,LUKE,441,"Oh, come on.  How could you know
my father?  You don't even know
who I am."
442,LUKE,442,"Oh, I don't know what I'm doing
here.  We're wasting our time."
443,CREATURE,443,"I cannot teach him.  The boy has
no patience."
444,BEN'S VOICE,444,He will learn patience.
445,YODA,445,"Hmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father."
446,BEN'S VOICE,446,"Was I any different when you
taught me?"
447,YODA,447,Hah.  He is not ready.
448,LUKE,448,"Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I
can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm
ready."
449,YODA,449,"Ready, are you?  What know you
of ready?  For eight hundred years
have I trained Jedi.  My own counsel
will I keep on who is to be trained!
A Jedi must have the deepest
commitment, the most serious mind."
450,"Ben, indicating Luke)",450,"This one a long time have I watched.
All his life has he looked away...
to the future, to the horizon.
Never his mind on where he was.
Hmm?  What he was doing.  Hmph.
Adventure.  Heh!  Excitement.  Heh!
A Jedi craves not these things."
451,"Ben, indicating Luke)",451,You are reckless!
452,BEN'S VOICE,452,"So was I, if you'll remember."
453,YODA,453,"He is too old.  Yes, too old to
begin the training."
454,LUKE,454,But I've learned so much.
455,YODA,455,Will he finished what he begins?
456,LUKE,456,I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.
457,him),457,"Oh, you will be.  You will be."
458,THREEPIO,458,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion..."
459,HAN,459,"I'm not really interested in your
opinion, Threepio."
460,LEIA,460,There's something out there.
461,HAN,461,Where?
462,LEIA,462,"Outside, in the cave."
463,THREEPIO,463,There it is.  Listen!  Listen!
464,HAN,464,I'm going out there.
465,LEIA,465,Are you crazy?!
466,HAN,466,"I just got this bucket back
together.  I'm not going to let
something tear it apart."
467,LEIA,467,Then I'm going with you.
468,THREEPIO,468,"I think it might be better if I
stay here and guard the ship."
469,mysterious noise),469,"Oh, no."
470,LEIA,470,"This ground sure feels strange.
It doesn't feel like rock at all."
471,HAN,471,"There's an awful lot of moisture
in here."
472,LEIA,472,"I don't know.  I have a bad feeling
about this."
473,HAN,473,Yeah.
474,HAN,474,Watch out!
475,HAN,475,"Yeah, that's what I thought.
Mynock.  Chewie, check the rest
of the ship, make sure there
aren't any more attached.  They're
chewing on the power cables."
476,LEIA,476,Mynocks?
477,HAN,477,"Go on inside.  We'll clean them
off if there are any more."
478,THREEPIO,478,"Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly
little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!"
479,HAN,479,Wait a minute...
480,HAN,480,"All right, Chewie, let's get
out of here!"
481,LEIA,481,"The Empire is still out there.
I don't think it's wise to..."
482,HAN,482,"No time to discuss this in
committee."
483,LEIA,483,I am not a committee!
484,LEIA,484,"You can't make the jump to light-
speed in this asteroid field..."
485,HAN,485,"Sit down, sweetheart.  We're
taking off!"
486,THREEPIO,486,Look!
487,HAN,487,"I see it, I see it."
488,THREEPIO,488,We're doomed!
489,LEIA,489,The cave is collapsing.
490,HAN,490,This is no cave.
491,LEIA,491,What?
492,YODA,492,"Run!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.  But beware
of the dark side.  Anger... fear...
aggression.  The dark side of
the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join
you in a fight.  If once you
start down the dark path, forever
will it dominate your destiny,
consume you it will, as it did
Obi-Wan's apprentice."
493,LUKE,493,Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?
494,YODA,494,"No... no... no.  Quicker, easier,
more seductive."
495,LUKE,495,"But how am I to know the good side
from the bad?"
496,YODA,496,"You will know.  When you are calm,
at peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses
the Force for knowledge and
defense, never for attack."
497,LUKE,497,But tell me why I can't...
498,YODA,498,"No, no, there is no why.  Nothing
more will I teach you today.
Clear your mind of questions.
Mmm.  Mmmmmmmm."
499,LUKE,499,There's something not right here.
500,LUKE,500,"I feel cold, death."
501,YODA,501,"That place... is strong with the
dark side of the Force.  A domain
of evil it is.  In you must go."
502,LUKE,502,What's in there?
503,YODA,503,Only what you take with you.
504,YODA,504,"Your weapons... you will not
need them."
505,PIETT,505,"Bounty hunters.  We don't need
that scum."
506,FIRST CONTROLLER,506,"Yes, sir."
507,PIETT,507,Those Rebels won't escape us.
508,SECOND CONTROLLER,508,"Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer Avenger."
509,PIETT,509,Right.
510,VADER,510,"... there will be a substantial
reward for the one who finds the
Millennium Falcon.  You are free
to use any methods necessary, but
I want them alive.  No disintegrations."
511,BOBA FETT,511,As you wish.
512,PIETT,512,"Lord Vader!  My lord, we have
them."
513,THREEPIO,513,"Oh, thank goodness we're coming
out of the asteroid field."
514,HAN,514,"Let's get out of here.  Ready for
light-speed?  One... two... three!"
515,HAN,515,It's not fair!
516,HAN,516,"The transfer circuits are working.
It's not my fault!"
517,it),517,No light-speed?
518,HAN,518,It's not my fault.
519,THREEPIO,519,"Sir, we just lost the main rear
deflector shield.  One more direct
hit on the back quarter and we're
done for."
520,HAN,520,Turn her around.
521,HAN,521,"I said turn her around!  I'm
going to put all power in the
front shield."
522,LEIA,522,You're going to attack them?!
523,THREEPIO,523,"Sir, the odds of surviving a
direct assault on an Imperial
Star Destroyer..."
524,LEIA,524,Shut up!
525,NEEDA,525,"They're moving to attack
position!  Shields up!"
526,NEEDA,526,"Track them.  They may come
around for another pass."
527,TRACKING OFFICER,527,"Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes."
528,NEEDA,528,"They can't have disappeared.  No
ship that small has a cloaking
device."
529,TRACKING OFFICER,529,"Well, there's no trace of them,
sir."
530,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,530,"Captain, Lord Vader demands an
update on the pursuit."
531,NEEDA,531,"Get a shuttle ready.  I shall
assume full responsibility for
losing them, and apologize to Lord
Vader. Meanwhile, continue to
scan the area."
532,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,532,"Yes, Captain Needa."
533,YODA,533,Use the Force.  Yes...
534,YODA,534,Now... the stone.  Feel it.
535,YODA,535,Concentrate!
536,LUKE,536,"Oh, no.  We'll never get it out
now."
537,YODA,537,"So certain are you.  Always with
you it cannot be done.  Hear you
nothing that I say?"
538,LUKE,538,"Master, moving stones around is
one thing.  This is totally
different."
539,YODA,539,"No!  No different!  Only different
in your mind.  You must unlearn
what you have learned."
540,LUKE,540,"All right, I'll give it a try."
541,YODA,541,"No!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.
There is no try."
542,LUKE,542,I can't.  It's too big.
543,YODA,543,"Size matters not.  Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?
Hm?  Mmmm."
544,YODA,544,"And well you should not.  For my
ally in the Force.  And a powerful
ally it is.  Life creates it, makes
it grow.  Its energy surrounds us
and binds us.  Luminous beings
are we..."
545,Luke's shoulder),545,... not this crude matter.
546,Luke's shoulder),546,You must feel the Force around you.
547,Luke's shoulder),547,"Here, between you... me... the
tree... the rock... everywhere!
Yes, even between this land and
that ship!"
548,LUKE,548,You want the impossible.
549,LUKE,549,I don't... I don't believe it.
550,YODA,550,That is why you fail.
551,VADER,551,"Apology accepted, Captain Needa."
552,PIETT,552,"Lord Vader, our ships have
completed their scan of the area
and found nothing.  If the
Millennium Falcon went into light-
speed, it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy by now."
553,VADER,553,"Alert all commands.  Calculate
every possible destination along
their last know trajectory."
554,PIETT,554,"Yes, my lord.  We'll find them."
555,VADER,555,"Don't fail me again, Admiral."
556,PIETT,556,Alert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.
557,THREEPIO,557,"Captain Solo, this time you have
gone too far."
558,THREEPIO,558,"No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?"
559,HAN,559,"The fleet is beginning to break
up.  Go back and stand by the
manual release for the landing claw."
560,THREEPIO,560,"I really don't see how that is
going to help.  Surrender is a
perfectly acceptable alternative
in extreme circumstances.  The
Empire may be gracious enough..."
561,HAN,561,Thank you.
562,LEIA,562,"What did you have in mind for
your next move?"
563,HAN,563,"Well, if they follow standard
Imperial procedure, they'll dump
their garbage before they go to
light-speed, then we just float
away."
564,LEIA,564,"With the rest of the garbage.
Then what?"
565,HAN,565,"Then we've got to find a safe
port somewhere around here.  Got
any ideas?"
566,LEIA,566,No.  Where are we?
567,HAN,567,The Anoat system.
568,LEIA,568,"Anoat system.  There's not much
there."
569,HAN,569,"No.  Well, wait.  This is
interesting.  Lando."
570,LEIA,570,Lando system?
571,HAN,571,"Lando's not a system, he's a man.
Lando Calrissian.  He's a card
player, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd
like him."
572,LEIA,572,Thanks.
573,HAN,573,"Bespin.  It's pretty far, but I
think we can make it."
574,computer),574,A mining colony?
575,HAN,575,"Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando
conned somebody out of it.  We
go back a long way, Lando and me."
576,LEIA,576,Can you trust him?
577,HAN,577,"No.  But he has no love for the
Empire, I can tell you that."
578,HAN,578,"Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by.
Detach!"
579,LEIA,579,"You do have your moments.  Not
many, but you have them."
580,YODA,580,"Concentrate... feel the Force
flow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm, yes.
Through the Force, things you
will see.  Other places.  The
future... the past.  Old friends
long gone."
581,LUKE,581,Han!  Leia!
582,YODA,582,"Hmm.  Control, control.  You must
learn control."
583,LUKE,583,"I saw... I saw a city in the
clouds."
584,YODA,584,Mmm.  Friends you have there.
585,LUKE,585,They were in pain.
586,LUKE,586,Future?  Will they die?
587,YODA,587,"Difficult to see.  Always in
motion is the future."
588,LUKE,588,I've got to go to them.
589,YODA,589,"Decide you must how to serve
them best.  If you leave now,
help them you could.  But you
would destroy all for which they
have fought and suffered."
590,HAN,590,"No, I don't have a landing
permit.  I'm trying to reach
Lando Calrissian."
591,HAN,591,"Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me
explain."
592,INTERCOM VOICE,592,"You will not deviate from your
present course."
593,THREEPIO,593,"Rather touchy, aren't they?"
594,LEIA,594,I thought you knew this person.
595,HAN,595,"Well, that was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about
that."
596,INTERCOM VOICE,596,"Permission granted to land on
Platform Three-two-seven."
597,HAN,597,Thank you.
598,HAN,598,"There's nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me."
599,LEIA,599,Who's worried?
600,THREEPIO,600,Oh.  No one to meet us.
601,LEIA,601,I don't like this.
602,HAN,602,"Well, what would you like?"
603,THREEPIO,603,"Well, they did let us land."
604,HAN,604,"Look, don't worry.  Everything's
going to be fine.  Trust me."
605,HAN,605,See?  My friend.
606,HAN,606,"Keep your eyes open, okay?"
607,LANDO,607,"Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler!  You've got a
lot of guts coming here, after
what you pulled."
608,LANDO,608,"How you doing, you old pirate?
So good to see you!  I never thought
I'd catch up with you again.  Where
you been?"
609,LEIA,609,Yes... very friendly.
610,LANDO,610,What are you doing here?
611,the Falcon),611,"Ahh... repairs.  I thought you
could help me out."
612,LANDO,612,What have you done to my ship?
613,HAN,613,"Your ship?  Hey, remember, you
lost her to me fair and square."
614,LANDO,614,"Hello.  What have we here?
Welcome.  I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this
facility.  And who might you be?"
615,LEIA,615,Leia.
616,LANDO,616,"Welcome, Leia."
617,HAN,617,"All right, all right, you old
smoothie."
618,THREEPIO,618,"Hello, sir.  I am See-Threepio,
human-cyborg relations.  My
facilities are at your..."
619,THREEPIO,619,"Well, really!"
620,LANDO,620,What's wrong with the Falcon?
621,HAN,621,Hyperdrive.
622,LANDO,622,I'll get my people to work on it.
623,HAN,623,Good.
624,LANDO,624,"You know, that ship saved my life
quite a few times.  She's the
fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy."
625,HAN,625,"How's the gas mine?  Is it
paying off for you?"
626,LANDO,626,"Oh, not as well as I'd like.
We're a small outpost and not
very self-sufficient.  And I've
had supply problems of every kind.
I've had labor difficulties..."
627,grinning at him),627,What's so funny?
628,HAN,628,"You.  Listen to you - you sound
like a businessman, a responsible
leader.  Who'd have thought that,
huh?"
629,LANDO,629,"You know, seeing you sure
brings back a few things."
630,HAN,630,Yeah.
631,LANDO,631,"Yeah.  I'm responsible these days.
It's the price you pay for being
successful."
632,THREEPIO,632,Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face.
633,SECOND THREEPIO,633,E chu ta!
634,THREEPIO,634,How rude!
635,THREEPIO,635,"That sounds like an R2 unit in
there.  I wonder if..."
636,THREEPIO,636,"Hello?  How interesting.  Oh, my."
637,MAN'S VOICE,637,Who are you?
638,THREEPIO,638,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I
didn't mean to intrude.  No, no,
please don't get up.  No!"
639,YODA,639,"Luke!  You must complete the
training."
640,LUKE,640,"I can't keep the vision out of my
head.  They're my friends.  I've
got to help them."
641,YODA,641,You must not go!
642,LUKE,642,"But Han and Leia will die if I
don't."
643,BEN'S VOICE,643,You don't know that.
644,BEN,644,Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
645,LUKE,645,"But I can help them!  I feel
the Force!"
646,BEN,646,"But you cannot control it.  This
is a dangerous time for you,
when you will be tempted by the
dark side of the Force."
647,YODA,647,"Yes, yes.  To Obi-Wan you listen.
The cave.  Remember your failure
at the cave!"
648,LUKE,648,"But I've learned so much since
then.  Master Yoda, I promise to
return and finish what I've begun.
You have my word."
649,BEN,649,"It is you and your abilities the
Emperor wants.  that is why your
friends are made to suffer."
650,LUKE,650,And that is why I have to go.
651,BEN,651,"Luke, I don't want to lose you to
the Emperor the way I lost Vader."
652,LUKE,652,You won't.
653,YODA,653,"Stopped they must be.  On this
all depends.  Only a fully trained
Jedi Knight with the Force as his
ally will conquer Vader and his
Emperor.  If you end your training
now, if you choose the quick and
easy path, as Vader did, you will
become an agent of evil."
654,BEN,654,Patience.
655,LUKE,655,And sacrifice Han and Leia?
656,YODA,656,"If you honor what they fight for
... yes!"
657,BEN,657,"If you choose to face Vader, you
will do it alone.  I cannot
interfere."
658,LUKE,658,I understand.
659,X-wing),659,"Artoo, fire up the converters."
660,BEN,660,"Luke, don't give in to hate -
that leads to the dark side."
661,YODA,661,"Strong is Vader.  Mind what you
have learned.  Save you it can."
662,LUKE,662,I will.  And I'll return.  I promise.
663,YODA,663,"Told you, I did.  Reckless is
he.  Now matters are worse."
664,BEN,664,That boy is our last hope.
665,YODA,665,No.  There is another.
666,HAN,666,"The ship is almost finished.
Two or Three more things and
we're in great shape."
667,LEIA,667,"The sooner the better.  Something's
wrong here.  No one has seen or
knows anything about Threepio.
He's been gone too long to have
gotten lost."
668,HAN,668,"Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and
see what I can find out."
669,LEIA,669,I don't trust Lando.
670,HAN,670,"Well, I don't trust him, either.
But he is my friend.  Besides,
we'll soon be gone."
671,LEIA,671,"And then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?"
672,LEIA,672,What happened?
673,HAN,673,Where?  Found him in a junk pile?
674,LEIA,674,"Oh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you
think you can repair him?"
675,HAN,675,"Lando's got people who can fix
him."
676,LEIA,676,"No, thanks."
677,LANDO,677,"I'm sorry.  Am I interrupting
anything?"
678,LEIA,678,Not really.
679,LANDO,679,"You look absolutely beautiful.
You truly belong here with us
among the clouds."
680,LEIA,680,Thank you.
681,LANDO,681,"Will you join me for a little
refreshment?"
682,LANDO,682,"Everyone's invited, of course."
683,LANDO,683,Having trouble with you droid?
684,HAN,684,No.  No problem.  Why?
685,LANDO,685,"So you see, since we're a small
operation, we don't fall into
the... uh... jurisdiction of the
Empire."
686,LEIA,686,"So you're part of the mining
guild then?"
687,LANDO,687,"No, not actually.  Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed...
which is advantageous for everybody
since our customers are anxious
to avoid attracting attention to
themselves."
688,HAN,688,"Aren't you afraid the Empire's
going to find out about this
little operation and shut you down?"
689,LANDO,689,"That's always been a danger looming
like a shadow over everything we've
built here.  But things have
developed that will insure security.
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever."
690,VADER,690,"We would be honored if you would
join us."
691,LANDO,691,I had no choice.  They arrived
692,HAN,692,"I'm sorry, too."
693,LUKE,693,"No, Threepio's with them."
694,LUKE,694,Just hang on.  We're almost there.
695,THREEPIO,695,"Mmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take
this off!  I, uh, don't mean to
intrude here.  I, don't, no, no,
no... Please don't get up.  No!"
696,THREEPIO,696,"Stormtroopers?  Here?  We're in
danger.  I must tell the others.
Oh, no!  I've been shot!"
697,LANDO,697,Lord Vader.
698,VADER,698,"You may take Captain Solo to
Jabba the Hut after I have
Skywalker."
699,BOBA FETT,699,He's no good to me dead.
700,VADER,700,He will not be permanently damaged.
701,LANDO,701,"Lord Vader, what about Leia and
the Wookiee?"
702,VADER,702,"They must never again leave this
city."
703,LANDO,703,"That was never a condition of our
agreement, nor was giving Han to
this bounty hunter!"
704,VADER,704,"Perhaps you think you're being
treated unfairly."
705,LANDO,705,No.
706,VADER,706,"Good.  It would be unfortunate if
I had to leave a garrison here."
707,LANDO,707,"This deal's getting worse all
the time."
708,THREEPIO,708,"Oh, yes, that's very good.  I like
that.  Oh!  Something's not right
because now I can't see.  Wait.
Wait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?
I'm backwards, you stupid furball.
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough..."
709,HAN,709,I feel terrible.
710,LEIA,710,Why are they doing this?
711,HAN,711,"They never even asked me any
questions."
712,LEIA,712,Lando.
713,HAN,713,"Get out of here, Lando!"
714,LANDO,714,"Shut up and listen!  Vader has
agreed to turn Leia and Chewie
over to me."
715,HAN,715,Over to you?
716,LANDO,716,"They'll have to stay here, but at
least they'll be safe."
717,LEIA,717,What about Han?
718,LANDO,718,"Vader's giving him to the bounty
hunter."
719,LEIA,719,Vader wants us all dead.
720,LANDO,720,"He doesn't want you at all.  He's
after somebody called Skywalker."
721,HAN,721,Luke?
722,LANDO,722,Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
723,LEIA,723,And we're the bait.
724,LANDO,724,"Well, he's on his way."
725,HAN,725,"Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty
good, didn't you?"
726,HAN,726,My friend!
727,LANDO,727,"Stop!  I've done all I can.  I'm
sorry I couldn't do better, but
I have my own problems."
728,HAN,728,"Yeah, you're a real hero."
729,LEIA,729,"You certainly have a way with
people."
730,VADER,730,"This facility is crude, but it
should be adequate to freeze
Skywalker for his journey to the
Emperor."
731,IMPERIAL SOLDIER,731,"Lord Vader, ship approaching.
X-wing class."
732,VADER,732,"Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow
him to land."
733,LANDO,733,"Lord Vader, we only use this
facility for carbon freezing.  If
you put him in there, it might
kill him."
734,VADER,734,"I do not want the Emperor's prize
damaged.  We will test it... on
Captain Solo."
735,THREEPIO,735,"If only you had attached my legs,
I wouldn't be in this ridiculous
position.  Now, remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility to me,
so don't do anything foolish."
736,HAN,736,What's going on... buddy?
737,LANDO,737,You're being put into carbon freeze.
738,BOBA FETT,738,"What if he doesn't survive?  He's
worth a lot to me."
739,VADER,739,"The Empire will compensate you
if he dies.  Put him in!"
740,THREEPIO,740,"Oh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop,
Chewbacca, stop...!"
741,HAN,741,"Stop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear
me?  Stop!"
742,THREEPIO,742,"Yes, stop, please!  I'm not ready
to die."
743,HAN,743,"Chewie!  Chewie, this won't help
me.  Hey!"
744,HAN,744,"Save your strength.  There'll be
another time.  The princess - you
have to take care of her.  You
hear me?"
745,LEIA,745,I love you!
746,HAN,746,I know.
747,THREEPIO,747,"What... what's going on?  Turn
round, Chewbacca, I can't see.
Oh... they've encased him in
carbonite.  He should be quite
well-protected - if he survives
the freezing process, that is."
748,VADER,748,"Well, Calrissian, did he survive?"
749,LANDO,749,"Yes, he's alive.  And in perfect
hibernation."
750,VADER,750,"He's all yours bounty hunter.
Reset the chamber for Skywalker."
751,IMPERIAL OFFICER,751,"Skywalker has just landed, my
lord."
752,VADER,752,"Good.  See to it that he finds
his way here.  Calrissian, take
the princess and the Wookiee to
my ship."
753,LANDO,753,"You said they'd be left in the
city under my supervision."
754,VADER,754,"I am altering the deal.  Pray I
don't alter it any further."
755,LEIA,755,"Luke!  Luke, don't - it's a
trap!  It's a trap!"
756,VADER,756,"The Force is with you, young
Skywalker.  But you are not a
Jedi yet."
757,LANDO,757,"Well done.  Hold them in the
security tower - and keep it
quiet.  Move."
758,LEIA,758,What do you think you're doing?
759,LANDO,759,We're getting out of here.
760,THREEPIO,760,"I knew all along it had to be a
mistake."
761,LEIA,761,"Do you think that after what you
did to Han we're going to trust
you?"
762,LANDO,762,I had no choice...
763,THREEPIO,763,"What are you doing?  Trust him,
trust him!"
764,LEIA,764,"Oh, so we understand, don't we,
Chewie?  He had no choice."
765,LANDO,765,I'm just trying to help...
766,LEIA,766,We don't need any of your help.
767,LANDO,767,H-a-a-a...
768,LEIA,768,What?
769,THREEPIO,769,It sounds like Han.
770,LANDO,770,"There's still a chance to save
Han... I mean, at the East
Platform..."
771,LEIA,771,Chewie.
772,THREEPIO,772,"I'm terribly sorry about all this.
After all, he's only a Wookiee."
773,BOBA FETT,773,"Put Captain Solo in the cargo
hold."
774,THREEPIO,774,"Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you
been?"
775,THREEPIO,775,"Turn around, you wooly...!"
776,THREEPIO,776,"Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to
save Han from the bounty hunter!"
777,THREEPIO,777,"Well, at least your still in
one piece!  Look what happened to
me!"
778,THREEPIO,778,"Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind
you!"
779,VADER,779,"You have learned much, young one."
780,LUKE,780,You'll find I'm full of surprises.
781,VADER,781,"Your destiny lies with me,
Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to
be true."
782,LUKE,782,No!
783,VADER,783,"All to easy.  Perhaps you are not
as strong as the Emperor thought."
784,VADER,784,Impressive... most impressive.
785,VADER,785,"Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You
have controlled your fear... now
release your anger."
786,VADER,786,Only your hatred can destroy me.
787,LANDO,787,The security codes has been changed!
788,THREEPIO,788,"Artoo, you can tell the computer
to override the security system."
789,LANDO,789,"Attention!  This is Lando
Calrissian.  The Empire has takes
control of the city.  I advise
everyone to leave before more
Imperial troops arrive."
790,LANDO,790,This way.
791,THREEPIO,791,"Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter.
I'm not supposed to know a power
socket from a computer terminal."
792,THREEPIO,792,"What are you talking about?  We're
not interested in the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon.  It's
fixed!  Just open the door, you
stupid lump."
793,THREEPIO,793,"I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!"
794,THREEPIO,794,"Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend
down, you thoughtless... Ow!"
795,LANDO,795,Leia!  Go!
796,THREEPIO,796,"I thought that hairy beast would
be the end of me.  Of course, I've
looked better."
797,VADER,797,"You are beaten.  It is useless
to resist.  Don't let yourself
be destroyed as Obi-Wan did."
798,VADER,798,"There is no escape.  Don't make
me destroy you.  You do not yet
realize your importance.  You
have only begun to discover your
power.  Join me and I will complete
your training.  With our combined
strength, we can end this destructive
conflict and bring order to the
galaxy."
799,LUKE,799,I'll never join you!
800,VADER,800,"If you only knew the power of the
dark side.  Obi-Wan never told
you what happened to your father."
801,LUKE,801,"He told me enough!  It was you
who killed him."
802,VADER,802,No.  I am your father.
803,LUKE,803,"No.  No.  That's not true!
That's impossible!"
804,VADER,804,"Search your feelings.  You know
it to be true."
805,LUKE,805,No!  No!  No!
806,VADER,806,"Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
He has foreseen this.  It is your
destiny.  Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy as father
and son.  Come with me.  It is the
only way."
807,LUKE,807,"Ben... Ben, please!"
808,LUKE,808,Ben.  Leia!
809,LUKE,809,Hear me!  Leia!
810,LEIA,810,Luke... We've got to go back.
811,LANDO,811,What?
812,LEIA,812,I know where Luke is.
813,LANDO,813,But what about those fighter?
814,LEIA,814,"Chewie, just do it."
815,LANDO,815,But what about Vader?
816,LANDO,816,"All right, all right, all right."
817,VADER,817,Bring my shuttle.
818,cockpit window),818,"Look, someone's up there."
819,LEIA,819,"It's Luke.  Chewie, slow down.
Slow down and we'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch."
820,LEIA,820,"Okay.  Easy, Chewie."
821,LEIA,821,Lando?
822,LANDO,822,"Okay, let's go."
823,LUKE,823,"Oh, Leia."
824,LANDO,824,"All right, Chewie.  Let's go."
825,LEIA,825,I'll be back.
826,LEIA,826,Star Destroyer.
827,LANDO,827,"All right, Chewie.  Ready for
light-speed."
828,LEIA,828,"If your people fixed the
hyperdrive."
829,LEIA,829,"All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never."
830,LANDO,830,Punch it!
831,LANDO,831,"They told me they fixed it.  I
trusted them to fix it.  It's not
my fault!"
832,PIETT,832,"They'll be in range of our
tractor beam in moments, my lord."
833,VADER,833,"Did your men deactivate the
hyperdrive on the Millennium
Falcon?"
834,PIETT,834,"Yes, my lord."
835,VADER,835,"Good.  Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun."
836,PIETT,836,"Yes, my lord."
837,THREEPIO,837,"Noisy brute.  Why don't we just
go into light-speed?"
838,THREEPIO,838,"We can't?  How would you know the
hyperdrive is deactivated?"
839,THREEPIO,839,"The city's central computer told
you?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.
Ouch!  Pay attention to what
you're doing!"
840,VADER,840,Luke.
841,LUKE,841,Father.
842,VADER,842,"Son, come with me."
843,LUKE,843,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
844,LANDO,844,Chewie!
845,LUKE,845,It's Vader.
846,VADER,846,Luke... it is your destiny.
847,LUKE,847,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
848,PIETT,848,"Alert all commands.  Ready for

that bounty hunter, we'll contact
you."

point on Tatooine."
855,LANDO,855,"Princess, we'll find Han.  I
promise."

Force be with you."
