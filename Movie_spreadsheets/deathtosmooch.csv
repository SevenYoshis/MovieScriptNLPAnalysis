0,RANDOLPH,0,"'Friends come in all sizes
That's a fact! It's True!
All colors of the rainbow"
1,RANDOLPH (CONT'D),1,"Their names may not be different
and their shoes may not match
One might say 'grasp' while the
other says 'snatch'
Some like to toss while others
like to caaaaatch... Beeee-
caaaause...
Friends come in all sizes
Take it from me! Golly Gee! Size
never matters when you want some
friendly patter
From a pal who is true and can
lift you when you're blue
You can count on him and he can
count on yoooouuuu!
It's true... that..."
2,RANDOLPH (CONT'D),2,Friends come in all sizes!'
3,HUSBAND,3,"So... uh... you'll make sure my
boy dances up front, right? Where
he'll get the most camera time?"
4,RANDOLPH,4,You want your kid on the show?
5,HUSBAND,5,Of... of course.
6,WIFE,6,"Yes, very much."
7,RANDOLPH,7,"Then don't tell me how to run my
fucking business."
8,HUSBAND,8,"No, no, we were just --"
9,RANDOLPH,9,I'll call you if a spot opens up.
10,HUSBAND,10,"Freeze, you cocksucker!"
11,WIFE,11,Drop the briefcase!
12,STOKES,12,"(addressing the brass)
Gentlemen, let me be the first to
say, in all sobriety, that I'm as
shocked and outraged as all of --"
13,STOKES,13,"Save it for the papers, Stokes.
We've got nervous sponsors and an
angry public -- a combination
uglier than two monkeys fucking.
What are you doing about it?"
14,STOKES,14,"Well, sir, I'm currently in the
process of compiling a list of
viable replacements and it's my
hope..."
15,STOKES,15,"Clean replacements?    With
background checks? I assure you,
Mr. Stokes, this network cannot
survive another Rainbow Randolph.
The goddamn P.R. department looks
like the Jim Jones camp."
16,STOKES,16,"Remember, Stokes, this was your
dog that crapped on our rug."
17,EXECUTIVE #2,17,"We trusted you, Frank. And now
we're in a tight spot. We have to
post our quarterly earnings next
month, for Christ's sake."
18,CEO,18,"Whoever takes that slot has to be
a straight arrow. Clean as a
whistle."
19,CEO,19,"Right. Someone who'll take the
heat off. One of those sweater
types. Any chance of luring Fred
Rogers away from P.B.S.?"
20,EXECUTIVE #4,20,"Yeah, if we back up the Brinks
truck."
21,EXECUTIVE #1,21,"No way. The idea now is to stop
the hemorrhaging."
22,EXECUTIVE #2,22,"You better fix this, Stokes. Get
us a white bread replacement,
fast. Bland, milk toast. Not a
speck of controversy."
23,CEO,23,Squeaky fucking clean.
24,STOKES,24,Bumble Bee Billy?
25,NORA,25,Wife beater.
26,STOKES,26,Square Dance Danny?
27,NORA,27,"Still appealing the mail fraud
thing."
28,STOKES,28,Skippy Black and the Tippy Trolls?
29,NORA,29,"Black was deported, and the
trolls... well, who gives a shit."
30,NORA,30,"This is impossible. If I ever see
that Rainbow Randolph again I'll
strangle him. Choke the life out
of him. Squeeze his scrawny neck
until his eyes pop out of his
skull and bounce off the walls..."
31,STOKES,31,"Before indulging such cheery
fantasies, let's just concentrate
on saving my job. Shall we?"
32,NORA,32,"Sorry, Frank."
33,STOKES,33,"What's going on with Sheldon Mopes
these days."
34,NORA,34,"Oh my God. Have we sunk to that
level already? Smoochy the Rhino?
What a sap."
35,STOKES,35,"Sap's just the pill we need right
now. Mopes is a straight arrow.
Always has been."
36,NORA,36,"The guy can't get arrested, Frank.
He can't even break into the
birthday party circuit. Last I
heard he was working hospitals and
nursing homes. He's a joke."
37,STOKES,37,"The truth of the matter is, a
successful children's show has
always depended on two simple
elements: a fuzzy costume and a
lot of hype. Strip away the foam
rubber and the network money and
they're all jokes. Marginal
talents.. cabaret acts... off-
Broadway runoff..."
38,NORA,38,"I probably have ten acts in my
development file -- acts I've been
cultivating -- that are more
deserving than Sheldon Mopes."
39,STOKES,39,"And each one a moral question
mark. Something I can't risk at
the moment."
40,NORA,40,"We can do better than this guy,
Frank. He brings nothing to the
table."
41,STOKES,41,"Except ethics. With Mopes,
there's never been a whiff of
controversy. The man's an
ethical, harmless, cornball. In
short, a glass of milk on two
legs."
42,NORA,42,"Don't ask me to do it. You know
I'll do anything for you, but
please... not this..."
43,STOKES,43,Go find Smoochy.
44,SMOOCHY (SHELDON),44,"'We'll get that monkey off your
back,
Yes we will, yes we will
We'll get that monkey off your
back,
Yes we will...'
'We'll get that monkey off your
back
And get your life right back on
track
If you'll just give up the smack
Yes you will, yes you will!!'"
45,SMOOCHY,45,"Thanks, fellas. I'm rooting for
you!"
46,NORA,46,Mr. Mopes?
47,SHELDON,47,Yeah?
48,NORA,48,"I, uh, saw your performance
tonight. Very..."
49,NORA,49,... spirited.
50,SHELDON,50,"Really? Thanks. I would've done
a longer set if that guy hadn't
pulled a knife on the security
guard. Once the pepper spray
starts flyin', that's it for the
encores."
51,NORA,51,"Yes, that did put a damper on the
evening, didn't it?"
52,SHELDON,52,"Are you a new patient?   On the
juice, as we say?"
53,NORA,53,"Ah, no. But it's sweet of you to
assume so."
54,SHELDON,54,"'Nora Bishop. V.P. of
Development. Kidnet.'"
55,SHELDON,55,Good gravy. You work for Kidnet?
56,NORA,56,As stated.
57,SHELDON,57,"Well, it's a pleasure to meet you,
Nora. A real honor. Hey, you
hungry?"
58,SHELDON,58,"Soy dogs... never thought I'd
live to see the day. Organic,
rich in natural protein, and
nobody gets killed. Although I
do feel bad for the beans. Just
kidding. Sure you don't want one?"
59,NORA,59,"Believe it or not, no."
60,SHELDON,60,"So anyway, like I was saying,
people always tell me, 'You gotta
network, Sheldon... you gotta sell
yourself... or you'll be playing
the drug clinics and shopping
centers the rest of your life.'
And you know what I tell 'em?"
61,NORA,61,I haven't the foggiest.
62,SHELDON,62,"I tell 'em, it's not about the old
handshake and back slap game.
It's not about adding fuel to the
shlock machine. It's about doing
good work. Having integrity.
Making people happy and delivering
a positive message. Foundations
are built with concrete, not
plaster of Paris!"
63,SHELDON,63,"This is concrete!   This is
integrity!"
64,NORA,64,I can see that.
65,SHELDON,65,"Sorry. As you can imagine, living
by your convictions can be a
little stressful at times."
66,NORA,66,We all have our cross to bear.
67,SHELDON,67,"See, I was raised by my
grandfather, and Grandpop paved
driveways for a living..."
68,NORA,68,Are we going into a story?
69,SHELDON,69,"Thing is, he didn't really pave
them. Just covered them with
black paint. Of course, once the
first rain came along, people
realized they'd been swindled. I
vowed to myself back then that I'd
never make a living through
deception. Never. Whadda ya
think of them apples?"
70,NORA,70,"The reason I'm here today, Mr.
Mopes, as fate would have it,
Kidnet is currently looking for a
performer with... convictions.
And integrity. Someone like..."
71,NORA,71,... yourself.
72,SHELDON,72,"Yeah, right. Got any more jokes?"
73,NORA,73,"I don't think I could top that
one."
74,SHELDON,74,"Hold the phone. You're telling me
that Kidnet is finally ready to do
a show of Smoochy quality? Of
Smoochy caliber?"
75,NORA,75,"Yes... I believe we're ready to
push ourselves to that level."
76,SHELDON,76,"I knew this day   would come!
After all these   years I finally
meet someone in   the business who
gets what I do.    Who gets what I'm
all about. You    get me, don't you,
Nora?"
77,NORA,77,I'm afraid so.
78,SHELDON,78,"Well, Miss V.P. of Development...
let's go make history!"
79,SMOOCHY,79,"Angelo, you were always my favorite
Krinkle Kid. The way you'd click
your heels during the 'Jellybean
Jam.' Real artistry. I'm honored
to have you as a Rhinette."
80,ANGELO,80,A job's a job.
81,ANNOUNCER (O.S.),81,"Hey, kids! Who's your favorite
rhino?"
82,KIDS,82,Smoochy!
83,SMOOCHY,83,"Hiya, kids!"
84,KIDS,84,"Hi, Smoochy!"
85,SMOOCHY,85,"It's gonna be a fantabulous day in
Smoochyland!!"
86,SMOOCHY,86,"'Ohhhh... it's a fantabulous day
in Smoochy-land/Let's have a great
big cheer for the Smoochy-land
band/We'll dance with our jungle
pals, won't that be grand/Oh, it's
a fantabulous day in Smoochy-
land!'"
87,RANDOLPH,87,"I was starting to think that maybe
you weren't coming."
88,STOKES,88,"I agreed to meet you, didn't I?    I
had a dinner engagement."
89,RANDOLPH,89,"Really? You know, I used to have
dinner engagements. Sometimes
four, five a night. Dinner...
drinks... I was the toast of the
fucking town."
90,STOKES,90,"Don't start, Randolph.   Please."
91,RANDOLPH,91,"Cars, boats, whores and horses, I
had 'em all. When I walked into a
restaurant, ten guys reached for
my hat. When I stood up to take a
piss, they cleared the rest room.
I'd walk down the street and
traffic stopped, mouths gaped.
You know why? You know why,
Frank?"
92,RANDOLPH,92,"I was Rainbow fucking Randolph!
That's why!"
93,STOKES,93,Are you through?
94,RANDOLPH,94,"What? You're in a hurry? You
don't have time for me? The guy
who earned for you? The guy who
put those fucking suits on your
back and the pheasant au vin in
your Brooklyn mouth?"
95,STOKES,95,"I think it's fair to say we helped
each other."
96,RANDOLPH,96,"You gotta fix it, Frank. You
gotta get me my slot back."
97,RANDOLPH,97,"How can I sit around while that
rhinoceros... that horned
carpetbagger gets a free ride on
my dime? You and I have history,
Frank! Please!"
98,STOKES,98,"There's nothing I can do for you.
Nothing. You're a pariah. I
can't even be seen with you."
99,RANDOLPH,99,"Don't do this to me, Frank. I'm in
deep, deep shit. They kicked me out
of the corporate penthouse... I got
bookies breathing down my neck.
I'm homeless! Don't you hear what
I'm saying? I'm not gonna make it!
The clock's ticking! Put yourself
in my shoes, for Christ's sake!"
100,STOKES,100,"The ugly truth is, your shoes have
become my shoes. As long as the
rhino's on the air, everything's
by the book. No skim, no
percentage. Nothing. The network
wanted squeaky clean and they got
it. And believe me, Mopes is
sparkling."
101,STOKES,101,"You're totally broke? You don't
have a dime left to your name?"
102,RANDOLPH,102,"Yes! Exactly! That's what I'm
trying to tell you!"
103,STOKE,103,"Don't contact me again, Randy.
Ever."
104,RANDOLPH,104,"You'll get yours, Frank! The rhino
too! Do you hear me?! The wheels
are turning!"
105,himself),105,"Sooner or later, even a guy who's
squeaky clean falls into mud."
106,NORA,106,"Again, these are just prototypes.
I've been assured by FunZone that
all the bugs will be worked out
before Christmas."
107,NORA,107,"Okay, so let's recap before we
break up..."
108,NORA,108,"Yes to the Smoochy ice pops. No to
the Smoochy string cheese. And
we're in a dick-measuring contest
with Brown & Brown over the
shampoo split."
109,SHELDON,109,"Okay, time out, people! If I may
interject, I think we're putting
the cart before the horse here..."
110,SHELDON,110,"Smoochy's still earning the trust
of the kids. We don't want to
compromise that by asking them to
buy shampoo and cheese. How 'bout we
just concentrate on doing the best
show possible. Huh? Without all
the bells and whistles and
rickata-rackita. What do you say,
guys?"
111,NORA,111,"Oh, damn."
112,SHELDON,112,"No problem, I'll get it."
113,NORA,113,"Shut the door please, John."
114,NORA,114,Now lock it.
115,NORA,115,Thank you.
116,SHELDON,116,"Hey, Nora, wait up."
117,SHELDON,117,"Good meeting today. I thought we
tackled some hot issues.
Although, I'll be honest, there
were a few times that I felt my
voice wasn't being heard."
118,NORA,118,"I think that's a conservative
estimate."
119,SHELDON,119,"I just want the show to have some
weight, you know? Some substance.
Silly songs, sure -- but with a
message. Pop quiz: How many
original compositions are in the
Smoochy songbook?"
120,NORA,120,"Do you sense my complete lack of
interest?"
121,SHELDON,121,"Try two thousand. Covering every
topic from how yummy vegetables
are to the importance of donating
plasma. Don't you get it, Nora?
I'm a valuable resource. Use me."
122,NORA,122,Can I make this real easy for you?
123,SHELDON,123,Sure.
124,NORA,124,"The only reason you're on TV right
now is because Rainbow Randolph is
a degenerate scumbag. I didn't
discover you, I delivered you.
Like a bag of groceries. I have a
bigger emotional investment in my
nail polish. So don't peddle your
sap to me, rhino. Your job is
just to smile and nod your head."
125,SHELDON,125,"... No, no, you misunderstand me.
It's not that I'm literally
comparing Captain Kangaroo to
Jesus Christ. I'm just saying
that the Captain, like Christ, was
someone you could believe in.
Those guys didn't care about bells
and whistles and rickita-rackata.
It was all about the work.
Especially Jesus. Forget about
it."
126,SHELDON,126,"(waving him off)
That's okay, my good man.    Three's
my limit."
127,SHELDON,127,"I never saw anyone get loaded on
orange juice before."
128,SHELDON,128,"Back in my college days I could
put away a carton of the stuff."
129,SHELDON,129,"(to Bartender)
Gimme a Five Crown."
130,BURKE,130,"Smoochy the Rhino.    Wow.   I'm a
big fan."
131,SHELDON,131,"(flattered)
Gee, thanks. I usually don't get
recognized without my horn."
132,BURKE,132,"Burke Bennett.    I represent kid
show talent."
133,BURKE,133,"Look, Shel, Frank Strokes ain't in
the business to make you rich.
He's in it to make Frank Stokes
rich. That's how these network
goons operate."
134,SHELDON,134,"That's so sad. Is it just me, or
is that sad?"
135,BURKE,135,"You know, years ago, a client of
mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a
problem..."
136,SHELDON,136,"Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble?"
137,BURKE,137,"Yeah, before the asshole found
religion. Anyway, Stokes was
trying to screw my boy out of some
merchandising points. Claimed he
had a warehouse full of Dicky
dolls that weren't moving. Now
Frank and I are old friends, so I
say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me
the warehouse' -- see, I know the
fucking warehouse is in the Bronx,
and I know it's emptier than my
wife's head.
(chuckles)
To make a long story short, I walk
out with a check for a hundred
grand and Stokes is sitting there
with his thumb up his ass."
138,SHELDON,138,"That's very amusing, but I don't
care about Smoochy dolls and
Smoochy floor wax... I just want
more creative input. This rhino
came from my womb. I bore him, I
nursed him, and dammit..."
139,SHELDON,139,"I should be the one who raises
him!"
140,BURKE,140,"Shel, it's all about the dough.
After you get the money, you get
the power. And after you get the
power, you can have Smoochy walk
on stage with a hard-on if you
want."
141,SHELDON,141,"It's funny, that never crossed my
mind."
142,BURKE,142,"Unfortunately, until then...
you're just another puppet in the
prop room."
143,BURKE,143,"Give me a call when you're ready,
kid. I'll cut the strings and
open the magic door for you."
144,RANDOLPH,144,"I saw you! I saw you in there...
at my table... talking to him."
145,BURKE,145,"Yeah, so what do you want?    A
parade?"
146,RANDOLPH,146,"You're my agent! Or did you
forget that?"
147,BURKE,147,"Not anymore, pal. You're a
cigarette butt. Go lay in the
gutter."
148,RANDOLPH,148,"Ah! They're beautiful! A perfect
batch of cock cookies for a very
special rhino."
149,RANDOLPH,149,"Oh yes, you're going to learn
about shame, my dear Smoochy.   And
I'm your professor."
150,SHELDON,150,"Excuse me, Nora. Why was the
'Please and Thank You Song' cut?"
151,NORA,151,"Because it's sappy and it takes
away from the 'Cookie Song.'"
152,SHELDON,152,"Takes away? It enhances it! The
cookie song is a meaningless piece
of fluff without the 'Please and
Thank You' coda! That's the moral
anchor! That's where the lesson
is! You can't sell the sizzle
without the steak!"
153,NORA,153,"It's cut. And I want the 'Cookie
Song' lyrics changed back to the
way they were originally scripted."
154,SHELDON,154,"I can't do that. I will not
condone children consuming endless
amounts of refined sugar. I have
to look myself in the mirror every
morning."
155,NORA,155,"This is network television, not a
sprout farm. We're here to sell
sugar and plastic. That's what
keeps the lights on."
156,SHELDON,156,"You're treating me like a puppet.
You know that? Well, guess
what? I am not your puppet."
157,NORA,157,"Since when? Now get your spongy
orange ass out there and dance
for the cameras."
158,SHELDON,158,"We have different eyes, Nora.
When I go out there I see kids.
You see wallets with pigtails."
159,RANDOLPH,159,"Bon soir, la Smoochy.   Welcome to
fatty Arbuckle-land."
160,RANDOLPH,160,"Don't worry, little ones. Rainbow
Randolph will return..."
161,RANDOLPH,161,After these messages!
162,SMOOCHY,162,"Boy, all that jiggyin' and
ziggyin' sure makes a fella
hungry! Now if only I had my
super duper, super secret, super
special..."
163,KIDS,163,Magic Cookie Bag!
164,SMOOCHY,164,Right-o-riffic!
165,SMOOCHY,165,"Magic Cookie Bag, I command thee!
Come to your lord and master!"
166,SMOOCHY,166,"'Lookie, lookie, lookie, here
comes the cookies! Fresh and
organic, no need to panic! Right
from the soil, no tropical oils!
Sweetened with juice, for an
energy boost! Fiber galore,
you'll be askin' for more...'"
167,SMOOCHY,167,"Oooh... just the smell of
unprocessed flour makes my tummy
do somersaults!"
168,RANDOLPH,168,"Whatever that means, you fucking
retard."
169,RANDOLPH,169,"Give 'em a cookie... give 'em a
cookie..."
170,SMOOCHY,170,"Wow! Look at this cookie, kids!
A rocket ship!"
171,SHELDON,171,"What a special day with such
special cookies!"
172,SHELDON,172,"Rrrrrrrr! Look at me, kids! I'm
flying to the moon! I'm flying to
Mars! I'm flying to --"
173,RANDOLPH,173,"Are you fucking blind?! It's a
cock! Not a space ship! Cock!
Cock!"
174,SHELDON,174,"Thank you all for coming. I just
wanted to iron out a few wrinkles
I feel we're having in the
communication department. No
finger-pointing. Lord knows when
you start pointing fingers,
someone gets poked in the eye."
175,SHELDON,175,"Anyhoo, I'd like to turn the floor
over to my new agent, Mr. Burke
Bennett. So... heeeeeere's Burke!"
176,BURKE,176,"As you can imagine, my client has
many concerns, not the least of
which is studio security, but we
can address that later."
177,BURKE,177,"See this guy, Frank? Take a good
long look, 'cause this prick saved
your life. Without him you'd be
sitting in Kaplan's right now,
sucking club soda through a paper
straw."
178,BURKE,178,"And, you -- you'd be organizing
puppet shows for the brats at
P.S. 86. Excuse me, honey."
179,NORA,179,There's no excuse for you.
180,SHELDON,180,"Man, I love club soda."
181,STOKES,181,"We've always managed to come to
some sort of arrangement, Burke.
Why the fireworks?"
182,BURKE,182,"'Cause I'm holding all the
gunpowder. I represent the man
who created, owns, and controls
every square inch of Smoochy the
Rhino."
183,BURKE,183,"God created Adam and what did he
get? A fucking dud. My guy? He
breathed life into a winner. And
anyone who does a better job than
God is gonna have a price."
184,SHELDON,184,"Burke, of course, is in no way
comparing me to God."
185,BURKE,185,Yes I am.
186,NORA,186,"You seem to forget that we went
out and found 'your guy.' Dug up
his corpse. Handed him his own
show when he couldn't sell his
face to a photo booth."
187,SHELDON,187,"To be fair, Nora, I was booked to
open a car wash in Montauk."
188,BURKE,188,"Oh, so you were doing him a favor?"
189,BURKE,189,"Allow me to untangle this web of
shit! I don't care what his
resume was, I don't care where you
found him, I don't care if his
last job was juggling apples for a
hut full of Pygmies on the
outskirts of the Congo... the fact
is, he fits a bill and you need
him. Like a hungry baby needs a
big tit. And that, my friends, is
why you're in a box with no
ventilation. And that is why the
rhino is going to get what
he deserves."
190,STOKES,190,"What is that, exactly?"
191,BURKE,191,"Heaven, hell, and everything in
between."
192,BURKE,192,"To the star and new executive
producer of the Smoochy show! May
your reign be a long and healthy
one!"
193,SHELDON,193,"I'm still in shock. Complete
creative control, part ownership
of the show, discretion over
merchandising and a dressing room
with a toilet! Am I dreaming or
what?"
194,BURKE,194,"And don't forget the corporate
penthouse. It took me six years
to get that for Randolph."
195,SHELDON,195,"Boy, imagine... me, living in a
penthouse. Who'd a thunk it."
196,BURKE,196,"It's called the high life, kid.
Get used to it. Pretty soon
you'll be burnin' one hundred
dollar bills just to see
Franklin break a sweat."
197,SHELDON,197,"Jeez, I hope not. I have a deep
respect for money. Not to mention
Ben Franklin who had some
remarkable achievements in his
lifetime."
198,SHELDON,198,What's this?
199,BURKE,199,"That's your graduation present.
Something you're gonna need now."
200,BURKE,200,"Think of it as a tool of the
trade."
201,SHELDON,201,"I've never owned a gun, I've never
touched a gun, and I don't believe
in guns. When I played cowboys
and Indians as a kid, I was always
the Chinese railroad worker."
202,BURKE,202,"Trust me, Shel. It's a handy
accessory in this business. Even
if you don't load it, have it for
show. Sometimes that's all you
need. Especially with a creep
like Randolph lurking around."
203,SPINNER,203,"Hiya, Smoochy! I'm Spinner!
Spinner!"
204,SHELDON,204,Hi there.
205,SPINNER,205,"I'm so excited to meet you!    I'm
Spinner!"
206,SHELDON,206,"Oh... right. I saw you fight on
TV once. I think it was your
farewell bout."
207,RINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #1,207,"Tonight marks Spinner Dunn's final
appearance in the ring. What a
pleasure it's been to watch him
proudly march into the record books
for taking more blows to the head
than any fighter in history."
208,RINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #2,208,"Scrambled a bit? Sure. You don't
retire with a record of 81-59 and
wind up the Governor. But on the
upside, he's got the disposition
of a collie."
209,SPINNER,209,"You know what I love, Smoochy? I
love when you do the Jiggy Ziggy
dance! You know, the one you do
during 'Silly Time?'"
210,SHELDON,210,You bet.     That's a big one.
211,SPINNER,211,Wanna see me do it?
212,SHELDON,212,"Well, I don't know why if there's
enough room here to..."
213,BURKE,213,"Okay, champ, don't get overheated."
214,SPINNER,214,I love you.
215,SHELDON,215,"I... uh... love you, too, Spinner."
216,TOMMY,216,"Spinner, come over and meet the
Senator!"
217,SHELDON,217,"He seems pretty popular. It must
take real talent to run a place
like this."
218,BURKE,218,"Spinner? The guy couldn't run a
water faucet. He's just a mascot.
It's his cousins, a bunch of Irish
mob boys, who really run the
joint."
219,SPINNER,219,"Don't go anywhere, Smoochy! I'll
be right back after I take a dump!"
220,BURKE,220,"I think you made a new friend,
kid."
221,ANGELO,221,"Yeah, who is it?"
222,ANGELO,222,"(friendly)
Open up, buddy! It's me,
Randolph! It's been a long time!"
223,ANGELO,223,Randy?
224,RANDOLPH,224,"You fucking traitor! My body's
barely cold and already you work
for the rhino?"
225,ANGELO,225,"I don't know what you're talking
about."
226,RANDOLPH,226,"Don't lie to me! I heard all about
it! You strapped that horn on
faster than a cheerleader gets the
clap!"
227,ANGELO,227,"I gotta eat, don't I?"
228,RANDOLPH,228,"You're a Krinkle Kid!   Not a
Smooch-bag! Say it!"
229,ANGELO,229,Rhinette!
230,RANDOLPH,230,"Say it: I am a Krinkle Kid! Say
it, before God! On the soul of
Jesus Christ! Say what you are!"
231,ANGELO,231,"I'm a Rhinette. Got that? The
Krinkle Kids are ten feet under.
With you."
232,RANDOLPH,232,"I missed you so much. Can I stay
here? I got no place to go."
233,RANDOLPH,233,"... They kicked me out of the
corporate penthouse. Big
surprise. Sons-a-bitches. That's
how I got this beauty."
234,RANDOLPH,234,"And of course, there's this..."
235,RANDOLPH,235,"That happened after my little
visit to the studio the other day.
Network security. Fucking savages."
236,RANDOLPH,236,"I got liens, back taxes, lawyer's
bills, threats against my life...
I basically got the whole fucking
world up my ass. It's okay, I got
a loooong memory, son."
237,RANDOLPH,237,"What dey sow, dey gonna reap."
238,ANGELO,238,Stop doing this to yourself!
239,ANGELO,239,"Wise up! You hear me? Don't piss
your life away like this."
240,RANDOLPH,240,"It's the rhino, Angie. He's been
sent by the devil. Sent from hell
to destroy me. Smoochy... is the
face of evil."
241,SHELDON,241,"Whenever you get a chance... I
just need a second."
242,NORA,242,"(into the phone)
Listen, can I call you back?
Yeah, some asshole's screaming in
my ear. Thanks."
243,SHELDON,243,"I'm sorry, you didn't have to hang
up."
244,NORA,244,If I didn't you'd still be here.
245,SHELDON,245,But I am still here.
246,NORA,246,I'm hoping to correct that.
247,SHELDON,247,"Nora, I want us to start off on
the right foot. I want you to
know that I value your input and I
don't want you to feel intimidated
just because the power structure
has changed a bit. I consider you
a partner."
248,NORA,248,"Great. That'll come in handy if
we're ever at a square dance."
249,SHELDON,249,"Well, I was never much of the
do- se-do type, but what I would
love to do is take you out to lunch
one day. You know, just two
colleagues chewing the fat...
forming a mutual respect...
planting the seeds of
cooperation..."
250,NORA,250,No.
251,SHELDON,251,"Fair enough. If you change your
mind --"
252,NORA,252,I won't.
253,SHELDON,253,"Okay then, I'll be in my office if
you need me. If you want to
brainstorm about anything. Ideas
and so forth."
254,SHELDON,254,Ficus?
255,SHELDON,255,Wow...
256,TOMMY (O.S.),256,"My cousin Spinner's take quite a
shine to you."
257,TOMMY,257,"Ever since you came in the
restaurant. He can't stop yakkin'."
258,SHELDON,258,"Well, he's a very nice man. Very
sweet disposition for someone that
size."
259,TOMMY,259,"So, I was wondering if maybe you
could give him a little floor
space."
260,SHELDON,260,I'm sorry?
261,TOMMY,261,"You know, a little part on the
show. You're the executive
producer now. You call the shots,
right?"
262,SHELDON,262,"Uh, that's a very sweet offer, and
I love Spinner, but TV is a
complicated medium and... I mean,
that would be like me getting into
the ring with a prizefighter."
263,SHELDON,263,"Can you imagine such a thing?
Boom. K.O.! What's the alphabet,
Mommy?"
264,TOMMY,264,"This makes me sad.    Very, very,
sad."
265,DANNY,265,"What's wrong, Tommy?"
266,TOMMY,266,"Nothing.     I'm just very sad right
now."
267,SAMMY,267,"Who made you sad, Tommy?"
268,TOMMY,268,I don't want to mention names.
269,SHELDON,269,"You know what? Maybe I can find
Spinner a little something to do
on the show. That's probably the
best solution."
270,TOMMY,270,"You're a good boy, Mopes. Don't
think we don't remember favors."
271,SHELDON,271,"Look, I appreciate the visit, but
I'm just putting together a little
petting zoo segment. Nothing
fancy -- a few kittens... maybe a
duck..."
272,SONNY,272,"If you're looking to bring in that
many pieces I gotta put a crew
together. Plus, we're lookin' at
transpo, a few leash handlers, a
cleanup boy and a doper to keep
the inventory quiet."
273,SHELDON,273,"Jeez, this all sounds awfully
elaborate. I might have to forgo
the union and just borrow a few
animals from a pet shop."
274,SONNY,274,"I wouldn't recommend it. Miss
Carol from Romper Room tried that
once and she's still limping."
275,42.,275,"On behalf of FunZone Toys, I'd
like to congratulate you on your
recent promotion, and present you
with a small gift."
276,SHELDON,276,"Uh... that's nice of you, Ben, but
a card would have been fine."
277,SHELDON,277,"FunZone Toys would very much like
the Smoochy contract, Mr. Mopes."
278,SHELDON,278,"Is this... I mean... are you
offering me a bribe or something?"
279,SHELDON,279,"FunZone Toys would very much like
the Smoochy contract, Mr. Mopes."
280,SHELDON,280,"Normally, sir, we take the trash
out at the end of the day, but I
think I'll make an exception in
your case."
281,SHELDON,281,Yes?
282,SHELDON,282,A Mr. Feedlepepper on line two.
283,SHELDON,283,Who?
284,SHELDON,284,He says he's an old friend.
285,SHELDON,285,Hello?
286,RANDOLPH (V.O.),286,"You better grow eyes on the back
of your fucking head, you horned
piece of shit! I won't sleep
until the worms are crawlin' up
your foam rubber ass! I'm going
on safari, motherfucker... safari!"
287,NORA,287,"Congratulations on your little ice
show."
288,SHELDON,288,What are you talking about?
289,NORA,289,"It didn't take you long to sell out,
did it?"
290,NORA,290,"What happened to your precious
integrity? Or was that just part
of your dog and pony act."
291,SHELDON,291,"Burke, I never agreed to do an ice
show."
292,BURKE,292,"Shel, do you know what kind of
cash we'll take in between the
gate and concessions? A venture
like this gets you money and
muscle. Times twenty."
293,SHELDON,293,"Ice shows represent everything I'm
against. They're mindless
spectacles whose main purpose is
to sell overpriced sugar-water and
cheap plastic toys that splinter
in a kid's mouth on the ride home."
294,BURKE,294,"Look, I know you got this fetish
for ethics, but now's not the time
to fly that kite. No one's ever
refused a shot at an ice show."
295,SHELDON,295,"Until now. Smoochy doesn't sell
out, Burke. You should be proud
of that. Proud that you represent
a client who paves driveways, not
paints them over."
296,BURKE,296,"I'm thrilled, Shel. Knocked out."
297,SHELDON,297,"I'll have a pineapple juice,
Sandy."
298,SANDY,298,"Pineapple? What happened to
orange juice?"
299,SHELDON,299,I'm feeling feisty tonight.
300,SMOOCHY,300,"Boy, wasn't that fun? In an
awkward kind of way? Anyhoo, how
'bout a big round of applause for
the newest member of the
Smoochyland Band... former
heavyweight contender, Spinner
Dunn!"
301,SPINNER,301,Shit.   Sorry.
302,SPINNER,302,"Did I do good, Sheldon, huh?   Did I
do good?"
303,SHELDON,303,"Yeah, that was great, Spinner.
Just watch your elbow next time.
Pinky's probably gonna lose that
tooth."
304,SPINNER,304,"Okey doke.   I'm gonna go get drunk
now."
305,NORA,305,"Nice job. Casting the show with
mental patients, I like that."
306,SHELDON,306,"He is not a mental patient. He's
an ex-boxer and nightclub owner
who happens to have the sweet
innocent brian of a five-year-old!"
307,NORA,307,"Excuse me for not making the
distinction."
308,MERV,308,Hi there.
309,SHELDON,309,Hi.
310,MERV,310,Get in.
311,SHELDON,311,"Thanks anyway, but I'm going
uptown."
312,MERV,312,"Humor me, rhino."
313,MERV,313,"Merv Green, Sheldon. It's a
pleasure to meet you."
314,SHELDON,314,"If you're hoping for an autograph,
the gun's a bit much. The whole
'catch more flies with honey'
thing -- it really holds water."
315,MERV,315,"Sheldon, I represent the Parade of
Hope Foundation. Maybe you've
heard of us."
316,SHELDON,316,"You raise money to build
children's hospitals, right?"
317,MERV,317,"We've been known to add a brick or
two, sure."
318,MERV,318,"Sheldon, let me get right to the
point -- there's talk on the
street that you're pulling out of
the ice show. Is that true?"
319,"SHELDON
(big sigh)",319,"You know, I never agreed to an
ice show, nor would I ever agree
to do an ice show, and let me add
that none of this is your concern,
sir."
320,"SHELDON
(big sigh)",320,Sheesh.
321,MERV,321,"Listen carefully, son: Parade of
Hope has sponsored every Kidnet
ice show since 1964. We take a
piece off the top and everybody
walks away happy. So let's not
buck history."
322,SHELDON,322,"Well, I appreciate the offer, but
for the gazillionth time, I'm not
doing an ice show, so we have
nothing to discuss. Now, if
you'll just pull over, I'll get
out and we'll say our toodley-dos."
323,SHELDON,323,"Far corner, please."
324,MERV,324,"Allow me to be less murky.
Starting tomorrow, Smoochy the
Rhino raises his baton for Parade
of Hope. Benefits, banquets,
fund-raisers, I want it all."
325,MERV,325,"Pull over, Terry."
326,MERV,326,"And as far as the ice show goes...
I recommend you start shopping
for skates."
327,SHELDON,327,"This is unacceptable, Burke!    I'm
calling the authorities."
328,SHELDON,328,"Don't do it, Shel. You rat on
Parade of Hope and you'll be lucky
if they find your toenails. These
guys are the roughest of all the
charities."
329,SHELDON,329,"I was threatened by an
organization that's supposed to
help children! What kind of world
is this?"
330,BURKE (V.O.),330,"The real one. My advice?
Consider the ice show and stay
healthy."
331,NORA,331,May I come in?
332,SHELDON,332,Sure.
333,SHELDON,333,Uh... are you okay?
334,NORA,334,"I'm getting drunk and I'm not used
to it."
335,SHELDON,335,"Oh. Well, not to make you feel
worse, but with alcohol you're
also consuming empty calories."
336,NORA,336,"It's just that... I want to
apologize, actually. And on those
rare occasions when I feel the
need to apologize for something,
it helps if I'm, you know... shit-
faced."
337,SHELDON,337,Wow.   I'm honored.
338,SHELDON,338,Why don't we get some air?
339,NORA,339,"I... I may have been a little
harsh when we spoke the other day.
A little out of line."
340,SHELDON,340,"Well, it wasn't as bad as the week
before when you called me a pasty-
faced, no-talent hack."
341,NORA,341,"Yes, that was probably insensitive
as well."
342,NORA,342,"I heard you're not doing the ice
show. I find that... incredibly
admirable. Why didn't you tell
me?"
343,SHELDON,343,"I guess I didn't want to spoil
your fun. You look so content
when you're berating me."
344,NORA,344,"I'm afraid I have become a bit
hardened over the years.
Sincerity's an easy disguise in
this business. It's hard to know
who's on the level."
345,SHELDON,345,"Believe me, I'm learning that more
and more every day."
346,(wistfully),346,"'Sometimes light is really dark,
Sometimes crows can sing like
larks
Sometimes Winter feels like
Spring,
Don't think you know everything.'"
347,NORA,347,'Rickets the Hippo'?
348,SHELDON,348,You remember Rickets?
349,NORA,349,"That was my favorite show when I
was a kid. Rickets was the one
face I knew I could trust."
350,SHELDON,350,"That's how I felt! Rickets had
real depth. He was my inspiration
for Smoochy."
351,NORA,351,"Really? He was my inspiration to
work in children's television."
352,SHELDON,352,"I can't believe it. I never met
anyone who even remembers Rickets.
Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky
dance?"
353,NORA,353,"Remember it?   I did it at my first
communion."
354,SHELDON,354,"I'm sorry. That was a mistake,
right? I didn't mean for that to
hap--"
355,NORA,355,"You're not full of shit like all
the others, are you?"
356,SHELDON,356,"No, no."
357,NORA,357,"You're for real, right?"
358,SHELDON,358,"Yes, yes."
359,NORA,359,"I mean, I couldn't tell... First I
thought it was an act... and then
I just thought you were a simp or
something..."
360,SHELDON,360,"Shhh... you don't have to
explain..."
361,NORA,361,I should go.
362,SHELDON,362,Why?
363,SHELDON,363,"What's wrong? Is it the whiskey?
If you have to throw up, be my
guest. Anywhere you like."
364,NORA,364,It's just getting late.
365,NORA,365,Better get that.    Good night.
366,SHELDON,366,Hello?
367,RANDOLPH,367,"Hello, Mr. Mopes? My name is
Benjamin Kunklepeck and I'm
calling on behalf of 'Parents for
Decency in Children's Television,'
perhaps you've heard of us?"
368,SHELDON,368,"No, but I like where you're coming
from. It's an issue very close to
my heart. Why just yesterday I
was commenting --"
369,RANDOLPH,369,"Sir, we're having a banquet
tomorrow and we'd be honored to
have you perform for us. We would
also like to present you with a
plaque for your ongoing commitment
to children's television. The
presenter will be a young orphan
with mild asthma. Can you attend?"
370,RANDOLPH,370,"Thanks for picking me up, Mr.
Kunklepeck. It's very nice of
you."
371,RANDOLPH,371,"Don't be silly. The chance to
have Smoochy the Rhino perform at
our little soiree? I'd carry you
piggy-back through a bed of hot
rusty glass if I had to."
372,SHELDON,372,"Well, it's always a pleasure to
help out a worthy cause. And
believe me, I've learned lately
that it's not all sunshine and
daffodils in the land of non-
profit."
373,RANDOLPH,373,"I just looove your show, by the
way. It's such a refreshing
change of pace from that dreadful
embezzler... what's his name
again? Rainbow something or
other?"
374,SHELDON,374,Randolph.
375,RANDOLPH,375,"Yes. Rainbow Randolph. What a
scoundrel! He's probably gay too."
376,SHELDON,376,"Oh, I don't know. I feel sorry
for him, actually. He obviously
has problems or issues that he
needs to sort out."
377,RANDOLPH,377,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't you
take particular glee in that you
basically stole his time slot?
Helped shovel dirt onto his
miserable corpse, as it were?"
378,SHELDON,378,"No, I would never take pleasure in
someone's downfall. You know the
old expression about walking a
mile in another man's shoes?
Well, that really holds water.
Just try to imagine --"
379,RANDOLPH,379,"Come on, he's a fucking asshole!
You hate him! Admit it!"
380,SHELDON,380,Uh... can we listen to the radio?
381,RANDOLPH,381,"Okay, they're ready for you!"
382,SHELDON,382,"I gotta say, this is a first -- I
never performed in a tractor parts
warehouse before."
383,RANDOLPH,383,"Well, we like to do these things
no-frills. It's all about the
kids."
384,SHELDON,384,Amen to that.

I don't hate anyone!"

be a hundred!"

404,SHELDON,404,I have to talk to you.
405,NORA,405,We have nothing to talk about.
406,SHELDON,406,"Don't tell me you believe what
they're saying!"
407,NORA,407,"I don't have to believe anyone.
The picture in the paper said it
all. No one forced you to perform
at that rally."
408,SHELDON,408,Perform?     I barely sang one song.
409,NORA,409,"Well maybe next time you'll do
a longer set."
410,SHELDON,410,"Nora, I had no idea that was a
Nazi function. None whatsoever!"
411,NORA,411,"Funny, you'd think the fifty-foot
swastika you were standing in
front of might've given you a
hint."
412,SHELDON,412,"The papers are blowing that out of
proportion. It was nowhere near
that big."
413,NORA,413,"Look, the fact of the matter is, I
don't know you, okay? Not really.
So don't expect me to go out on an
emotional limb here."
414,SHELDON,414,"But what about the balcony? What
about the Klunky-Wunky dance?"
415,NORA,415,"I was drunk.    Don't read too much
into it."

Record albums, toys, cereal, tee
shirts, you name it..."
421,CHICK (V.O.),421,"Look, Stokes, let's cut the
bullshit. We want Takashi in
that Smoochy slot and we're willing
to do whatever it takes to get it."
422,STOKES,422,"Pardon me for saying this, but for
a non-resident of this country,
you speak impeccable English."
423,STOKES,423,I'm originally from Teaneck.
424,STOKES,424,Ah.
425,STOKES,425,"We own every hair on this bastard's
head and we're willing to share a
few strands... if you get my drift."
426,STOKES,426,"Well, it's not that simple. I
have an executive board to answer
to. I wish I could just snap my
fingers and make a deal but --"
427,CHICK,427,You mean like this?
428,STOKES,428,"Oh my.   And what is this on my
desk?"
429,CHICK,429,"Two hundred grand in a Louis
Vuitton duffle bag. Get our boy
the slot and we'll round it off to
a million. And you can keep the
luggage."
430,CHICK,430,"You're dealing with an honorable
culture, Frank. We know how to
play ball."
431,STOKES,431,"Gentlemen, I suddenly feel
invigorated and full of hope."
432,RANDOLPH,432,"Hiya, cutie!"
433,RANDOLPH,433,"So here's the good news: Yes,
I'll be happy to end my sabbatical
and return to my old slot. I know
you and Frank are in a bind, so
I'll start Monday. Call wardrobe,
call props, tell 'em the R man is
back and he's ready to start
whistlin' dem happy tunes for da
little chillens."
434,RANDOLPH,434,"Ahhh. Who do ya gotta blow to get
a Scotch around here?"
435,NORA,435,"You've got three seconds to pry
your ass off my couch and get out."
436,RANDOLPH,436,"Dammit, Nora! The rhino's gone!
You need that slot filled and
I'm ready to reclaim what's
rightfully mine."
437,NORA,437,"Just in case you forgot, you're a
criminal and a scumbag."
438,RANDOLPH,438,"Okay, so maybe I commandeered a
stray shekel or two. Big deal!
Compared to what Smoochy did
that's like jerking off in the
supermarket."
439,NORA,439,Where do you shop?
440,RANDOLPH,440,"Come on. Have you lost all
affection for me? After what we
once had?"
441,NORA,441,"That was a long time ago.    I was
young and stupid."
442,RANDOLPH,442,Why we broke up I'll never know.
443,NORA,443,"You turned into an asshole and I
didn't love you."
444,RANDOLPH,444,"We could've worked through all
that."
445,RANDOLPH,445,"Damn it, Nora! The public is
clamoring for me! I'm a fucking
patriot! Mopes is a Nazi! He's
evil! He's probably even gay!
You should've seen the way he was
checking me out in the car!"
446,NORA,446,What does that mean?
447,RANDOLPH,447,What does what mean?
448,NORA,448,"You said he was checking you out
in the car. What car?"
449,RANDOLPH,449,"No... it's just a vibe! A Nazi
homosexual vibe! It emanates from
the television! The whole Smoochy
costume... with the erect horn...
I mean, what's that all about?"
450,NORA,450,"You're talking awfully fast,
Randolph."
451,RANDOLPH,451,"I still love you!   Let's go on a
date!"
452,NORA,452,"Were you at that rally? Tell me!
Did you have something to do with
this?"
453,NORA,453,Did you set Sheldon up?
454,RANDOLPH,454,"You know, now I remember why we
broke up. Always with the
accusations. Bitch, bitch,
bitch..."
455,TOMMY,455,"What's wrong, kid? The mayor of
Patterson's here with his wife.
They wanna meet ya."
456,SPINNER,456,"I don't wanna meet no one. I miss
Smoochy! He never woulda done the
things they say he done. He ain't
no Nazi. Someone's making stuff
up. I just know it, Tommy.
Someone's making stuff up!"
457,SPINNER,457,"I want Smoochy back! I want to be
on TV again! I want to play my
cowbell!"
458,NORA,458,"Hi, Tommy. Hi, Spinner.   Has
Burke been in tonight?"
459,TOMMY,459,Haven't seen him.
460,NORA,460,Damn it.
461,TOMMY,461,Something I can help you with?
462,NORA,462,"I have to talk to him.    It's about
Sheldon."
463,SPINNER,463,Sheldon?     What about Sheldon?
464,RANDOLPH,464,"I'm trying to sleep, asshole!
Read the fucking meter some other
time!"
465,TOMMY,465,You wanna tell me about the rhino?
466,RANDOLPH,466,"Hey, this is private property,
creep! And you're trespassing!"
467,TOMMY,467,"Danny, go give Mr. Smiley a little
back rub."
468,REPORTER #1,468,"How does it feel to be voted the
most hated man in America,
Randolph?"
469,RANDOLPH,469,"In a country like this, where your
average citizen is a fuckin'
Neanderthal, I wear it as a badge of
honor."
470,REPORTER #2,470,"What about Ms. Bishop's charge that
you have an unhealthy obsession
with Sheldon Mopes?"
471,RANDOLPH,471,"Listen, I barely know that broad.
She's a wacko. An opportunist.
I'm the most accused man since
Jimmy Hoffa."
472,RANDOLPH,472,"That was unfair! Who threw that?
That was mean and uncalled for!"
473,LAWYER,473,"My client is not answering any
more questions. Between his
dwindling cash flow and mounting
legal bills he's sinking into a
deep psychotic depression. Please
stop antagonizing him. Thank you."
474,SHELDON,474,"I wouldn't be back here if it wasn't
for you."
475,NORA,475,"I'm just sorry I didn't believe
you... that I got swept up in the
frenzy of anti-Smoochyism."
476,SHELDON,476,"Well, this town's a house of mirrors
sometimes. It's hard to know what
you're looking at."
477,STAGEHAND,477,"They're ready for you, Sheldon."
478,ANNOUNCER (V.O.),478,"Ladies and gentlemen... boys and
girls..."
479,ANNOUNCER (V.O.),479,Who's your favorite rhino?
480,KIDS IN BLEACHERS,480,Smoochy!!!
481,SMOOCHY,481,"Thank you. It's good to be back.
You know, kids, sometimes life in
the jungle can be unfair. A place
where nice guys don't just finish
last... they get their heads cut
off."
482,SMOOCHY,482,"That pretty world you think you
know is just props and scenery.
Lollipop trees with roots in
venom!"
483,SMOOCHY,483,"So look around you, boys and
girls. Every day. Be diligent!
Stand strong! As the old proverb
says: Beat a dog one time too
many and you get a wolf! Let's
start howling! Howl for me, boys
and girls!"
484,SMOOCHY,484,"Okay, I just wanted to get that
off my chest. Who wants to do the
Hokey-Pokey?!"
485,TARA (V.O.),485,"Well, Smoochy's back and boy did
we miss him. Hundreds of well-
wishers stood outside Kidnet
Studios today hoping to catch a
glimpse of their favorite rhino."
486,HUNTER (V.O.),486,"That's right, Tara. Smoochy's
popularity is stronger than ever
thanks to his recent exoneration
as a Nazi sympathizer. In fact,
several movie studios are offering
big bucks for a chance to bring
the Smoochy story to the silver
screen..."
487,RANDOLPH,487,"Bad... very bad... too much for
brain... pressure building... ears
ringing... eyes burning...
contempt overflowing..."
488,RANDOLPH,488,"I hate you! I fucking hate you!!!
You devil-horned mind fucker!
Die, die, die!!"
489,ANGELO,489,"What are you doing?! That's a
Zenith!"
490,ANGELO,490,Look at this place!
491,ANGELO,491,"That's it! I want you out of
here!"
492,RANDOLPH,492,Where am I supposed to go?
493,ANGELO,493,I don't care!
494,ANGELO,494,Out!!
495,SHELDON,495,"Easy, Spinner. Watch the ribs,
buddy."
496,SPINNER,496,I missed you so much!
497,SHELDON,497,"I missed you too, champ."
498,SPINNER,498,"I've been practicing and
practicing and I got real good,
Sheldon. Real good!"
499,SPINNER,499,Wanna see me march?
500,SHELDON,500,"Sure, why not."
501,BURKE,501,"So you were saying you had some
good news?"
502,SHELDON,502,"Yes. Some very good news. After
giving it a lot of thought... I've
decided to do the ice show."
503,BURKE,503,"Finally! I got me a bar mitzvah
boy. Today you are a man!"
504,SHELDON,504,"I realize now it's a sin to waste
your power."
505,BURKE,505,"Like they say, rock bottom's a
college education."
506,SHELDON,506,"But here's the really good news:
I'm doing it myself. No sponsors,
no vendors, no crooks. Not one
dirty hand will touch this. Not
one person will make a dollar off
these kids. Smoochy on Ice will
be a study in purity."
507,SHELDON,507,"As far as food concessions go,
I'll supply the refreshments. For
free. Low sodium, whole wheat
pretzels and apple slices. Healthy
stuff. Now are you ready for the
best part?"
508,BURKE,508,I'm holding my breath.
509,SHELDON,509,"All profits from ticket sales will
be used to built a state-of-the-
art methadone clinic in Coney
Island."
510,SHELDON,510,"I'm not just talking a run-of-the-
mill clinic... I'm going to build
a methadone palace. A place where
men and women can withdraw in
luxury."
511,BURKE,511,"Sheldon, you can't do an ice show
and cut out the vendors. And more
importantly, you can't cut out the
Parade of Hope. It's suicide."
512,SHELDON,512,"You always told me, when you've
got muscles you make the rules.
Well, I'm feeling pretty strong
right now."
513,SHELDON,513,"All this time I was letting the
business use me. Well, I think it's
time I start using the business.
I've got my clout back and I'm not
gonna waste it this time. Take care
of it, Burke."
514,TOMMY,514,"Shel, you gotta help me out. He
bangs that goddamn thing from
morning till night. I got a
headache that goes from my eyes to
my ass."
515,SHELDON,515,"Whatever I can do, Tommy, just say
it. You know I love Spinner. And
I owe you."
516,TOMMY,516,"Give the boy something else to do on
the show. Anything. Just as long
as it don't clang, chime or honk."
517,CHICK,517,"I don't like complications, Frank.
You got one week to get Takashi that
slot or you're gonna be shakin'
hands with Buddha."
518,STOKES,518,"Don't you understand? My hands are
tied. The rhino's been exonerated.
The show's more popular than ever."
519,CHICK,519,"Okay, boys, chop him up, bag him
and dump him in the woods."
520,STOKES,520,"All right! I'll take care of it!
I just need time!"
521,CHICK,521,"One week, Jeeves. Got that? Or
I get a blender and make an Orange
Julius with your feet."
522,MAN,522,"Save the rhino! Before it's too
late! Make a donation! Save the
rhino!"
523,MAN,523,"Hey, mister, ya wanna help save
the rhino?"
524,RANDOLPH,524,"I'm the one who needs to be saved!
Me. I'm broke! I lost my lawyer!
My only friend kicked me out! I'm
a fucking peanut shell in the
shape of a man! Save the
Rainbow! Save the Rainbow!
Save the Rainbow!"
525,MAN,525,Help!   Someone call a cop!
526,STOKES,526,"Your client is suffocating me. To
make matters worse, he's caused me
to veer into a hazardous situation.
A situation that otherwise could
have a very happy ending."
527,BURKE,527,Tell me more about the Asians.
528,STOKES,528,"They're ruthless. Unwavering.
Unprincipled. And best of all,
they know how the game is played.
They respect our delicate
ecosystem of mutual benefit."
529,STOKES,529,"I'd bring you in on this, Burke.
You'd be my partner on the Takashi
deal. Split down the middle. We
have an opportunity to get back on
track here. Back to the way it
was."
530,BURKE,530,The good old days.
531,STOKES,531,Pre-rhinoceros.
532,BURKE,532,"This is very sticky ground we're
about to walk on."
533,STOKES,533,"Well, you're used to a little
glue on your shoes."
534,BURKE,534,"Let me poke around. Sift through
the possibilities."
535,MERV,535,"This is what happens to guys who
keep secrets, Johnny."
536,MERV,536,"I'll give you the rest next week!
I promise!"
537,MERV,537,"It's not me you're fucking over,
it's sick kids. You got something
against sick kids, Johnny?"
538,JOHNNY,538,No!   I love sick kids!
539,MERV,539,"And you tell that fat producer of
yours, if he ever gives me a low
head count again, he'll lose the
other thumb."
540,BURKE,540,"Merv Green. How's tricks, kid?"
541,MERV,541,"Well, if it ain't smilin' Burke.
Whose bones are you pickin' today?"
542,BURKE,542,"(chuckles)
You got a minute, pally?"
543,MERV,543,"No one freezes me out of an ice
show. No one. I don't care how
many fucking clinics he's trying
to save."
544,BURKE,544,"Look, I'm chokin' on the same bone
as you."
545,MERV,545,"If you're trying to aggravate me,
you're doing a hell of a job."
546,BURKE,546,"I'm not here to aggravate, just
educate. I think Mopes might be
talking to people he shouldn't be
talking to."
547,MERV,547,That's an ugly string of words.
548,BURKE,548,"He's got it in his head that he's
gonna clean up the way we do
business.
(beat)
Truthfully? I wouldn't be
surprised if he's wearing a wire."
549,BURKE,549,"Jesus, I got a thing across town."
550,BURKE,550,"Let's keep talking, Merv. There's
oughta be some kind of solution.
Don't you think?"
551,RANDOLPH,551,"Attention, New Yorkers! You are
about to hear a shocking story
of injustice!"
552,RANDOLPH,552,"I urge you to listen! It has a
surprise ending you won't want
to miss!"
553,RANDOLPH,553,"It's the story of a venomous rhino
and his aggressive campaign to
slander, vilify, defame, denigrate
and villainize my good name! But
one thing he can't do, is take my
life from me. No, friends, only I
have the power to do that!"
554,RANDOLPH,554,"This is what Smoochy has done to
me! He's brought me to this! I
can no longer live in a world
where the innocent suffer and
the wicked thrive!"
555,RANDOLPH,555,Where is God??!!
556,RANDOLPH,556,"I'm sorry to do this, people.
Don't try to talk me out of it."
557,MAN IN CROWD,557,Do it!   Light it!
558,RANDOLPH,558,"Our guest of honor will be here
any moment! This is for his eyes!
For his conscience. He'll have to
live with this imagine for the
rest of his miserable life!"
559,SMOOCHY,559,"Take it from me, Lester. Use your
power. Don't squander it -- build
with it."
560,LESTER,560,"Sound advice, Mr. Mopes. If I
ever get any power I'll give that
a whirl."
561,LESTER,561,"Hey, what's going on up there?"
562,SMOOCHY,562,"Looks like a street performer of
some sort."
563,RANDOLPH,563,"This is it, folks! It's showtime!
I'm sorry to do this, but he's
left me no choice!"
564,RANDOLPH,564,"Shut up, you hillbilly assholes!
You're borough trash! Go back to
your huts across the river!"
565,RANDOLPH,565,"Fuck you! Fuck all you people! I
was the last of the Mohicans!
You'll never see another Rainbow
Randolph in this lifetime! You
had me and you blew it! All of
you!"
566,RANDOLPH,566,"This if for you, Smoochy!
Remember this! As long as you
live, remember this image! You
did this to me!"
567,LITTLE GIRL,567,"Whatcha doin', Rainbow Randolph?"
568,CROWD,568,Smoochy!!!
569,RANDOLPH,569,What does it all mean??!!
570,SPINNER,570,"What do you mean I can't play the
cowbell no more?"
571,SHELDON,571,"You're too talented for the
cowbell, Spinner. Cowbells are
for babies."
572,SPINNER,572,I ain't no baby!
573,SHELDON,573,"That's right. You're a fully
grown man. With whiskers... and
scars... the whole sha-bang.
That's why you deserve a bigger
role on the show. A more
important role..."
574,KIDS,574,"'Stepdads are people too/ They
have bad days, like we all do/
Be patient and help them through/
Stepdads are people too...'"
575,SMOOCHY,575,"(singing)
... 'So three cheers for the man
that I proudly call Stan... He's
not quite a dad or a brother...
Yes, he gets cross, but still he's
the boss... And besides he takes
care of my mother!'"
576,SMOOCHY,576,"Remember, kids. First
impressions, good or bad, are not
always what they seem. Just like
a new puppy, new dads need to
adjust to their surroundings. So
give 'em time! But always
remember... if he becomes abusive
to you or Mommy... what are the
magic numbers?"
577,KIDS IN BLEACHERS,577,"(shouting in unison)
Nine-One-One!"
578,SMOOCHY,578,Right-o-riffic!
579,SMOOCHY,579,"And now, boys and girls, I have a
special surprise. I'd like to
introduce the newest member of the
Magic Jungle... my cousin...
Moochy the Rhino!"
580,SMOOCHY,580,"Howdy, Moochy! Welcome to the
Jungle! You wanna say howdy to
the kids?"
581,SMOOCHY,581,Moochy?
582,SPINNER,582,My name is Moochy.
583,SMOOCHY,583,"That's right. We've established
that."
584,SPINNER,584,"Sheldon, this costume's makin' my
nuts itch."
585,SPINNER,585,"That was fun! Was it bad when I
done that thing, where I tripped
and knocked over the Flamingo and
then he knocked over the cameraman
and then those lights fell down on
that lady's head?"
586,SHELDON,586,"It's fine, Spinner. We'll edit it
out. But tomorrow in rehearsal
we're gonna work on a new thing
called 'the importance of hitting
your mark.'"
587,SPINNER,587,Great!    I get to hit something!
588,NORA,588,Hi.
589,SHELDON,589,Hi.
590,NORA,590,I read about the ice show.
591,SHELDON,591,"Yeah, the papers seem to be really
covering it."
592,NORA,592,"I think it's great. What you're
doing for that clinic."
593,SHELDON,593,Thanks.
594,NORA,594,I just need some clarification...
595,SHELDON,595,"Don't worry. Spinner just needs
a little more rehearsal. I'll get
him there."
596,NORA,596,No I mean about us.
597,NORA,597,"Ever since you've been back I just
feel like there's something that's
not connecting."
598,SHELDON,598,"I guess I'm still readjusting a
little. Like a guy who's come
back from the war. Not that I'd
equate my misfortune with the
brave men and women who protect
us overseas."
599,NORA,599,"I just thought we were on our way
to something... granted, my
mistaken belief that you had ties
to Neo-Nazis might have put a
damper on our relationship, but
I'm sorry for --"
600,VOICE (O.S.),600,Hey -- rhino.
601,ANCHOR (V.O.),601,"Former heavyweight contender and
restaurateur Lawrence 'Spinner'
Dunn was found shot to death in a
rhinoceros outfit early this
morning in Chinatown. Dunn, a
frequent performer on 'Smoochy's
Magic Jungle,' was pronounced dead
at the scene. Police are
searching for --"
602,MERV,602,"How could you hit the wrong
rhino?!"
603,HENRY,603,"Who knew Smoochy had a cousin
Moochy? They look fucking
identical."
604,MERV,604,"Smoochy is bright orange, Moochy
is burnt rust! Read the papers!
Do I gotta take you back to
fucking kindergarten?"
605,MITCH,605,"All you said was 'hit the rhino.'
You never specified the color.
I'm not taking the blame for this
one."
606,MERV,606,"I'm not through with you yet,
rhino! Your time will fucking
come!"
607,McCALL,607,"Ellie, over here."
608,SHELDON,608,"It's my fault. He'd still be
alive if it wasn't for me. He
would have been so proud to be in
the ice show."
609,NORA,609,"There was nothing you could have
done. Don't torture yourself."
610,SHELDON,610,"I'm sorry, Spinner.   I'm so sorry."
611,TOMMY,611,"He really loved you, Shel. And
this I guarantee -- that fucking
Randolph has seen his last
rainbow. We're gonna find him,
cut off his balls, and shove 'em
up his ass."
612,SHELDON,612,"Maybe you better leave it to the
police."
613,DANNY,613,"They won't do the ball thing.
It's against procedure."
614,TOMMY,614,"Don't forget -- that hit was meant
for you, Shel. So from now on,
everywhere you go, we go."
615,SHELDON,615,"That's okay, Tommy.   I'll be fine."
616,TOMMY,616,"Fine, nothin'. And as Christ is
my witness, no one's touchin' a
hair on your fuckin' head.
Spinner would have wanted it that
way."
617,TOMMY,617,"Alright, boys, let's get shit-
faced. For Spin."
618,SHELDON,618,"Didn't Rickets the Hippo have a
song about death?"
619,NORA,619,"'The Last Nappy Time.' It gave me
a lot of comfort when my mother
died."
620,NORA,620,"'When doggies stop barking
And fish cease to swim
And Grandpa lays silent, from his
head to his limbs
Sadness will find you
But soon you'll feel fine...'"
621,SHELDON/NORA,621,"'In life we all have
Our Last Nappy Time.'"
622,RANDOLPH,622,"I didn't do it! I know you're
still mad at me, but you gotta
believe me."
623,ANGELO (V.O.),623,"The papers say you were the
mastermind."
624,RANDOLPH,624,"Mastermind? I can barely figure
out how to unzip my pants these
days. Just taking a piss is a
logistical nightmare."
625,ANGELO (V.O.),625,"I believe you, Randy. But you
can't come back to my place.
They'll find you. You gotta go
underground."
626,ANGELO,626,"It's heatin' up out there. Every
cop in New York is looking for
you. And Tommy Cotter's boys are
combin' the streets. You're gonna
have to stay put for a while."
627,RANDOLPH,627,"I was an altar boy once. Did you
know that? I wanted to be a
priest. Do you believe in angels,
Angie?"
628,ANGELO,628,Angels?
629,RANDOLPH,629,"There was a little angel in
pigtails. She was the only one
who cared about me. She saved my
life."
630,ANGELO,630,"You didn't want to kill yourself,
Randy. You know that."
631,RANDOLPH,631,"Perhaps it's time to heal. To
accept the fact that Smoochy has
won and gracefully march forward.
True, I'm currently wanted for a
murder I didn't commit. But I
have faith. Faith that justice
will prevail."
632,ANGELO,632,"Now you're talkin', kid. This is
a big step... I'm proud of you."
633,RANDOLPH,633,Did you bring lunch?
634,ANGELO,634,Yes.
635,RANDOLPH,635,Chicken and stars?
636,ANGELO,636,Just like you asked for.
637,RANDOLPH,637,"Can I have some, please?"
638,ANGELO,638,For a smile.
639,ANGELO,639,Atta boy.
640,ANGELO,640,"Here, I got you some crossword
puzzles and stuff to read."
641,ANGELO,641,You okay? Randy?
642,RANDOLPH,642,Motherfucker!!!!!!!
643,TOMMY,643,"Big news, Shel."
644,SHELDON,644,What's that?
645,TOMMY,645,"It wasn't Smiley who killed
Spinner. It was Parade of Hope."
646,NORA,646,Merv Green?
647,SHELDON,647,"Are you sure? The cops have tons
of evidence on Randolph."
648,TOMMY,648,"We did our own investigation.
Cousin Ian from down at the
morgue... you met him at the
wake..."
649,IAN,649,"See the neck? Snapped like a
twig. Animals... Parade of Hope's
calling card. When they do a guy,
they like to sign the tab."
650,TOMMY,650,"What's that guy's name over there?
Green?"
651,LEON,651,"Yeah, Merv Green."
652,TOMMY,652,"This was one time they shoulda
left the tab blank."
653,NORA,653,"I knew Merv Green was a scumbag
from the day he grabbed my ass at
a 'Feed the Children' benefit."
654,SHELDON,654,"Well, God help those guys now.
They're gonna get a first-class
ride through the criminal justice
system, and I'm buying the
tickets."
655,TOMMY,655,"It's all taken care of, Shel."
656,SHELDON,656,What does that mean?
657,MERV,657,"It was a mistake! An honest
mistake! All I'm trying to do is
help children."
658,TOMMY,658,"You like kids, huh?"
659,MERV,659,Yes!   Of course!
660,TOMMY,660,"So you must know a few fairy
tales. Danny, tell him the one
about the worthless prick who gets
his head chopped off."
661,TOMMY,661,No... no... no!
662,TOMMY,662,"Now you know why charities go
under sometimes."
663,SHELDON,663,"Do we really need to hear this?
I don't want to hear this."
664,JIMMY,664,A clean cut.
665,SHELDON,665,"Okay, got it."
666,ROY,666,And then we took his head and --
667,SHELDON,667,"Thank you! Specifics about his
head are superfluous at this
point."
668,VOICE (O.S.),668,Where is he?
669,NORA,669,Can I help you with something?
670,CHICK,670,"Yeah, honey, you can help us
with something..."
671,CHICK,671,"You tell that boss of yours he
better take care of the rhino
problem. In my culture we honor
deals or invite consequences."
672,NORA,672,"I don't know what you're talking
about and your cologne's making
me nauseous. Other than that,
you're great company."
673,CHICK,673,"Spicy little thing, isn't she?"
674,CHICK,674,"Takashi gets that time slot. You
hear me, girly? Tell that boss of
yours we'll kill everyone at this
fucking network if we have to.
Starting with the pretty ones."
675,CHICK,675,"Auf Wiedersehen, honey."
676,NORA,676,"It's Stokes. He's behind the
whole thing! He cut some kind of
deal for the Smoochy slot!"
677,SHELDON,677,What are you talking about?
678,NORA,678,"He wants you out so he can put
Takashi in!"
679,SHELDON,679,Who's Takashi?
680,NORA,680,"Jesus, Sheldon! Don't you ever
pick up a copy of International
Performer? He's the hottest kid
show host from Asia."
681,RANDOLPH,681,"Ah! How very cozy. Like two logs
in a little bonfire. All we need
is a few sticks and some wienies."
682,RANDOLPH,682,"I had her before you! Pachyderm!
I was in love with her! In love!
And you snatched her away! Like
a common thief! You're the bad
guy! Not me! He's the bad guy,
Nora. He's incapable of
understanding the love we once
had! Tender, yet passionate.
Old-fashioned, yet experimental."
683,RANDOLPH,683,"Tell him about a few of our
experiments, Nora! Tell him!"
684,SHELDON,684,"Is this true? Please tell me it's
just the confused ramblings of a
diseased mind."
685,SHELDON,685,"Holy mother of Toledo. When
exactly were you planning to let
me know about this?!"
686,NORA,686,"Listen, there was a time -- and
I'm not proud of this -- but there
was a time when I was a bit of
a... kiddie-host groupie."
687,RANDOLPH,687,"You're just another action figure
for her collection!"
688,NORA,688,That's not fair!
689,RANDOLPH,689,Tell him about Jingle Jackson!
690,SHELDON,690,You dated Jingle Jackson?
691,RANDOLPH,691,"The bells turned her on. Hey,
tell him about Jumbo Johnny!
There's a tale for ya! A whale
of a tale!"
692,SHELDON,692,Oh good Lord in Heaven.
693,NORA,693,"Look, what I did before I met you
is none of your business."
694,RANDOLPH,694,"Shut up!   Both of you! This is
my show!"
695,RANDOLPH,695,"Do you fully understand the power
of a condemned man? Do you? I'm
already wanted for one murder, why
should I give a flaming horse's
twat if I commit two more?"
696,SHELDON,696,"I... uh... read once that the best
way to diffuse a tense situation
is with a little humor. To that
end, would you like to hear a
funny joke?"
697,"RANDOLPH
(rolling his eyes)",697,"Oh, please. Go blow yourself,
Martha."
698,(waves gun again),698,"Fix me a beverage, woman. Make me
one of those drinks that used to
make us all warm and fuzzy before
bouncy-bouncy time!"
699,NORA,699,"Fix it yourself, asshole."
700,RANDOLPH,700,"Remember, I have Mr. Boomy."
701,SHELDON,701,"I'm telling you, you'd love this
joke. It revolves around Santa
Claus and the Easter Bunny getting
into a fender bender."
702,RANDOLPH,702,"You know, when I lived here I used
to have a big painting above the
fireplace. A naked chick holding
a pumpkin. It was very tasteful.
No bush..."
703,NORA,703,"Look, Randolph. We know it
wasn't you who killed Spinner."
704,SHELDON,704,"We'll go to the police, first
thing tomorrow... straighten
everything out."
705,RANDOLPH,705,Oh!  Goody-goody gumdrops!
706,RANDOLPH,706,"Vodka straight up is fine, sugar
babe!"
707,RANDOLPH,707,"Did you put on a little weight,
honey? That's okay, you're still
a hot little brood mare. I bet
you miss the sweet sting of my
riding crop. Giddy up, pony!"
708,RANDOLPH,708,"'Rainbow Randolph is the man.
Yes he, yes he, is.
He's the Prez of Rainbowland.
Yes he, yes he, is.
With some fun, fun here, and a
laugh, laugh there.
Here a dance, there a song,
Everything is fun, fun.
Rainbow Randolph is the King, the
King of Rainbowland!'"
709,SHELDON,709,"Is this what you want? A Hansel
and Gretel ending?! You want to
be the big bad wolf?"
710,RANDOLPH,710,"Stop! It's too hot!    The heat!
It's driving me mad!"
711,RANDOLPH,711,"Go ahead, kill me! Finish me off.
My life's over anyway. Everything
I touch turns to shit. Put me out
of my misery."
712,SHELDON,712,"You're not nothing. You're
bitter, misguided and I'm guessing
a raging alcoholic, but you're
still Rainbow Randolph. Despite
everything that's happened, you
once made children happy."
713,RANDOLPH,713,Would you be my friend?
714,SHELDON,714,Sure.
715,RANDOLPH,715,You too?
716,NORA,716,I guess.
717,RANDOLPH,717,Sorry about the brood mare stuff.
718,RANDOLPH,718,Thank you.
719,NORA,719,What are you doing?
720,SHELDON,720,"Just making the playing field
even. I'm tired of running this
race with one leg."
721,NORA,721,"You're letting them drag you down
to their level."
722,RANDOLPH,722,"She's right, Sheldon. Don't make
the same mistakes I did. Keep
your dignity intact."
723,RANDOLPH,723,Son-of-a-bitch!
724,SHELDON,724,"I appreciate everyone's concern,
but I can take care of myself."
725,RANDOLPH,725,I tried.
726,SHELDON,726,"Okay, buddy, we have to get down
to the Garden. You're welcome to
stay here as long as you like.
Just don't leave until I get
things squared away."
727,RANDOLPH,727,"Be careful, Sheldon. Remember
what I told you -- you've only
scratched the surface of this
scummy business. You have yet to
strike oil."
728,RANDOLPH,728,"You're lucky to have a guy like
Smoochy."
729,NORA,729,"You just rest, Randolph."
730,RANDOLPH,730,"He's the real thing. Smoochy's the
real thing. And I've been a fraud.
A wicked man doing wicked acts."
731,SHELDON,731,"Well, we all have our bad days."
732,STOKES,732,"Things are getting out of hand.
We have to cover our tracks."
733,BURKE,733,"Relax, everything's gonna work
out."
734,STOKES,734,"Relax? They found Merv Green's
head on the Grand Concourse!
Excuse my concern."
735,BURKE,735,"Look, we can cover all the tracks
we want, but in the end we still
got the same problem. We gotta
finish what we started."
736,STOKES,736,God help us...
737,BURKE,737,"It'll all be over tonight.
Buggy's gonna take care of
everything."
738,STOKES,738,"Buggy? Buggy Ding-Dong? The guy
who hosted 'Buggy's Bumpy
Railroad'?"
739,STOKES,739,"Yeah, until he discovered the joys
of Turkish black mule heroin. For
the right price he'll do anything.
It's amazing the guy's still alive."
740,STOKES,740,"I don't know, Burke... this whole
thing..."
741,BURKE,741,"Speak of the devil. Have a seat,
Bug."
742,sound cheerful),742,Buggy. You're looking good.
743,BURKE,743,"It's time we put this thing to
rest, Frank. And the way I see
it... the rhino's up past his
bedtime."
744,RANDOLPH,744,"(sing-songy)
Hellooo!"
745,ANGELO,745,"Randy, is that you?"
746,RANDOLPH,746,"Yes, Angelo, my little Twinkie,
shouldn't you be getting ready for
the big show?"
747,ANGELO,747,"Listen, Buggy's been here."
748,RANDOLPH,748,Buggy Double D's?   The Dong Man?
749,ANGELO,749,"Yeah, he lifted my backstage pass
and he's braggin' that he's
doing some kind of job for Burke
Bennett."
750,RANDOLPH,750,"Sheldon's in trouble.   I gotta get
down to the Garden."
751,ANGELO,751,"The place is crawling with cops.
They'll jump on you like a
trampoline."
752,RANDOLPH,752,I don't care.
753,RANDOLPH,753,I have to warn the rhino.
754,ANNOUNCER (V.O.),754,(dramatic pause)
755,SHELDON,755,This is for Spinner.
756,MAN,756,"It's Rainbow Randolph!   Someone
stop him!"
757,RANDOLPH,757,Sheldon!!!
758,STOKES,758,"What's he doing here?! He's going
to screw everything up!"
759,NORA,759,Sheldon!!!
760,BURKE,760,Nora...
761,NORA,761,"You're in on this, aren't you!
You sold him out! You fucking
snake!"
762,STOKES,762,"Nora, please. It's not what you
think. I'm grooming you. You're
going to run the division one
day..."
763,STOKES,763,What now? What do we do now?!
764,BURKE,764,Survival of the fittest!
765,NORA,765,Sheldon!!! Get down!!!
766,RANDOLPH,766,"Give me that gun, you fucking
wacked-out freak!"
767,RANDOLPH,767,You okay?
768,RANDOLPH,768,"I don't know. I'm kind of fucked
up in general, so it's hard to
gauge."
769,NORA,769,"Burke's with Stokes.   He's been in
it all along."
770,NORA,770,"No, Sheldon, don't!"
771,BURKE,771,"You fucking point a gun at me? A
gun I gave you as a gift?! Where's
your fucking etiquette?"
772,NORA,772,Let him go.
773,NORA,773,"Now. Before I pump one in that
Grecian Formula scalp of yours."
774,BURKE,774,"You know something, kid? You've
turned out to be an incredible
pain in the ass."
775,SHELDON,775,"You were behind the Spinner hit,
weren't you?"
776,BURKE,776,That was a tragic mistake.
777,BURKE,777,If only one could turn back time...
778,BURKE,778,"But what the hell, it's just one
less mick in the world."
779,NORA,779,You son-of-a-bitch.
780,BURKE,780,"Oh my. What are you gonna do?
Kill me? That wouldn't be very
Smoochy-like behavior."
781,SHELDON,781,"You're right. There's just one
thing..."
782,SHELDON,782,I'm not Smoochy.
783,SHELDON,783,"I finally realized we're living in
a different jungle."
784,NORA,784,"No, Sheldon."
785,NORA,785,Sheldon!
786,VOICE (O.S.),786,"Don't do it, Shel."
787,SHELDON,787,"Stay out of it, Tommy.   This is my
business."
788,TOMMY,788,"No more killin', Shel. Enough's
enough. Don't destroy who you are
for this piece of shit. You mean
something to the kids. Don't take
Smoochy away from the kids."
789,SHELDON,789,"I don't know how I got pushed this
far."
790,TOMMY,790,"You're only human, Shel. The
important thing is... you never
went over the cliff. You're a
good boy. For some of us... it's
too late."
791,TOMMY,791,"We'll take it from here, kid, you
run along with your girl. Get on
with your life."
792,SHELDON,792,"Tommy, you're not going to --"
793,TOMMY,793,"Don't worry. Sometimes even a
rat deserves a little mercy."
794,NORA,794,Bus backfire.
795,STOKES,795,Get out of here!
796,STOKES,796,Move this thing!
797,STOKES,797,Are you deaf?! I said --
798,CHICK,798,"I wish I could tell you it'll be
quick and painless, Frank, but you
know how these things go..."
799,SHELDON,799,"You know, a little grime here and
there doesn't change the fact...
it's still a beautiful city."
800,NORA,800,"Let's go home, Smoochy.    Show's
over."
801,SHELDON,801,No it's not. It's just beginning.
802,ANNOUNCER (V.O.),802,"And now... it gives us great
pleasure to introduce America's
favorite rhino... ladies and
gentlemen... boys and girls..."
803,ANNOUNCER (V.O.),803,Heeeeeere's Smoochy!
804,ANNOUNCER (V.O.),804,"With his partner and comrade...
the one, the only... Rainbow
Randolph!"
805,ANNOUNCER (V.O.),805,"All proceeds from tonight's
performance, will benefit the
Rainbow Randolph Center for
Alcoholism and Delusional
Behavior."
