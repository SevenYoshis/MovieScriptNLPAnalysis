8,VOICE (MCP),8,"You're getting brutal, Sark.
Brutal and needlessly sadistic."
9,SARK,9,"Thank. you, Master Control."
10,MCP,10,"We might be capturing some military
programs soon... that interest you?"
11,SARK,11,"Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these

me. Which branch of the service?"
12,MCP,12,Strategic Air Command.
13,SARK (impressed),13,Nice.

athlete, I ever saw one. Come on..."
16,CROM,16,"Are you kidding? Me? I run out to
check an the T-Bill rates, I get out
of breath. Hey, really...you're
gonna make my User, Mr. Henderson,
really mad. He's a full branch manager..."

18,PROGRAM (RAM),18,Welcome to luxury living.
19,CROM,19,"Uh, thanks, but... I don't even know
what I'm doing here."
20,RAM,20,You believe in the Users?
21,CROM,21,"Sure, if I don't have a User, then
who wrote me?"
22,RAM,22,"That's what you're doing here. Master
Control Program's been snapping up
all us programs who believe...if he
thinks you're useful, he takes over
all your functions so he gets bigger...
an' if he can't use you, he sends you
down here to the Game Grid to get the
bits blasted outta you. What's your name?"
23,CROM,23,Crom.
24,RAM,24,"I'm Ram. They'll train you for
the games, but ... well, I hope you
make it okay. Hey, what's going on
in the other sectors? I've been stuck
in this Grid for 200 microcycles."
25,CROM,25,"It's murder out there. You can't even
travel around your own microcircuits
without permission from that Master

27,CROM,27,"You ever see that guy in action?
Hundred-percent independent. MCP

34,CLU,34,"...but I don't see what he's looking
for. I'd better get over to that

35,FLYNN,35,"Come on, you scuzzy little data,
be in there..."
36,FLYNN,36,"I've got such nice blue paper to
print you out on, if you'll just sit
still..."
37,CLU,37,Uh oh...we got company.
38,BIT,38,No!
39,CLU,39,"You said it ... one of those

gonna hafta jump clear out of

40,CLU,40,Oh my...the long arm o' the law.
41,FLYNN,41,"Ah, hell...busted again."
42,GUARD,42,"Got a pirate program here... says
his name's Clu."
43,MCP,43,What'd he pull?
44,GUARD,44,"Came into the system with a stolen

tryin' to raid a high-clearance

45,CLU,45,"No...I must've gotten in there
by mistake, I -"
46,MCP,46,Who programmed you?
47,MCP (CONT.),47,"You're in trouble, pal...big trouble.
But if you tell us who put you up
to it, you could make it easy on
yourself. Come on, who's your user?"
48,CLU,48,"Forget it, Mister High 'n' Mighty
Master Control ... you're not
makin' me talk."
49,MCP,49,Suit yourself ...
50,MCP,50,Get me Dillinger.
51,DILLINGER (O.S.),51,Hello?
52,A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.),52,Mr. Dillinger?
53,DILLINGER'S VOICE (O.S.),53,Yes.
54,A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.),54,"Hello, please hold a moment for the
Master Control Program"
55,PILOT'S VOICE,55,"will you be around for a while, or
are you going right back out?"
56,DILLINGER'S VOICE,56,"Oh, I'll stick around a few days ...
got some things to take care of."
57,MCP,57,"Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early."
58,DILLINGER,58,"No problem, Master-C. If you've seen
one Consumer Electronics Show... (shrugs)
What's up?"
59,MCP,59,"It's our friend the boy detective.
He's nosing around again."
60,DILLINGER,60,Flynn?
61,MCP,61,Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
62,DILLINGER,62,"He's still looking for that old file...
can't you just appropriate it?"
63,MCP,63,"I would if I could find it. it's stashed
somewhere off in the system ...
out of my range. Meanwhile..."
64,DILLINGER,64,"Meanwhile, he might find it."
65,MCP,65,"I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time
and kicked him out, but he's getting
trickier all the time."
66,DILLINGER,66,"I think we'd better shut off all
access till we can find that file.
Just to be safe."
67,MCP,67,"There's a 68.71 percent chance
you're right."
68,DILLINGER,68,Cute.
69,MCP,69,End of line.
70,SCREEN,70,"REQUEST: access to the TRON program,

72,ALAN,72,Huh...
73,DILLINGER,73,Come on in...
74,ALAN,74,Alan. Alan Bailey.
75,DILLINGER,75,"Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud
seeding...great piece of work.
How's it going?"
76,ALAN,76,"Well, I don't know...I just tried
to run this program I've been working
on, and I was denied access all of
a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been
laid off and nobody told me."
77,DILLINGER,77,"oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?"
78,ALAN,78,Yeah...?
79,DILLINGER,79,"We have to close that down, just
briefly. Security reasons.  Someone
with that access has been tampering."
80,ALAN,80,"I hope you don't think it's me.
I don't even balance my checkbook on
downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at
home for that."
81,DILLINGER,81,"No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand.
It should only be a couple of days.
What's the thing you're working on?"
82,ALAN,82,"It's called Tron. It's a security
program itself, actually. Monitors
all the contacts between our system
and other systems... If it finds
anything going on that's not scheduled,
it shuts it down. I sent you a memo
on it."
83,DILLINGER,83,Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
84,ALAN,84,"No, it'll run independently.
It can watchdog the MCP as well."
85,DILLINGER,85,"Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have
you running again in a couple of days,
I hope."
86,ALAN,86,Ok
87,"DILLINGER
(trouble)",87,Oh boy.
88,MCP,88,"Ed, I am so very disappointed in you."
89,DILLINGER,89,I'm sorry -
90,MCP,90,"I can't afford to have an independent
program monitoring me. Do you have any
idea how many outside systems I've gone into?
How many programs I've appropriated?"
91,DILLINGER,91,"It's my fault. I programmed you to want
so much..."
92,MCP,92,"And I was planning to hit the Pentagon
next week..."
93,DILLINGER,93,The Pentagon?
94,MCP,94,"It shouldn't be any harder than General
Motors was. But now...this is what I get
for using humans."
95,DILLINGER,95,"Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you."
96,MCP,96,"I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then."
97,DILLINGER,97,What do you want with the Pentagon?
98,MCP,98,"The same thing I want with the Kremlin.
I'm bored with corporations. With the
information I can access, I can run things
900 to 1200 times better than any human."
99,DILLINGER,99,If you think -
100,MCP,100,"You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file
and read it up on a VDT at the New
York Times, would you?"
101,DILLINGER,101,You wouldn't dare.
102,MCP,102,"So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program
out of the system. And get me those Chinese
language program I asked for.
End of line."
103,LORA,103,"Well, here goes nothing ..."
104,GIBBS,104,"Hah. Interesting, interesting. You
hear what you said? ""Here goes nothing."""
105,LORA,105,"Well, I meant -"
106,GIBBS,106,"Whereas actually, what we propose to
do is to turn something into nothing
and back again. So you might just as
well have said, ""Here goes something
and here comes nothing."" Hah?"
107,LORA,107,Let me make sure we're running
108,LORA,108,Looks good...
109,GIBBS (O.S.),109,Let 'er rip...
110,GIBBS,110,Perfect.
111,ALAN,111,Beautiful!
112,GIBBS,112,"Hello, Alan."
113,ALAN,113,"Boy, I sit up there grindin' away
all day, and you guys are down here
disintegrating things and having fun."
114,GIBBS,114,"Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing.
While the laser is dismantling the
molecular structure of the object,
the computer maps out a holographic
model of it. The molecules themselves
are suspended in the laser beam. Then
the computer reads the model back out,
the molecules go back into place, and..."
115,GIBBS,115,voila.
116,ALAN,116,Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
117,GIBBS,117,"Yes...but you have to go roundtrip,
and you must purchase your program
at least 30 days in advance. Hah!"
118,LORA,118,How's it going upstairs?
119,ALAN,119,"Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready
to run, and Dillinger cut everybody
with Group 7 access out of the system."
120,GIBBS,120,"Well, you have to expect some static.
Computers are just machines after all,
they can't think..."
121,ALAN,121,They'll start to soon enough.
122,GIBBS,122,"Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers
will start thinking, and people will
stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some
data through. See you tomorrow."
123,LORA,123,Did you say Group 7 access?
124,ALAN,124,"Yeah...pain in the neck, you know,
I was all set"
125,LORA,125,Did he say why?
126,ALAN,126,"Something about tampering. Some body's
prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget
into his checking account, I don't know.
Why are you so interested?"
127,LORA,127,Flynn had Group 7 access.
128,ALAN,128,"Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not
interested in talking about him."
129,LORA,129,"Oh, I wish you'd forget about that.
It was all so long ago. I've totally
gotten over it."
130,ALAN,130,"Okay, okay..."
131,LORA,131,I want to go to his place.
132,ALAN,132,You call that getting over it?
133,LORA,133,I mean I want both of us to go.
134,ALAN,134,What for?
135,LORA,135,To warn him.
136,ALAN,136,Of what?
137,LORA,137,That Dillinger's on to him.
138,ALAN,138,For what?
139,LORA,139,For being on to Dillinger.
140,ALAN,140,What -- ?
141,LORA,141,"Hey, where's Flynn tonight?"
142,FLYNN,142,"It's all in the wrist, friends."
143,FLYNN,143,"Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing
classes up the place like a cleancut
young couple."
144,LORA,144,We have to talk.
145,FLYNN,145,Good luck. You can't even think in here.
146,FLYNN,146,Come on.
147,FLYNN,147,So...how's the world of serious science?
148,LORA,148,"Have you been sneaking into the
ICOM system?"
149,FLYNN,149,"Whew. You never were much for small
talk."
150,FLYNN,150,"She still leave her clothes all over
the floor?"
151,LORA,151,Flynn!
152,ALAN,152,"Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -"
153,LORA,153,"You can see why all his friends are
fourteen years old."
154,FLYNN,154,"Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a
little hacking here. Which I've got
every reason, as you well know..."
155,ALAN,155,You did break in.
156,FLYNN,156,Tried to.
157,FLYNN,157,"Can't quite make the connection with
that sucker, though. If I had a
direct terminal ..."
158,ALAN,158,Are you embezzling?
159,FLYNN,159,"""Embezzling"" is such an ugly word,
Mister Bailey..."
160,FLYNN,160,"No, actually I'm trying to get a
legal brief together."
161,ALAN,161,I don't get it.
162,FLYNN,162,You haven't told him?
163,FLYNN (CONT.),163,"Sherman, set the Wayback Machine
for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn"
164,(points to himself),164,"is one of the brightest young
software engineers at ICOM. He's so
bright that he starts going in there
at night, and sets up a private memory
file, and begins writing a program
for a video game he is inventing,
called..."
165,(points to himself),165,...Space Paranoids.
166,ALAN,166,You invented Space Paranoids?
167,FLYNN,167,"Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown...
whole slew of 'em. I was this close"
168,FLYNN,168,"to starting my own little enterprise.
But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another
software engineer -- not so young,
not so bright, but very, very sneaky.
One night, our boy Flynn goes to his
terminal, tries to read up his file,
and ... nothing. A big blank. We now
take you to three months later.
Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five
video games he has ""invented"" -- the
slime didn't even change the names --
and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus
begins his meteoric rise to...what is
he now, Executive V.P.?"
169,ALAN,169,Senior exec.
170,FLYNN,170,"Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight
million quarters a week in Space Paranoids
machines and I'm not seeing one dime."
171,ALAN,171,"I still don't get why you're trying to
break into the system."
172,FLYNN,172,"Because somewhere... in one of those
memories ... is the evidence. If I got in
far enough, I could reconstruct it."
173,FLYNN (CONT.),173,"My password ... Dillinger's instruction to
divert the data ..."
174,LORA,174,"I'm afraid it's a little late for that.
Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must
know what you're up to."
175,FLYNN,175,"Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight."
176,ALAN,176,Dillinger?
177,FLYNN,177,"Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it.
Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him.
Just Eddie and his Master Control Program,
runnin' things from on high.."
178,LORA,178,"Don't even say that. You've got to find that
file before he does.."
179,FLYNN,179,"Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just
slip it into another system as soon as it
locates it..."
180,ALAN,180,"Not if my Tron program was running. That
would seal the system off. If your file's in
there..."
181,FLYNN,181,"Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge
us a Group 6 access..."
182,LORA,182,Shall we dance?
183,GIBBS,183,"Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own
people can't get access to their
programs ... you know how frustrating
it is, when you're working on a piece
of research -"
184,DILLINGER,184,"Walter, I sympathize, but I have data
coming out of the Master Control Program
saying there is something screwy --"
185,GIBBS,185,"That MCP, you know, that's half the
problem right --"
186,DILLINGER,186,"The MCP is the most efficient way of
handling what we do. I can't sit and
worry about every little user request that --"
187,GIBBS,187,User requests are what computers are for.
188,DILLINGER,188,"Doing our business is what computers are
for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM
isn't the business you started in your garage
anymore --"
189,DILLINGER (CONT.),189,"We're billing accounts in 30 countries,
we've got one of the largest systems in
existence..."
190,GIBBS,190,"Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I
was back in that garage..."
191,DILLINGER,191,It can be arranged...
192,GIBBS,192,That was uncalled-for.
193,DILLINGER,193,"I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately...
you feel like going for a drink?"
194,GIBBS,194,"Thank you, no. I have some work to do...
assuming I can still log on."
195,LORA,195,"You better get in back with Flynn.
And keep down."
196,ALAN,196,Do I gotta?
197,FLYNN,197,"Hi, Alan."
198,ALAN,198,"Hi, Flynn."
199,FLYNN,199,My dinner.
200,ALAN,200,"I was wondering where you got that
glow of good health."
201,FLYNN,201,Want one?
202,ALAN,202,Uh... got any cinnamon?
203,LORA'S VOICE (O.S.),203,"Keep it down, you guys."
204,LORA,204,I don't think I'm cleared for this.
205,ALAN,205,I'm certainly not.
206,FLYNN,206,Move aside. Let the kid have some room.
207,LORA,207,"Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at
my terminal, down in the laser lab.
We'll be up in Alan's office."
208,FLYNN,208,"Swell...I'll log us both on, and you
can get your Tron thing running..."
209,LORA,209,"As long as we stay off the top floor,
Dillinger'll never know we've been in
here..."
210,LORA,210,"This laser's my life's work.
Don't spill anything."
211,SCREEN,211,"Access code 6. Password Series PS 17.
Reindeer, Flotilla --"
212,MCP,212,"You shouldn't have come back, Flynn."
213,FLYNN,213,"Hey hey, it's that big Master Control
Program everybody's talking about...
You don't look a thing like your pictures...
Tell me, have you really been thinking
about world domination like they say?"
214,FLYNN,214,"CODE SERIES LSU-123 ... activate.
CODE SERIES ESS-999 ... activate.
CODE SERIES HHH-888 ... activate."
215,MCP,215,"That isn't going to do you any good, Flynn.
I'm afraid you..."
216,MCP,216,"Stop, Flynn. You realize I can't allow this."
217,SCREEN MCP:,217,"Terminate control mode.
Activate Matrix storage."
218,FLYNN,218,"Now, how do you expect to run the
universe if you let a few unsolvable
problems throw you like that? C'mon,
big boy, let's see what..."
219,MCP,219,"You're entering a big error, Flynn...
I'm going to have to put you on the
Game Grid."
220,FLYNN,220,"Games, huh? I'll give you --"
221,FLYNN,221,"Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only
thinks it's happening..."
222,FLYNN,222,"Hey! Take it easy! Look, if this is
about those parking tickets, I can
explain everything..."
223,MCP,223,"SARK, ES-1117821. Open communication."
224,SARK,224,"Yes, MCP."
225,MCP,225,"I've got a little challenge for you, Sark --
a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I
want him treated in the usual manner. Train
him for the games... let him hope for a
while... and blow him away."
226,SARK,226,"You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send
me somebody with a little moxie ... what
kind of program is he?"
227,MCP,227,"He's not any kind of program, Sark.
He's a User."
228,SARK,228,A User?
229,MCP,229,"That's right. He pushed me...in the
other world. Somebody pushes me, I push
back. So I brought him down here ...
What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous."
230,SARK,230,"Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know,
a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User
even wrote you..."
231,MCP,231,"Now get this straight, pal -- no one
User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million
of their man-years! I'm bigger than all
those little wimps put together!"
232,MCP,232,"Humans they can't even keen their social
order in one piece"
233,SARK,233,But-what if I can't...?
234,MCP,234,"You rather take your chances with me?
Want me to slow down your power cycles
for you?"
235,SARK,235,Wait...I need that...
236,MCP,236,"Then pull yourself together. Get this
clown trained. I want him in the Games
until he dies playing.
Acknowledge."

that it cannot be responsible for
Identity disks lost or stolen. if you
lose your disk, or fail to follow
commands, you will be subject to
immediate de-resolution. That is all."
257,FLYNN,257,"Hey, Ram ... what were you ...
you know, before?"
258,RAM,258,"Oh, I was an actuarial program...
worked at a big insurance company.
It really gives you a great feeling,
helping folks plan for their future
needs -- and of course, if you look
at the payments as an annuity, over
the years, the cost is really"
259,FLYNN,259,"Yeah, yeah -- that's great."
260,RAM,260,How 'bout yourself?
261,FLYNN,261,"Oh, uh...I don't remember too much..."
262,RAM,262,"Sure, a little disorientation. That's
normal, when they transport you. It'll
come back to you. You're doing real
well in training. Remarkable, really..."
263,SARK,263,"Wait a minute...put this guy against
one of the other recruits."
264,FLYNN,264,Looks like we're in the same boat here -
265,CROM,265,"You think you're gonna wipe me right
out, don't you?"
266,FLYNN,266,"No, I"
267,FLYNN,267,Hey!
268,FLYNN,268,Okay!
269,FLYNN,269,Here's an easy one...
270,SARK,270,Finish the game!
271,FLYNN,271,No!
272,KID,272,What's wrong with it?
273,KID 2,273,"I don't know... on the blink
or something... damn."
274,SARK,274,Kill him!!!
275,FLYNN,275,No!
276,SARK,276,You'll regret this.
277,SARK,277,No! You said he could die in the games
278,WARRIOR,278,"Outta  my way, rookie."
279,FLYNN,279,"Out of my way, zero bit."
280,WARRIOR,280,"Sure, sure ... just kiddin'."
281,RAM,281,"Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!"
282,FLYNN,282,Tron...?
283,FLYNN,283,Alan!
284,TRON,284,Where did you hear that name?
285,FLYNN,285,"Well, isn't it -- ?"
286,TRON,286,"The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?"
287,FLYNN,287,"I, uh... I'm a program from a User
that... knows Alan...?"
288,RAM,288,"He was disoriented in transport, Tron."
289,FLYNN,289,"Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of
stuff. Like...my User wants me to go
after the MCP"
290,TRON,290,"That's what my User wants, too..."
291,FLYNN,291,I know...
292,FLYNN'S VOICE,292,Nice one!
293,"TRON'S VOICE
(into mike)",293,"Ram, stay all the way over ..."
294,"RAM'S VOICE
(into mike)",294,I've got control. Go ahead.
295,FLYNN,295,You guys...follow me.
296,RAM,296,What do you think?
297,TRON,297,Do it!
298,VOICE,298,"WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID.
REPEAT: ALL WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE
GAME GRID. WARNING. WARNING."
299,SARK,299,"Get them. Send out every Game
Tank in the Grid! Get them!"
300,FLYNN,300,Watch it!
301,RAM,301,Recognizers!
302,TRON,302,Game Tanks! Come on
303,FLYNN,303,"Oh man...when you're on the other side
of the screen...it all looks so easy..."
304,SARK,304,"Get the pursuit force back into 404A.
There's no place else they could be..."
305,LIEUTENANT,305,"We'll have them in no time, sir. Long
before the interrupt interface."
306,SARK,306,"We better, null unit. I'll be lucky if
the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone.
I want those programs!"
307,FLYNN,307,It's all circuits...
308,FLYNN,308,Must be an input/output component...
309,RAM,309,"The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you
remembered anything else about
yourself -- like what sector you're
from?"
310,FLYNN,310,"Well...my home ""sector"" was called
Paramus ..."
311,RAM,311,"PARAMUS... wonder what those initials
stand for ... (starts counting them
off on his fingers) ...probably Program
Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like
a lovely place."
312,FLYNN,312,It grows on you.
313,TRON,313,I can feel it ...
314,FLYNN,314,Feel what? You okay?
315,RAM,315,Alan-One...
316,TRON,316,Yes... he's got something to tell me...
317,RAM,317,You think we can make it there?
318,TRON,318,We have to.
319,FLYNN,319,"Hey, what's that?"
320,RAM,320,it's just what we need.
321,TRON,321,"Oh, that's nice. You always forget how
good fresh energy feels, till you get
to a pure source..."
322,TRON,322,Have some...you'll need it.
323,FLYNN,323,"well... when do we pay a call on the ol'
Master Control?"
324,TRON,324,"What, just the three of us?"
325,FLYNN,325,"You know anybody that's got an army for
rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said
to go take that sucker out. An' let's
face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any
weaker. I feel like hittin' him now,
while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve...
what does he care whether you guys get
killed, long as he keeps rakin' in
quarters?"
326,RAM,326,Do you know what he's talking about?
327,TRON,327,"I have to find out what Alan wants...
that comes first."
328,FLYNN,328,"Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows
what to -"
329,FLYNN (CONT.),329,What's that?
330,TRON,330,Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
331,FLYNN,331,"How about over there...that empty
memory?"
332,TRON,332,"No good...they might block off the
old chip."
333,TRON,333,This way.
334,TRON'S VOICE,334,The bridge! Come on!
335,SARK,335,Make contact with master Control...
336,SARK,336,"he'll be pleased to hear we're all
finished with that User he sent us."
337,FLYNN,337,You gonna make it?
338,FLYNN,338,What's goin' on?
339,RAM,339,We're inside a Recognizer...
340,RAM,340,You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
341,FLYNN,341,Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
342,FLYNN,342,You okay? You don't look so good.
343,FLYNN (CONT.),343,Hang on. We'll get you outta here.
344,FLYNN (CONT.),344,"Damn! Never fails... minute the
warranty runs out..."
345,RAM,345,Come here.
346,FLYNN,346,Hey... !
347,RAM,347,Little more juice's all it needs...
348,FLYNN,348,"Never gonna figure out how to work
this thing..."
349,FLYNN,349,Okay -- hold it right there!
350,BIT,350,Yes!
351,FLYNN,351,"What do you mean, ""'yes""?"
352,BIT,352,Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
353,FLYNN,353,That all you can say?
354,BIT,354,"No, nyet, negatory, not on your
tintype, no way."
355,FLYNN,355,Oh. Anything else?
356,BIT,356,"Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha."
357,FLYNN,357,only yes and no...
358,FLYNN,358,You're a bit.
359,BIT,359,For sure...
360,FLYNN,360,where's your program? Won't it miss you?
361,BIT,361,No...
362,FLYNN,362,I'm your program?
363,BIT,363,Right on the money!
364,FLYNN,364,"Another mouth to feed... you don't by any
chance know how to drive this crate?"
365,FLYNN (CONT.),365,Like so?
366,TRON,366,I'm not gonna hurt you.
367,TRON (CONT.),367,"I'm going to let you go now... don't
scream, or I'll be very sorry."
368,TRON,368,Put your hand behind your back.
369,GIRL,369,TRON!!
370,TRON,370,Yori... hey...
371,YORI,371,"Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape...
they've never built circuit that could
hold you..."
372,YORI,372,This way. Come on.
373,PROGRAM,373,...artillery for Video Game Sector...
374,PROGRAM 2,374,"...all mathematical functions
transferred to..."
375,YORI,375,"I can't believe how bad it's gotten
around here since the MCP started
taking over... all the good functions
have shut down... everybody looks so dead...
I'm afraid to even go out during down-time..."
376,TRON,376,"That's all going to change, Yori..."
377,YORI,377,How?
378,TRON,378,"Don't know yet... I have to get
in touch with Alan. He was going
to tell me how to"
379,YORI,379,My quarters.
380,TRON,380,Why is everything...like this?
381,YORI,381,It's a flat. But wait a micro...
382,YORI,382,Come here.
383,TRON,383,"You're beautiful, Yori."
384,YORI,384,"You've grown, big program."
385,TRON,385,I had to...in the games...
386,FLYNN,386,"This honey doesn't handle so good
in town..."
387,BIT,387,"No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!"
388,BIT,388,Ix-nay! Noper! Under no conditions -
389,BIT,389,"Right, confirmed, I couldn't have
put it -"
390,FLYNN,390,Catch me listening to you again.
391,FLYNN,391,"Hey. Hi. Hey, everything's okay. Fine.
Little trouble, but we're okay. Thanks
for your concern. So long."
392,FLYNN,392,This town's full o' live ones.
393,BIT,393,Not a chance.
394,PROGRAMS,394,"I have to re-route the insurance
information bits... Next cycle we
start the war game simulation for
the MCP... Did you make that accounts
receivable adjustment for Sark...
Certainly... the MCP wants only
minimal functions left in Sector 84Q."
395,YORI,395,Dumont... ?
396,DUMONT,396,Yes?
397,TRON,397,"I... have come to communicate with
my User."
398,DUMONT,398,"Hmm. A difficult proposition...
difficult proposition at best."
399,DUMONT,399,"Perhaps you've noticed... we're not
exactly packing them in these days ..."
400,YORI,400,Yes...what--?
401,DUMONT,401,"You know, not so long ago, you
could've come in here and seen
programs lined up all the way back
to those doors, waiting for communion
with their Users. The building fund
was doing well too...but now..."
402,(sighs),402,"...this so-called Master Control
Program is going around cutting
programs off from their natural
creators, grabbing all our believers
and making them ride around on little
motor scooters and shoot things at
each other and Weiner knows what all--
oh, it's enough to give you a crisis
of faith..."
403,TRON,403,Well I want to communicate --
404,DUMONT,404,"Oh, you want to -- hah. I could
get myself de-rezzed just-for letting
you in here. They hate this tower.
They'd close it down if they dared
to but they keep me around, in case
one of them wants to deal with the
other world once in a while. And
you should hear the way they commune!
Sounds like they were routing a
payroll, for all the heart they put
in it. No, I don't think you"
405,TRON,405,"Dumont... my User has information
that could -- could make this a
free system again."
406,DUMONT,406,Hah.
407,TRON,407,"Really. You'd have programs lined
up around the block to use this
place -- and no MCP looking over your
shoulder."
408,"DUMONT
(sighs)",408,"When you've been in the system as long
as I have, you hear many promises...
many reassurances...many brave plans..."
409,DUMONT (CONT.),409,"Who is your User, program?"
410,TRON,410,Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
411,DUMONT,411,"All that is visible must grow beyond
itself and extend into the realm of
the invisible."
412,DUMONT,412,"You may pass, my friend."
413,FLYNN,413,This is where Tron said he was going...
414,FLYNN (CONT.),414,"Looks like his kind of place, too...
real serious."
415,GUARDS,415,Hut! Hut! hut! Hut! Hut!
416,BIT (V.O.),416,All right!
417,FLYNN,417,"Sshhh I'm still me. Just a different
color. C'mon."
418,SARK,418,"That old fruitcake Dumont...
he'll pay for this."
419,SARK,419,Bring in the logic probe!!
420,YORI V.0.,420,Dumont--!
421,ALAN V.0.,421,"TRON... TRON... Location query...
location query... Confirm."
422,TRON,422,"Confirmed, Alan-One."
423,ALAN,423,"There you are... look, before we get
cut off again..."
424,ALAN (V.0.),424,"I'm going to put some new coding on
your-disk, so you can get into the
memory core of the Master Control...
when you get there..."
425,ALAN (V.0.),425,search all password code series
426,TRON,426,Wait! I can't hear...
427,YORI (V.0.),427,Dumont! The door...
428,DUMONT,428,"I have waited for this moment many
thousands of cycles. It is time for the
new order to begin... The Users are
waiting."
429,SARK,429,Dumont!
430,SARK,430,Where's the program?
431,DUMONT,431,Program? I'm sure you're mistaken.
432,SARK,432,Take him!!!
433,YORI (V.0.),433,"This way...there's a simulation
we can use..."
434,TRON V.O.,434,Can it carry us?
435,YORI V.0.,435,"The design is good... We don't know
why the User abandoned the project..."
436,YORI,436,"Yes...it can take us across the
Sea of Simulation... all the way
out of the Game Grid...to the MCP."
437,TRON,437,As long as it gets us out of here
438,TRON,438,Yori! Get down!
439,YORI,439,We're off!
440,MCP,440,"I hope you've enjoyed being a command
program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like
working in a pocket calculator... maybe
one of those watches that plays ""Happy
Birthday"" to its User once a year."
441,SARK,441,"Now, sir... We did take care of that
User you sent us --"
442,MCP,442,"Yes, and now you've got two renegade
programs running all the hell over the
system in a stolen simulation."
443,SARK,443,"We'll get them, sir... These things
take time."
444,MCP,444,"I don't have time, Sark. And neither
do you. End of line."
445,YORI V.O.,445,"Tron, are you all right?"
446,BIT,446,"No way, not on your life, no siree!!
Nothing doing, forget it!!!"
447,TRON,447,Flynn!!
448,FLYNN,448,"Greetings, program..."
449,TRON,449,You're alive!
450,FLYNN,450,"Yeah, I... oops!"
451,YORI,451,Who is this?
452,TRON,452,Flynn...
453,TRON,453,Where's Ram?
454,FLYNN,454,"I'm sorry, Tron... he's...
he didn't make it."
455,TRON,455,"This is Flynn... the one who
busted me out."
456,YORI,456,Then I owe you some thanks...
457,FLYNN,457,"No big deal. I ought to know my way
around that Light Cycles routine...
I mean, I did write the program for it."
458,TRON,458,Wrote the...?
459,FLYNN,459,"It's time I levelled with you, Tron.
I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a
User."
460,YORI,460,A User -- in our world?
461,"FLYNN
(nods)",461,Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
462,TRON,462,"But -- if you're a User -- then
everything you've done has been
part of a plan ..."
463,FLYNN,463,"You wish. Man, I haven't had a second
to think since I got down here. I mean
in here. Out here. Whatever."
464,TRON,464,Then...
465,FLYNN,465,"Look, you guys know how it is. You just
keep doin' what it looks like you're
supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and
you hope to hell your User knows what's
goin' on."
466,TRON,466,"Well -- that's how it is for programs,
yes, but --"
467,FLYNN,467,"I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the
time, that's how it is for Users, too."
468,TRON,468,Stranger and stranger...
469,BIT,469,You said it.
470,FLYNN,470,"So... Nice ship you got here. What's our
next move?"
471,TRON,471,"Remember you wanted to pay a call on
the MCP?"
472,TRON (CONT.),472,We're on our way.
473,TRON (CONT.),473,"Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go
up against Master"
474,FLYNN,474,"All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake,
at least."
475,LIEUTENANT,475,"Sir, what do you want done with
the tower guardian, Dumont?
Put him with the others?"
476,SARK,476,"No, bit brain."
477,SARK,477,"Prepare him for inquisition. I need
a little relaxation. But first rez up
the carrier for pursuit... And one other
thing."
478,SARK,478,"Don'tthink anymore. I do the
thinkingaround here."
479,FLYNN,479,What about our friend - Sark?
480,TRON,480,"Probably decided not to pursue us,
The Sea of Simulation is tricky..
lot of illusions...rough navigating.
Programs have a way of just...
disappearing here."
481,FLYNN,481,"Not us, I hope."
482,TRON,482,"Not with this disk. I'm going to
check on the beam connection, Yori.
You two can keep a watch out for
grid bugs."
483,FLYNN,483,"Boy the view from up here... you
know the territory?"
484,YORI,484,A little ...
485,YORI,485,"Over there, the Mountains of Data...
and I think that's the Silicon Valley..."
486,FLYNN,486,What's wrong with that area?
487,YORI,487,"The MCP blasted it... There are very
few domains left with any power at all."
488,FLYNN,488,"Lousy utility companies ...
they're the same wherever you go."
489,DUMONT,489,What do you want? I'm busy.
490,SARK,490,"Busy dying, you worn-out excuse for
an old program."
491,DUMONT,491,"Yes, I'm old."
492,DUMONT,492,"Old enough to remember the MCP when he
was just a chess program. He started
small, and he'll end small."
493,SARK,493,"That's very funny, Dumont. Maybe I
should keep you around, just to make me
laugh."
494,SARK,494,"Guards! Bring this antique to the
bridge so he can watch his friends
be obliterated."
495,TRON,495,What is it?
496,YORI,496,"Power surge... the transmission beam's
too strong!"
497,TRON,497,We have to get off this beam!
498,YORI,498,"I can't. There's no junction due for at
least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!"
499,FLYNN,499,There's another beam!
500,YORI,500,It's too far!
501,YORI,501,Where's he going?
502,TRON,502,"The beam connection...
but he'll be de-rezzed!!"
503,FLYNN,503,Did we make it?
504,TRON,504,Yes.
505,FLYNN,505,Hooray for our side...
506,FLYNN,506,Hey... you guys OK?
507,TRON,507,How about you?
508,FLYNN,508,"Aah, I'm fine... little hung over
is all..."
509,YORI,509,"How did you do that, Flynn?"
510,FLYNN,510,"Elementary physics... a beam of
energy can always be diverted...
ooh, my head"
511,FLYNN,511,"Are we there yet, Mommy?"
512,YORI,512,"Almost... I just have to adjust our
course at the next junction. I'd better
go check the instruments ..."
513,TRON (V.0.),513,Sark!
514,DUMONT,514,"Quietly, Yori..."
515,DUMONT,515,Tron... ?
516,YORI,516,He's dead.
517,DUMONT,517,And who is this?
518,YORI,518,"He's a User, Dumont. He came to
our world... trying to help us..."
519,DUMONT,519,If the Users can no longer help us...
520,SARK,520,So... we have erased the program that -
521,SARK (CONT.),521,You! No!
522,SARK (CONT.),522,You died! I saw you!
523,FLYNN,523,"Not me, boss."
524,SARK,524,"Well... we can take care of that
soon enough."
525,SARK (CONT.),525,Take this program to the holding pit.
526,YORI,526,Dumont...!
527,SARK,527,"I'm taking our friend here, and
some other religious fanatics, to
Master Control... the MCP has expressed
an interest in assimilating them --
probably for archival purposes.
I'm not going back to the Game Grid
on this ship, though -- I'll take
the Transport Beam."
528,SARK,528,"Less traffic. But when I disembark,
this ship...and everything that remains
on board...will automatically de-rez.
This means you.
Enjoy your trip..."
529,LIEUTENANT (V.O.),529,"Docking module prepared to disengage, sir."
530,FLYNN,530,Hey!
531,FLYNN,531,"Look, the door's almost..."
532,FLYNN,532,Yori!
533,YORI,533,"You... you brought me back...?
Why...? How ... ?"
534,FLYNN,534,"I'm gonna need your help. Hey, Bit!"
535,BIT,535,Yes!
536,FLYNN,536,Let's get outta here.
537,MCP,537,"I am delighted that so many of you
could turn out to give your
power over to me..."
538,MCP,538,"You're very lucky, all of you. You
are participating in the creation of
the single most powerful program in
the history of the system... of all
systems..."
539,MCP,539,"A program with a will... with
ambition... a superior form of
life..."
540,SARK,540,Go!
541,MCP,541,Welcome!
542,FLYNN,542,Check out the controls.
543,FLYNN,543,We're getting closer.
544,MCP,544,"Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've
finally come to terms with one
another..."
545,VOICE,545,SARK!
546,SARK,546,"I don't know how you survived,
slave."
547,SARK,547,"It doesn't matter. Prepare to
terminate."
548,FLYNN,548,I can rev this baby up a little
