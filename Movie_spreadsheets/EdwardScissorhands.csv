0,OLD KIM,0,"Snuggle in, sweetie. It's cold out there."
1,GRANDDAUGHTER,1,"Why is it snowing, grandma? Where does it come
from?"
2,OLD KIM,2,"Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart."
3,GRANDDAUGHTER,3,I want to hear.
4,OLD KIM,4,"Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep."
5,GRANDDAUGHTER,5,"I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please."
6,OLD KIM,6,"Well, all right. Let's see. I guess it would
have to start with scissors."
7,GRANDDAUGHTER,7,Scissors?
8,OLD KIM,8,"Well, there are all kinds of scissors. And once
there was even a man who had scissors for
hands."
9,GRANDDAUGHTER,9,A man?
10,OLD KIM,10,Yes.
11,GRANDDAUGHTER,11,"Hands, scissors?"
12,OLD KIM,12,"No, scissorhands. You know the mansion on top
of the mountain?"
13,GRANDDAUGHTER,13,It's haunted.
14,OLD KIM,14,"Well, a long time ago, an inventor lived in
that mansion. He made many things, I suppose.
He also created a man. He gave him inside, a
heart, a brain, everything. Well, almost
everything. You see, the inventor was very old.
He died before he got to finish the man he
invented. So the man was left by himself,
incomplete and all alone."
15,GRANDDAUGHTER,15,He didn't have a name?
16,OLD KIM,16,"Of course, he had a name. His name was Edward."
17,PEG,17,Avon calling.
18,HELEN,18,Weren't you just here?
19,PEG,19,"No, not since last season. Today I've come to
show you our exquisite new line of soft colors
in shadows, blushes and lipstick. Everything
you need to accent and highlight your changing
looks."
20,HELEN,20,My changing looks? That's good.
21,PEG,21,"Well, it goes that saying and I also have a
complete selection of your old favorites, those
tried-and-true products we've all come to
depend on year-in and year-out."
22,HELEN,22,"Come on, Peg. I never buy anything from you.
You know that?"
23,PEG,23,"I know. Bye, Helen."
24,REPAIRMAN,24,"You know, you didn't have to call me, ma'am.
You could have taken care of this by yourself."
25,JOYCE,25,I could? I don't think so.
26,REPAIRMAN,26,"Yeah, you see, it's easy. The food trap's
clogged. That's all. You see this bolt here?
You just unscrew this. OK? And out she pops."
27,JOYCE,27,"You know, on TV they say you repairmen are
lonely bunch of people. Housewives get lonely
too. Although you may not realize it since they
haven't made a commercial on the subject."
28,REPAIRMAN,28,"And then you just take this and put it back in
here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it,
because it fits in there by itself. And then
you just screw this back on."
29,JOYCE,29,"On no! Who could that be? Will you excuse me
for a moment? Now. Don't go anywhere. I'll be
right back. This is fascinating. I wouldn't
want to miss a moment of it."
30,PEG,30,"Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling."
31,JOYCE,31,"Why! Peg. Have you gone blind? Can't you see
there's a vehicle in my driveway?"
32,PEG,32,"Oh, yes."
33,JOYCE,33,"Well, I'm surprised you don't realize that
means I'm busy."
34,PEG,34,"Okay. Now, we should decide on lipsticks. Okay,
dear, what one did you like best? There was the
Winsome Wahini which looked charming on you. Or
the Bahenie Bliss."
35,A GIRL,35,I like them both.
36,PEG,36,"Well, great."
37,A GIRL,37,"You don't actually think I have any money, do
you?"
38,CHILDREN,38,"Ding, dong, the Avon lady."
39,PEG,39,It's just not my day.
40,PEG,40,"Oh, my goodness."
41,PEG,41,"Oh, it's so beautiful. Hello?"
42,PEG,42,"Hello? Avon calling, oh my. Hello, I'm Peg
Boggs. I'm your local Avon representative.
Hello. I'm sorry to barge in like this. But you
don't have any reason to be afraid. This is
some huge house, isn't it? Thank goodness for
those aerobics classes."
43,PEG,43,"Hello. Hello. Why are you hiding back there?
You don't have to hide from me. I'm Peg Boggs.
I'm your local Avon representative and I'm as
harmless as cherry pie."
44,PEG,44,"Oh my! I can see that I've disturbed you. How
stupid of me! I'll just be going now."
45,EDWARD,45,Don't go.
46,PEG,46,Oh my! What happened to you?
47,EDWARD,47,I'm not finished.
48,PEG,48,"Uh, put those down. Don't come any closer. Just
please... Those are your hands? Those are your
hands. What happened to you? Where are your
parents? Hum... Your mother? Your father?"
49,EDWARD,49,He didn't wake up.
50,PEG,50,"Are you alone? Do you live up here all by
yourself? What happened to your face? Hum, you
know, I won't hurt you. But at the very least
let me give you a good astringent and this will
help to prevent infection. What's your name?"
51,EDWARD,51,Edward.
52,PEG,52,"Edward? I think you should just come home with
me."
53,PEG,53,Oh!
54,EDWARD,54,I'm-I'm sorry.
55,PEG,55,"No, Don't be. You go ahead and look you have
every reason to be excited."
56,PEG,56,Oh! Are you ok?
57,EDWARD,57,Are you ok?
58,HELEN,58,Hello.
59,MARGIE,59,"Hi, it's Margie. Listen, I was standing outside
talking to Carol and Peg drove by, she had
somebody in the car."
60,HELEN,60,Did you get a good look?
61,MARGIE,61,"No, did she say anything to you, about having
guest?"
62,HELEN,62,"She didn't say anything. She rang my doorbell
early this morning."
63,MARGIE,63,"No, ok, I'll meet you on the corner. Right,
Bye."
64,HELEN,64,"Oh, damn!"
65,PEG,65,"Here we go, dear. This is our house. And you
can just go right in and make yourself right at
home. OK? And just, well have something to eat
or drink, whatever you... Here, dear. Here
you... This is the front door here, Here we go,
right in here."
66,A WOMAN,66,"Joyce, I just saw this strange guy drop in with
Peg. I didn't get a very good look at him. He
looked kind of pale. Okay, I'll be right there.
Don't do anything without me. Okay? Bye."
67,JOYCE,67,"Yes, I'll be right there."
68,PEG,68,"Here we are. So, oh, this is the living room
and back here, the bedrooms. You want to see
the pictures? All right. Well, this is my
husband, Bill. He's a bowling champion. Do you
know what bowling is? Bowling? Well, here they
are down at the lake, fishing. I think Kevin
looks a little glum Because they didn't catch
anything that day. And here's my daughter, Kim.
All dressed up the junior prom. She's a senior
now. I can't believe it. She's camping in the
mountains with some friends, but she'll be back
in a few days and you can meet her then. Isn't
she beautiful? That's my family. Now, go on,
dear. I'll show you the rest of the house. Then
you can just freshen up and make yourself at
home. Okay? That's the kitchen over there. You
help yourself to anything you want to eat or
drink. Those are grapes. Back here are the
bedrooms. Let me get you some towels, then I
will see what we can find to wear. You know
what? I think I have some of Bill's old clothes
in here. This is perfect. Here. These should
just fit you."
69,PEG,69,"Oh, no, no. Don't be alarmed. That's just a
phone. Now you can go in Kim's room and put
these on. I'll be right with you."
70,PEG,70,"No, no, scissors. That's right. Well, he was
born up there or something. Have you seen him
before? No, I don't think he's been off the
grounds before today. You're kidding. How did
you get together with him? I have to go. I'll
talk to you later Margie, Bye-bye."
71,PEG,71,"I'm sorry Edward, I didn't... oh, dear. May I
help you with this?"
72,EDWARD,72,Thank you.
73,PEG,73,"There you go. Oh, dear, you've cut your face.
Let me get this right off. Does that hurt?
Okay. No, good. Now let's get you dressed.
Okay. There we go. Very fine. You look fine,
just fine. Come on, we can't wait for you.
You've got rollers in your damn hair."
74,PEG,74,"Okay. Now what did I do with my sci... Edward,
um, would you. Thank you. I have a doctor
friend who I think could help you."
75,EDWARD,75,Really?
76,PEG,76,"Yes, I can help with the scars. I just want to
consult the Avon handbook before doing
anything."
77,PEG,77,"Kevin, it's not polite to stare. Think how it
would make you feel if somebody were staring at
you."
78,KEVIN,78,I wouldn't care.
79,PEG,79,"Well, I would, so don't do it!"
80,BILL,80,"This must be quite a change for you, Ed."
81,PEG,81,I think he prefers Edward.
82,BILL,82,"Sure. So what have you been doing up there in
that big old place? I bet the view must be
spectacular, Ed."
83,PEG,83,I was just...
84,BILL,84,See all the way to the ocean?
85,EDWARD,85,Sometimes.
86,PEG,86,"Bill, could I have the salt and pepper? Thank
you."
87,KEVIN,87,"Man, those things are cool. You know I bet
they're razor sharp. One karate chop to a guy's
neck..."
88,PEG,88,Would you like some butter for your bread?
89,PEG,89,Great.
90,EDWARD,90,Thank you.
91,KEVIN,91,Can I bring him to show and tell on Monday?
92,PEG,92,I've had enough.
93,PEG,93,"You think you can sleep? Things feel strange
now, but soon you'll feel right at home. Good
night."
94,PEG,94,"The light concealing cream goes on first, then
you blend and blend and blend. Blending is the
secret. More concealing for you? But you
complexion is so fair. Now this has a touch of
lavender in it. Give it a try here. Close
enough. OK. This should do the trick here. I
have another idea. We'll cover up the scars and
start with a completely smooth surface. Don't
eat this stuff!  Sports announcements on"
95,RADIO,95,"Hartely into the windup and the strike one
pitch. Swung on and missed strike two. If it's
a hit, the club has 12 hits. But they still
have 11 on the scoreboard and it's 3-1. 0 and 2
the count to Warren. Now they change it to 12
hits."
96,BILL,96,"Turn it up, Kevin. I can't hear it. Kevin! No,
make it louder. Sports announcements on"
97,RADIO,97,Hartely's strike two pitch is hammered.
98,KEVIN,98,"You hear that, Mr. Boggs?"
99,BILL,99,"No, make it louder.  Sports announcements on"
100,RADIO,100,"It's going way back. It's gone. It's out of
here. It is history."
101,KEVIN,101,"Dad, look!  Sports announcements on"
102,RADIO,102,"A grand slam for Martinez to make it a five-run
inning and blow this game to pieces."
103,BILL,103,I'll be darned.
104,PEG,104,They filled the whole tape.
105,RECORDED VOICES,105,"What's going on over there, Peg. Call me....Hi,
it's Margie. Who is he? Call me. Oh, by the
way, here it's pouring rain in the mountains.
You think the kids are okay?...Hi, there,
darling. The gals are all in a tizzy about your
secret visitor. You can't keep him a secret
forever."
106,BILL,106,"Boy, it's just wonderful, Ed. My god, you, you
have the whole family in there, don't you?"
107,KEVIN,107,"Edward, come here."
108,BILL,108,"No, no, no. That's a terrible idea, son. Go to
the garage and get the oil can. We don't want
him rusting up on this now, do we?"
109,PEG,109,"Edward, you did us? Oh, Bill. It's us."
110,BILL,110,"Yes, it is."
111,PEG,111,"Oh, Edward."
112,ESMERALDA,112,"It's not heaven he's from. It's straight from
the stinking flames of hell. The power of satan
is in him. I can feel it. God, you have the
poor sheep strayed so far from the path."
113,EDWARD,113,We are not sheep.
114,ESMERALDA,114,Don't come near me.
115,BILL,115,That's right. Go on. Get out of here. Run!
116,PEG,116,"Edward, don't you listen to her."
117,BILL,117,"Don't worry about her, Edward. She's just an
old lonely loony. That's all."
118,WOMEN,118,Hi!
119,JOYCE,119,"You are all hiding in there like a bunch of old
hermit crabs."
120,PEG,120,"Hi, Joyce. Hi!"
121,JOYCE,121,"Shame on you, keeping your unusual guest all to
yourself. We think that's mighty selfish of
you."
122,PEG,122,"No, it, it's... things have just been a little
hectic around here. That's all."
123,JOYCE,123,"Oh, that was so sweet of you to want to correct
the situation. What time does the barbecue
begin?"
124,PEG,124,Barbecue?
125,JOYCE,125,"Well, you intend to show your guest hospitality
by introducing him to your friends, don't you?"
126,ANOTHER WOMAN,126,I'll bring coleslaw.
127,JOYCE,127,"And I will bring the ambrosia salad. What time
was it that you said?"
128,PEG,128,What time? Ah... bill.
129,JOYCE,129,About five?
130,ESMERALDA,130,"He has been sent first to tempt you. But it's
not too late. You must push him from you. Expel
him. Trample down the perversion of nature."
131,JOYCE,131,"Did you hear that? He's the perversion of
nature. Wow, isn't that exciting? See you
later. Bye bye."
132,PEG,132,"I've always said that you really can't have a
picnic or a barbecue without deviled eggs.
They're just the best. They make the thing. Oh,
dear. Edward. That's wonderful. I didn't know
you chopped all those things. What a really
big..."
133,PEG,133,"Oh, all right now. It's just a nick. There's no
need to be nervous, dear. You know, Esmeralda
won't be here and the rest of neighbors there
are really very nice. There's no need to be
nervous. They are so eager to meet you. You
just have to be yourself."
134,EDWARD,134,Myself?
135,PEG,135,That's right. Just your own sweet self.
136,KEVIN,136,"Hey, play scissors, paper, stone with us."
137,EDWARD,137,Play scissors what?
138,NEIGHBOR,138,"I got a doctor friend might be able to help
you. Aren't they most incredible?"
139,PEG,139,He did them just like that.
140,TINKA,140,This afternoon?
141,AT THE PARTY,141,"Hi, Mike. How are you doing? Hello, Jack. Hey,
kid. Hey, Hi. George Morroe! Whoa! That's a
heck of handshake. Uh, Harry! Harry! I saw you
on the golf course. You got a dozen of the
melons..."
142,PEG,142,"Are you ok?  Do you want something to eat?  Are
you hungry? Do you want a cracker?"
143,MARGIE,143,"He's so... different completely different, No
kidding mysterious."
144,JOYCE,144,"Do you imagine those hands are hot or cold?
Just think what a single snip could do."
145,HELEN,145,Or undo.
146,GEORGE,146,"Eddie.  The guys and I were talking, we'd like
want to invite you to our card game on Friday
night. Would you like that? Only thing is, you
can't cut."
147,AN OLD MAN,147,"I have my own infirmity. Never did me a bit of
harm. Took some shrapnel during the war and
ever since then I can't feel a thing. Not a
damn thing. Listen Don't you ever let anybody
tell you you have a handicap."
148,JOYCE,148,"Who's handicapped? My goodness! Don't be
ridiculous. You're not handicapped. You're...
What do they call that? Exceptional. My name's
Joyce. And I noticed that you have not tasted
any of the ambrosia salad that I made
especially for you. Allow me."
149,WOMAN 1,149,You must try this.
150,MARGE,150,"You must try this.  It's my mother's recipe.
Let him chew, for heaven sakes with your green
thumb. I could use your help."
151,HOUSEWIFE,151,"Me, too. There you go."
152,WOMAN 2,152,I want a row of angels.
153,JOYCE,153,"Sorry, ladies. But he's promised to come to my
house first."
154,WOMAN 3,154,One more.
155,JOYCE,155,"Haven't you, Eddie?"
156,EDWARD,156,I did?
157,BILL,157,"Okay, everybody. Grab your plates. Soup's on."
158,EDWARD,158,I thought it was shish kebab.
159,BILL,159,What?
160,EDWARD,160,I thought it was shish kebab.
161,BILL,161,"Yeah, it, it is shish kebab. It was a figure of
speech, Ed. You got to learn not to take things
so literally."
162,INVENTOR,162,"Let us pretend we're in the drawing room, and
the hostess is serving tea ""Now, many numerous
little questions confront us"" ""Should the man
rise"" ""When he accepts his cup of tea?"" ""May
lump sugar be taken with the things?"""
163,EDWARD,163,"Hmm, no."
164,INVENTOR,164,"Is it good form to accept a second cup? ""Now,
should the napkin be entirely unfolded."" Oh
should the center crease. Be allowed to remain?
It is so easy to commit embarrassing
blunders. ""But etiquette humiliation and
discomfort. Mmm yes, boring. Let us switch to,
Um... To some poetry, Hmm?"" ""There was an old
man from the cape."" ""Who made himself there,
but they keep such a beautiful shape."" That's
right. Go ahead, smile. It's funny. That's
right."
165,DENNY,165,"Okay, guys, we're home. shh."
166,KIM,166,I can't believe. Everything's still sopping.
167,TEENAGE GIRL,167,I can't wait to take a shower.
168,SUZANNE,168,And wash off the mildew.
169,JIM,169,"If my parents set the alarm, I'm screwed I'll
sleep in the yard... again."
170,KIM,170,"I told you to call to say we're coming back
early."
171,DENNY,171,Did you?
172,SUZANNE,172,He'd rather complain.
173,JIM,173,"How else can I be the center of the attention?
You didn't call your parents."
174,KIM,174,"They don't run their house like a police
station. Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny. See
you later."
175,JIM,175,See you later. Bye.
176,KIM,176,Don't forget your arm.
177,JIM,177,"Oh, yeah."
178,DENNY,178,"Come on, Jim let's go."
179,KIM,179,"Bill! There's somebody in my room. Go. Look. A
murderer with an axe. He did try to even kill
me."
180,BILL,180,It's all right. It's all right.
181,BILL,181,Go back to bed. It's only Edward.
182,BILL,182,This way.
183,PEG,183,"Honey, that was Edward."
184,KIM,184,Who is he? What are you talking about?
185,PEG,185,"Edward's come to live with us. There's nothing
to be upset about. No, no. It's okay."
186,BILL,186,"We'll have you a setup here in a minute. Up
with your feet. A queen-size bed here. How do
you like that? It's all made up and everything.
There you go. What's the matter? What's wrong?
She gets you nervous? You've been closed up in
a way in that castle too long.  You don't know
anything about the wonderful world of teen-age
girls. They're all crazy. Here some. Straighten
that out."
187,EDWARD,187,What is it?
188,BILL,188,"Lemonade. I don't know what it is. They reach a
certain age. They develop these gland things.
Their bodies swell up. They go crazy."
189,EDWARD,189,Glands?
190,BILL,190,"yeah, glands. I try not to think about it"
191,BILL,191,Good. Isn't it?
192,PEG,192,"Now you stay in Kevin's room tonight. Tomorrow
we'll fix your room right."
193,KIM,193,"Mom, why did you have to bring him in here?"
194,PEG,194,"Oh, honey, I couldn't have left him there all
alone. You would have done the same thing."
195,KIM,195,Why does he have to stay here?
196,PEG,196,"Oh, my goodness, Kim. I'm surprised at you. He
can't help the way he is. Have a little
sympathy."
197,KIM,197,I do have a little sympathy.
198,PEG,198,"Then let's just say hello and later you can
come downstairs and shake his hand."
199,KIM,199,Shake his hand?
200,PEG,200,"Well, not literally. Goodness, you scared him
half to death."
201,KIM,201,I scared him to death?
202,PEG,202,"Hi, Bill. I just wanted you two to have a
proper introduction. Edward, this is our
daughter Kim.  Kim, this is Edward who's going
to live with us."
203,KIM,203,Hi!
204,JOYCE,204,Eddie. Thirsty?
205,JOYCE,205,"Kisses, Hush up. Quiet now. I can hardly hear
myself think. Momma's precious little baby
girl."
206,JOYCE,206,"Wouldn't you like a nice cool glass of
lemonade?"
207,EDWARD,207,Lemonade?
208,KEVIN,208,"One chop to guy's neck. And it's all over.
They're the sharpest things in the world. They
can hack through anything. And..."
209,KIM,209,"I think they look weird. They give me the
creeps."
210,A GIRL,210,"You should see the clown in front of Ms.
Peter's yard."
211,EDWARD,211,Kim!
212,KIM,212,"Oh, no!"
213,A GIRL,213,That's him?
214,JIM,214,"He's calling you, Kim."
215,KIM,215,Stop it.
216,A WOMAN,216,"Edward, you forgot your cookies."
217,JIM,217,"Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for you."
218,A GIRL,218,Let's go.
219,PEG,219,"Bill, you know what Edward told me? He had
lunch at Jackie's today."
220,BILL,220,Really?
221,PEG,221,She's just had her kitchen completely redone.
222,BILL,222,I'll be darned.
223,PEG,223,"New paint, new cabinets, new floors, new
microwave, new Sonnet dishwasher."
224,BILL,224,"Yeah, isn't that wonderful?"
225,PEG,225,"Isn't that something? Jim, didn't you tell me
your mom had her kitchen done too?"
226,JIM,226,"Yeah, my dad bought himself a bunch of new
toys. Big screen TV, CD players, VCR with four
heads."
227,PEG,227,"My goodness sake! I wonder what it's like to be
that rich."
228,JIM,228,"No, they keep things pretty much locked up. My
father has his own room for his stuff to make
sure I can't get and use it. He's so cheap he
won't help me buy my own car."
229,BILL,229,"Well, he probably wants you to pay for it
yourself. I agree with him. It builds
character. You'll appreciate it more. Speaking
of money, I understand you are not charging for
gardening, Edward?"
230,PEG,230,"Now, Bill. Margie made him cookies today."
231,BILL,231,"Sweetheart, you can't buy the necessities of
life with cookies. You can't buy car with
cookies. Am I right, Jim?"
232,JIM,232,"Ah, that's true, sir. You can't."
233,A GIRL,233,"I can't eat that. He used his hands. I don't
think it's sanitary."
234,EDWARD,234,I'm sorry.
235,PEG,235,"Honey, you want me to help you clean that up?"
236,KIM,236,"No, that's okay. I'll be right back."
237,HOUSEWIFE,237,This can't possibly be my Alexis.
238,HOUSEWIFE,238,"She looks so beautiful. Look at you. She's
gorgeous. Thank you."
239,PEG,239,"It won't be long. She has just to decide on the
style, and then it will be fine. She just has
to decide what style she wants."
240,JOYCE,240,"I was hoping for something big and bouffant.
Kind of like mine. Don't you worry , Kisses.
You'll be so pretty. Eddie, is there anything
you can't do? You take my breath away. I swear.
Look at this. Have you ever cut a woman's hair?
Would you cut mine? That was the single most
thrilling experience of my whole life."
241,PEG,241,We're getting the head of the company.
242,KIM,242,I'm home.
243,PEG,243,"Hi, honey. We're in here."
244,KIM,244,Hi! What did you do to your hair?
245,PEG,245,Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?
246,PEG,246,"Hello. Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you
in person. This is such an honor. Yes. He's
right here. Great. So then you know all about
it. Aha. That's exactly what I've been using.
Well, I've had a little trouble getting it to
the right consistency. Yeah, right. just a
little. I'll try that. Well, what imaginative
suggestions! I sure will. Thank you so much.
Bye bye."
247,PEG,247,"No wonder she's the head of the company. You
know, she started out as a sales representative
just like me. I've always wanted to talk to her
but until now I never had a reason. Thanks,
Edward."
248,EDWARD,248,She had some ideas?
249,PEG,249,You bet she did.
250,MARGIE,250,I'll get that.
251,MARGIE,251,"Edward! We're here. Come on. Let's get you
sharpened up."
252,JIM,252,You got it?
253,KIM,253,"No, I can't believe this."
254,KIM,254,Do you have a key?
255,EDWARD,255,No.
256,KIM,256,I could have sworn I put it in here somewhere.
257,JIM,257,"Well, we're stranded."
258,KIM,258,Wow! Thanks.
259,JIM,259,"Ed, what a guy! Good job. Hey, you didn't break
it or scratch it or anything. Hey, be a pal and
yell when Peg pulls in, huh?"
260,TV HOST,260,"Quite a story, yes? Any questions for Edward?
Yeah, get way over. Stand right up."
261,WOMAN 1,261,"What's been the best part of your new life here
in town?"
262,EDWARD,262,The friends I've made.
263,TV HOST,263,Any other questions?
264,WOMAN 2,264,"Have you ever thought of having corrective
surgery or prosthetics? I know a doctor that
might be able to help you."
265,EDWARD,265,I'd like to meet him.
266,TV HOST,266,"We'll give that name after the show. Thank you
very much. That's very nice. Anyone else? Yes,
stand right up."
267,WOMAN 3,267,"But if you had regular hands you'd be like
everyone else."
268,EDWARD,268,"Yes, I know."
269,TV HOST,269,I think he'd like that.
270,WOMAN 4,270,"Then no one would think you're special. You
wouldn't be on TV or anything."
271,PEG,271,"No matter what, Edward will always special."
272,TV HOST,272,More questions? Stand right up.
273,WOMAN 5,273,"Your work is so interesting distinctive and
unique. Do you have plans to open your own
beauty salon?"
274,TV HOST,274,There's an idea. Anyone else? Yeah.
275,WOMAN 6,275,Do you have a girl friend? Ahh.
276,JIM,276,"Sure, he does. Right, Kim?"
277,KIM,277,Now you got him started.
278,JIM,278,"Knock it off, bubble- butt."
279,KEVIN,279,You did it.
280,JIM,280,So?
281,TV HOST,281,"How about it? Is there some special lady in
your life?"
282,TV HOST,282,"Uh, everything's all right. He'll take a break
and we'll be right back after these messages."
283,KIM,283,Why are you laughing? He got hurt.
284,JIM,284,It was a little shock. Ha! Ha! Ha!
285,KIM,285,A little shock?
286,JIM,286,"I wish we'd been taping that. I'd give my left
nut to see that again."
287,JOYCE,287,"Aren't you excited? Oh, this is just so
thrilling. Wait till I show it to you. It's
just perfect. It's just what we've been looking
for. I want to call it ""Shear Heaven."" Here we
are. No, all along here I'm going to put a row
of new mirrors. Back up here a whole row of new
cosmetics."
288,JOYCE,288,All along this row here.
289,EDWARD,289,Peg could sell cosmetics.
290,JOYCE,290,"Sure. This is where I stand when I greet the
customers. Back in here is what I really want
to show you. This is the storeroom for
supplies. What I need from you today is to help
me make a decision. Don't, that's dangerous.
You just sit down right there. I have some
smocks. Would you like me to model them? This
is my favorite because it's yellow. And what
it's for is to catch itchy little trimming that
fall down your neck. Then there's this old
purple one, you know, you kind of drape around
you like this."
291,EDWARD,291,I like that one.
292,JOYCE,292,"You're trembling. So am I. I've been waiting
for this moment for so long. Edward! Edward,
you come back here! You can't do that!"
293,BILL,293,"Veloro. Veloro. Sweetheart. That hangs on the
dash board."
294,PEG,294,I've never seen that.
295,EDWARD,295,Sorry I'm late.
296,PEG,296,"Hi, Edward. Sorry. We had to go ahead without
you. Here you go."
297,BILL,297,"So, Edward, did you have a productive day?"
298,EDWARD,298,"Mrs. Monroe showed me where the salon is going
to be. You could have a cosmetic counter."
299,PEG,299,Wouldn't that be great?
300,BILL,300,Great.
301,EDWARD,301,"And then she showed me the back room where she
took all of her clothes off."
302,BILL,302,"Edward. I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I'm just as pleased as Punch. This whole beauty
parlor, that's what's going to teach you
volumes. There's nothing like running your own
business. I've never done it myself, but from
what I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a
working man can have. So I guess the bank is
going to be your next step, huh?"
303,EDWARD,303,The bank?
304,BILL,304,"Yeah, take out a loan. Get yourself started.
Nothing to worry about. With your talent and
reputation, it's going to be a snap. Now."
305,BANK CLERK,305,"No credit, no record of jobs you've held, no
savings, no personal investment, no social
security number. You may as well not even
exist. There is no collateral."
306,PEG,306,"You know. We already have a second on the
house, but don't the testimonials make a
difference?  Did you see here, the mayor's wife
can't wait to become a client?"
307,BANK CLERK,307,"We simply can't do it. Now get yourself a
social security card. Establish credit and buy
yourself a car. You have the side to advantage.
You can get one of those handicapped placards.
No problem. Park anywhere you like."
308,PEG,308,"I can't believe it. Really, it's just an
outrage. Don't you worry. This isn't the end of
it. We'll get your money somewhere."
309,KIM,309,But that's breaking and entering.
310,JIM,310,"Look. My parents have insurance up the rear.
Okay? And all it will cost them is a little
hassle. That's about it. In a week my dad will
have new and better everything."
311,KIM,311,We can't.
312,JIM,312,"Look. There's a guy who will give us cash for
the stuff."
313,KIM,313,"Jim, I don't want to."
314,JIM,314,"Well, do you want to ride around in a van like
Denny's, and we could be by ourselves whenever
we like? With a mattress in the back?"
315,KIM,315,Why can't you just do it?
316,JIM,316,"Because my father keeps the damn room locked,
and we need Edward to get us in."
317,KIM,317,"Why can't you take the key like when he's
sleeping or something?"
318,JIM,318,"Look, you don't understand, everything he
handcuffs or ties will do anything for you."
319,KIM,319,What do you mean?  That's not true.
320,JIM,320,"Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?"
321,KIM,321,That's not fair.
322,JIM,322,"What's fair got to do with it? There isn't any
other way."
323,KIM,323,There got to be.
324,JIM,324,"Look. I've racked my brain. Don't you want us
to have our own van?"
325,KIM,325,"Yeah.  Jim, the lights are on."
326,JIM,326,"Those go on automatically. They've gone for the
weekend. I told you. That's right."
327,DENNY,327,This burglar scared.
328,KIM,328,You turned off the alarm. Am I right?
329,JIM,329,"Yes, everything, come on. Let's go. Come on."
330,KIM,330,I can't believe this is happening.
331,A GIRL,331,"Are you sure he doesn't know this is Jim's
house?"
332,KIM,332,He's never been here.
333,EDWARD,333,This person stole from you?
334,JIM,334,"Keep your voice down. I told you he stole it.
Right? Come on. Let's go."
335,EDWARD,335,His parents will make him give it back.
336,JIM,336,"Listen, I've already tried that. The guy's
parents are like he is. Okay? Now, you told Kim
you'd do this. Well, come on. Let's go. Come
on. Come on. Come on."
337,JIM,337,The bastard had it wired separately. Come on.
338,KIM,338,"No, Jim. We can't just leave him here."
339,POLICEMAN,339,We know you're in there.
340,OFFICER ALLEN,340,"We're in the process of deactivating the system
so that you can come out."
341,KIM,341,"Denny, turn around!"
342,JIM,342,No way!
343,KIM,343,"Jim, it's your house. They can't arrest you for
setting off your own alarm. We'll just tell
them we were breaking in."
344,JIM,344,I'm not going back there. Okay?
345,KIM,345,We have to go back.
346,JIM,346,"No, because my father will prosecute."
347,KIM,347,His own son?
348,JIM,348,"Especially his own son. If Edward tells, I'll
kill him."
349,KIM,349,"Denny, turn around."
350,JIM,350,No.
351,KIM,351,Turn around. We have to.
352,OFFICER ALLEN,352,"Put your hands high in the air so we can see
them. Put your hands up!"
353,POLICEMAN,353,"He's got something in his hands. Looks like
knives."
354,OFFICER ALLEN,354,"Drop your weapon I repeat. Drop your weapon.
I'll ask you one more time and this is your
last warning. Drop your weapon. If you fail to
do so, we'll have to open fire. Don't make us
do that, please. Drop your weapons. Drop them.
Now. Looks like we got a psycho. Prepare to
fire."
355,A WOMAN,355,Please. We know him.
356,OFFICER ALLEN,356,"Alright, cuff him."
357,PEG,357,But can we see him now?
358,POLICEMAN,358,"We'll have to hold him overnight for
observation."
359,PEG,359,He has to stay in prison all night?
360,POLICEMAN,360,Pick him up in the morning.
361,PEG,361,"Oh, Edward. Hello Edward, dear. I blame myself."
362,BILL,362,"What in god's name was going through your mind,
son?"
363,PEG,363,"Why don't I set a better example? You saw how I
envied Jim's parents, their money."
364,BILL,364,What were you going to do with that stuff?
365,PEG,365,"Oh, I blithely say, ""We'll get money for the
salon somehow."" But I never meant stealing.
Stealing's not the way to get it. Stealing's
not the way to get anything."
366,BILL,366,Except trouble. And you're in a heap of that.
367,PEG,367,Why ever did you do this?
368,OFFICER ALLEN,368,"Will he be okay, Doc?"
369,PSYCHOLOGIST,369,"The years in spent isolation have not equipped
him with the tools necessary to judge right
from wrong. He's had no context. He's been
completely without guidance. Furthermore his
work, the garden sculptures, hair styles, and
so forth. Indicate that he's a highly
imaginative."
370,OFFICER ALLEN,370,Character.
371,PSYCHOLOGIST,371,"It seems clear that his awareness of what we
call reality is radically underdeveloped."
372,OFFICER ALLEN,372,But will he be all right out there?
373,PSYCHOLOGIST,373,"Oh, yeah. He'll be fine."
374,OFFICER ALLEN,374,"Listen. It could keep me up all night worrying
about you. Watch yourself."
375,MARGIE,375,I heard this noise and ran out in my bathrobe.
376,JOYCE,376,"All along I felt in my gut. There was something
wrong with him."
377,MARGIE,377,It could have been my house.
378,HELEN,378,It could have been any of our houses.
379,ESMERALDA,379,"I warned you, didn't I? I saw the sign of satan
on him.  You didn't heed my warning. but now
you will because now you see it too."
380,PEG,380,Edward. You stay here.
381,REPORTER,381,What do you say in your defense?
382,EDWARD,382,Nothing.
383,PEG,383,He didn't want to talk.
384,REPORTER,384,You have to say something.
385,PEG,385,He can't talk right now.
386,REPORTER,386,No comments? No remarks?
387,REPORTER,387,"So were you set up? What was going through your
mind? One comment."
388,PEG,388,"We have to get in the house. We don't want to
talk to you. We'll talk to you later."
389,REPORTER,389,One comment.
390,PEG,390,"Well, for goodness sakes, Lois, I'll see you at
our Christmas party. Before I get you here for
your haircut. Of course, we'll have it this
year. Why wouldn't we have it this year? Well,
you may think that, but you're wrong."
391,KIM,391,"You're here. They didn't hurt you, did they?
Were you scared? I tried to make Jim go back,
but you can't make Jim do anything. Thank you
for not telling them about me."
392,EDWARD,392,You are welcome.
393,KIM,393,"It must have been awful when they told you
whose house it was."
394,EDWARD,394,I know it was Jim's house.
395,KIM,395,You did?
396,EDWARD,396,Yes.
397,KIM,397,"Well, then why did you do it?"
398,EDWARD,398,Because you asked me to.
399,KIM,399,Don't.
400,JIM,400,"What's the matter with you? When you are going
to stop? I did what I could. My old man think
he's retarded, otherwise he'd still be in jail.
What more do you want from me?"
401,KIM,401,You could tell the truth.
402,JIM,402,"So could do. You were there, too."
403,KIM,403,"It wasn't my idea. You know I didn't want to do
it."
404,JIM,404,"But you did do it. I don't get why you give
such a shit anyway."
405,BILL,405,"Well, we are going to try to help you find a
way to replace the drapes and the towels, but
our confidence in you, Edward, is not going to
be so easy to replace."
406,KIM,406,Dad!
407,BILL,407,"Okay, a little ethics. You are walking down the
street. You find a suitcase full of money.
There's nobody around. No human person is in
evidence. What do you do? A
You keep the money. B
You use it to buy gifts for your friends and
your loved ones. C
You give it to the poor. D
You turn it into the police."
408,KIM,408,That is really stupid.
409,PEG,409,Kim!
410,KEVIN,410,I keep the money.
411,PEG,411,Simmer down.
412,BILL,412,Edward?
413,KIM,413,"Hey, how about after dinner we go down to the
bowling alley? That will be fun."
414,PEG,414,You are not seeing Jim tonight?
415,KIM,415,No.
416,KEVIN,416,"You know we had a cool show-and-tell today.
This kid brought in a box of baby possums, 10.
maybe 12. Totally naked. No hair at all."
417,PEG,417,"Honey, this is fascinating. but I don't think
your father's finished yet."
418,BILL,418,"Thank you, dear. Edward, we are waiting."
419,EDWARD,419,Give it to my loved ones?
420,PEG,420,"Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you
should do, bit it's not."
421,KEVIN,421,"You dope, everybody knows he's supposed to give
it to the police."
422,BILL,422,"Good thinking, Kevin."
423,KIM,423,"Well, think about it, you guys, I mean, that's
the nicer thing to do. That's what I would do."
424,BILL,424,"We're trying to make things easier for him, so
let's cut the comedy for a little while."
425,KIM,425,I am being serious. It's a nicer thing to do.
426,BILL,426,"We're not talking nice. We're talking right and
wrong."
427,KIM,427,Shut up.
428,PEG,428,"Oh, goodness sake, no wonder poor Edward can't
learn right from wrong living in his family."
429,WOMAN 1,429,Did you hear what he did to Peg's curtains?
430,MARGIE,430,"It is unbelievable that they're having their
Christmas party anyway. Are you going?"
431,WOMAN 1,431,"Oh, I don't think so."
432,MARGIE,432,"He practically raped Joyce, you know
threatening her with those knives? It's a
miracle she escaped."
433,HELEN,433,"I don't have anything against Bill and Peg,
but..."
434,JOYCE,434,"I know, I know. They've got that teenage
daughter in the house. Oh, those poor things
after what happened to me can you imagine?"
435,HELEN,435,"What do you say to Peg about the Christmas
party?"
436,MARGIE,436,I said I hoped. We'd make it.
437,HELEN,437,"I lied, too."
438,PEG,438,"Edward, do you want to give me that new
haircut?"
439,EDWARD,439,Again?
440,PEG,440,"yes, sure."
441,PEG,441,"It makes me proud to have you as my own
personal hairdresser."
442,KEVIN,442,"Hi, honey. honey."
443,EDWARD,443,"Kevin, you want to play scissors-paper-stone?"
444,KEVIN,444,No.
445,EDWARD,445,"No, why?"
446,KEVIN,446,It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.
447,PEG,447,Other people's feelings?
448,KEVIN,448,I'll be outside.
449,PEG,449,"A few manners? Just never you mind. Just you
cut away. Cut away. It needs something else.
What do you think, honey?"
450,KIM,450,More bells?
451,PEG,451,More bells. Okay.
452,KIM,452,"Mom, do you really think that we should be
having this party?"
453,PEG,453,"Of course I think we should be having this
party. Of course I do. I mean as just what we
need is just to calm things down and then
everything will just go back to normal. Do you
have any more bells, honey?"
454,JIM,454,"Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out! Go.
Freak!"
455,BILL,455,"Edward, where are you going?"
456,KIM,456,Where is he?
457,JIM,457,He tried to hurt you.
458,KIM,458,"No, he did not and you know it."
459,JIM,459,Are you nuts? I just saw him.
460,KIM,460,"Jim. I don't love you any more. I just want you
to go. Okay? Just go!"
461,JIM,461,"Are you serious? I'm going to lose you to that?
He isn't even human."
462,KIM,462,"Just get out of here. Okay? Just go! Dad, did
you see where Edward went?"
463,BILL,463,"Well. I don't know. He just walked down the
street."
464,KIM,464,"Well, we have to go find him, mom?"
465,PEG,465,You...your father will find him this minute.
466,BILL,466,"All in the house. I'll take care of it. I'll go
find him."
467,HELEN,467,Edward! I'm calling the police!
468,PEG,468,"All that blood, sweetie, and it's just a little
cut."
469,POLICE,469,"Hello, I'm here to see the man with the hands."
470,PEG,470,Oh... Uh...
471,POLICE,471,He's not here. Thank you.
472,PEG,472,"Oh, dear."
473,MARGIE,473,"Helen, did you actually see him?"
474,HELEN,474,"Yes, look."
475,ESMERALDA,475,"You see, I told you he was a demon."
476,MARGIE,476,"Oh, don't start that stuff again."
477,POLICE,477,I'm looking for the man with scissors.
478,WOMEN,478,"He went that way. You have to do something
about that."
479,POLICE,479,"All right, calm down, go on home. We'll handle.
Just go home."
480,HELEN,480,He's a de... a demon.
481,WOMEN,481,"You've got to do something! All right, Let's
see. If he's at our house come on, oh..."
482,PEG,482,I'm sure your father will find him soon.
483,KIM,483,What time is it?
484,PEG,484,"It's almost eight thirty. Great party, huh?"
485,KIM,485,Where are they? God. I hope he's okay!
486,PEG,486,"So do I, honey. You know, when I brought Edward
down here to live with us, I really didn't
think things through. And I didn't think about
what could happen to him, or to us, or to the
neighborhood. You know, I think that maybe it
might be best if he goes back up there. Because
at least there he's safe, and we'd just go back
to normal."
487,BILL,487,"Now I got up by the Wiggmans, but I didn't see
him anywhere."
488,PEG,488,"Oh, dear. Oh, just... Well, let's get in the
car and go look for him."
489,BILL,489,Where's Kevin now?
490,PEG,490,He's Max'es.
491,BILL,491,"Where do you think you're going, young lady?"
492,KIM,492,With you guys.
493,BILL,493,"No, you're staying here in case somebody shows
up!"
494,PEG,494,"We'll be right back, dear."
495,EDWARD,495,Police!
496,KIM,496,Edward?
497,EDWARD,497,Are you okay?
498,KIM,498,"Yes, are you okay?"
499,EDWARD,499,Where's everybody?
500,KIM,500,Out looking for you. Hold me.
501,EDWARD,501,I can't.
502,INVENTOR,502,"I know it's a little early for Christmas,
Edward, but I have a present for you."
503,JIM,503,"Forget holding her hand. Picture the damage he
could do other places."
504,JIM'S FRIEND,504,"Yeah, that's sick. I feel like I'm coming to
