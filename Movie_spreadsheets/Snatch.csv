12,TOMMY,12,"I am baking a cake Gorgeous, not
that i t ' s any of your business. Put
the takings down, and be a good chap."
13,TOMMY (CONT'D),13,"Is there anything else Gorgeous, a
cup of tea perhaps? No? Well in
that could you kindly fuck off and
shut the door behind you?"
14,TOMMY (CONT'D),14,"Not too bright but he hits like a
train. OK I ' l l take it. You're a
gambling man Boris, so I'll toss you

27,RUSSIAN,27,"Yes he's got it. He might call, he

28,BORIS,28,I' l l see what I can do.
29,RUSSIAN,29,"He can't know that it's you Boris.
We do too much business together.
You're gonna have to get someone
else to hit him and there is no way
it can relate to us. You understand?"
30,BORIS,30,Yes I understand.
31,RUSSIAN,31,"One more thing, he loves to gamble."
32,BRICK TOP,32,"Two hundred and sixty pounds, that's

36,GARY,36,"He'll kill him, he'll do you proud
governor."
37,BRICK TOP,37,"Do you reckon that's what people
should do for me, do you Gary, do me
proud?"
38,GARY,38,That's what you deserve Mr Mclean.
39,BRICK TOP,39,"Pull your tongue out of my arsehoie
Gary. Dogs do that, and you're not
a dog, are you Gary?"
40,GARY,40,"Err no, I am not."
41,BRICK TOP,41,"However, you do have all of the
characteristics of a dog Gary, all
except loyalty."
42,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),42,"And people like dogs Gary, for the
principal reason that they're loyal.
So I don't quite know where that
leaves you my old son, other than
refuckinpugnant. . ."
43,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),43,"Which one was it that kept the four
grand from the Clapham job?"
44,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),44,"Don't let me ask again. I would
like answers, but I am not in the
mood for asking questions, get busy
lads, or it's feeding time, oink,
oink, know what I mean?"
45,BRICK TOP (CONT'D'),45,"You know what to do with that don't
you Liam?"
46,HARRIS,46,Don't look for your sake.
47,BRICK TOP,47,"You're a ruthless cunt Liam, I' l l
give you that."
48,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),48,But I got no time for grasses.
49,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),49,Feed em to the pigs Errol.
50,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),50,"He's looking good, Bomber, is he
not? How's their man getting on?"
51,TOMMY,51,Is he allowed to do that?
52,TURKISH,52,"It's an unlicensed boxing match Tommy,
not a tickling competition. These
lads are out to hurt each other."
53,GORGEOUS GEORGE,53,"Oi Turkish, can I have a drink?"
54,TURKISH,54,"What do I look like to you George, a
fuckin water boy?"
55,TURKISH (CONT'D),55,"Oi son, look lively."
56,TURKISH (CONT'D),56,Look at it.
57,TURKISH (CONT'D),57,"How am I supposed to run this thing
from that? We gonna need a proper
office."
58,TURKISH (CONT'D),58,"I want a new one Tommy and you 're
going to buy it for me."
59,TOMMY,59,What's wrong with this one?
60,TURKISH,60,"Oh nothing Tommy, it's tip top, it's
just I am not sure about the colour."
61,TURKISH (CONT'D),61,"Here it's all arranged. You just
gotta pick it up. Here's an address."
62,TOMMY,62,I t ' s that campsite.
63,TURKISH,63,"That's right, you're buying a caravan,
caravans live in campsites."
64,TOMMY,64,They aren't pikey are they?
65,TURKISH,65,"I don't know what they are, all I
know is they have a caravan, and we
want a Caravan."
66,TOMMY,66,"I hope they're not pikies.     I hate
fucking pikies."
67,TURKISH,67,"You're a sensitive boy, ain't you
Tommy? You got ten grand and I want
to see change."
68,TURKISH (CONT'D),68,"Fuck me, hold tight, what's that?"
69,TOMMY,69,"It's my Gucci belt, Turkish."
70,TURKISH,70,"No Tommy, there's a gun in your
trousers. What is a gun doing in
your trousers?"
71,TOMMY,71,It's for protection.
72,TURKISH,72,"Protection from what, the Germans?
The war ended fifty years ago. Err
what's to stop it blowing your balls
off every time you sit down? Where
did you get it?"
73,TOMMY,73,Boris the Blade.
74,TURKISH,74,"You mean Boris the sneaky fucking
Russian."
75,TURKISH (CONT'D),75,I t ' s a bit heavy isn't it?
76,BORIS,76,"The weight is a sign of reliability.
I always go for reliability."

for -it?"
78,BORIS,78,Nothing.
79,FRANKY FOUR FINGERS,79,"Ok, so what do you want for it?"

81,BORIS (CONT'D),81,There is a fight in a couple of days:
82,FRANKY FOUR FINGERS,82,What kind of a fight?
83,BORIS,83,Unlicensed boxing.
84,BORIS (CONT'D),84,"There is a bookies I know that will
take bets. If you place one down
for me we will call it quits."
85,FRANKY FOUR FINGERS,85,Why don't you put it down yourself?
86,BORIS,86,"Well there isn't too many bookies
that take those kind of bets, and I
already have an outstanding debt
with the house. I know something
most don't. Why don't you put a few
pounds down yourself?"
87,FRANKY FOUR FINGERS,87,What do you mean?              ·
88,HANDS,88,Play the game Doug.
89,HANDS,89,"I am playing the game Hands. That's
what I ' l l give ya."
90,HANDS,90,"You gotta haggle fairly Doug,
otherwise it'll make your hair fall
out you'll see.                              ."
91,DOUG,91,You know I won't buy poop.
92,HANDS,92,He isn't selling poop.
93,DOUG,93,"Listen if the stones are kosher then
I'll by em. Now I gotta business, to
run."
94,DOUG (CONT'D),94,"That was my cousin Hands, Have I
told you about my cousin Hands?"
95,ALEX,95,"Yes Dad, you have."
96,DOUG,96,He's an important fella.
97,"SUSI,   .        .",97,"Yes Dad, you told us."
98,ALE X,98,"Is that a prawn sandwich you're
eating?"
99,DOUG,99,Is it?
100,ALEX,100,You're Jewish Dad.
101,DOUG,101,Yes.     I was last time·I looked.
102,ALEX,102,"Well you can't eat shell fish, Dad,
i t ' s against your persuasion."
103,DOUG,103,"What persuasion myself or the prawns
belongs to is not the issue, the
issue is how a fuckin shrimp managed
to sneak in to' my sandwich."
104,DOUG (CONT'D),104,Sneaky bastards.
105,VINNY,105,"Move it, come on move"" i t ."
106,VINNY,106,"Alright Sol, Lincoln."
107,B AD BOY LINCOLN,107,Vin.
108,SOL,108,It's a mosinite.
109,BAD BOY LINCOLN,109,A whatinnite?
110,SOL,110,"No, a mosinite."
111,BAD BOY LINCOLN,111,How much a night?
112,SOL,112,"No, a fuckin mosinite.            It's the
updated zirconia."
113,BAD BOY LINCOLN,113,"Enough of bosinites and mosonias,
talk English to me Sol?"
114,SOL,114,"Zirconias are artificial diamonds,
they look pretty good to the novice
like you Lincoln. But you could
break them with a hammer, so they
came up with mosinites."
115,BAD BOY LINCOLN,115,What are you saying?
116,SOL,116,I am saying it's worth fuck all.
117,BAD BOY LINCOLN,117,Fuck what?
118,.SOL,118,"I t ' s worth more than fuck what, but

that Vince?. You can't bring that
thing in here."
124,VINNY,124,"It's in here, what's the problem,
it's only a dog."
125,SOL,125,"I know full fucking well what it is
Vin. Where did you get it?"
126,VINNY,126,"Those gypsies, they threw it in with
a load of moody gold."
127,SOL,127,It better not be dangerous.
128,VINNY,128,Does it look dangerous?
129,SOL,129,"Yes, it fucking does Vin.          If it so
much as farts it's out."
130,VINNY,130,If it farts we'll all be out.
131,VINNY (CONT'D),131,"Jesus, where did you come from?"
132,BORIS,132,Uzbekistan.
133,VINNY,133,"Oi Sol, Boris is here."
134,SOL,134,"Boris, what's up?"
135,BORIS,135,I have a job for you.
136,SOL,136,Go on.
137,BORIS,137,I want you to hold up a bookies.
138,SOL,138,"How high do you want us to hold it?
Steady on George. We deal in
jewellery Boris, we don't hold up
bookies."
139,BORIS,139,Hear me out.     This one is different.
140,TOMMY,140,"Don't you worry Gorgeous, he's a big
man granted but you gotta bigger
punch than Judy."
141,GORGEOUS GEORGE,141,Jesus what's that?
142,TOMMY,142,That's what we are looking for.
143,GORGEOUS GEORGE,143,"I t ' s a camp site. It's a pikey
campsite."
144,TOMMY,144,Ten points.
145,GORGEOUS GEORGE,145,What are we doing here?
146,TOMMY,146,We are buying a caravan.
147,GORGEOUS GEORGE,147,"Off a pack of fucking pikies? What's
wrong with you? This'll get messy."
148,TOMMY,148,Not if you're here.
149,GORGE OUS GEORGE,149,"Oh fuck off Tommy you never said
anything about pikies."
150,TOMMY,150,"Calm down, we are buying and then we
are off."
151,GORGEOUS GEORGE,151,"Oh you bastard, I hate fuckin pikies."
152,KID 1,152,That's a flash car Mister.
153,TOMMY,153,"Not as flash as your bike though is
it?"
154,KID 1,154,Who you looking for?
155,TOMMY,155,Mr O'Neill.
156,KID 1,156,Do you want me to go and get him?
157,TOMMY,157,Good lad.
158,TOMMY (CONT'D),158,"Well are you going to go and get
him?"
159,KID 1,159,Yeah.
160,TOMMY,160,Well what are you waiting for?
161,KID 1,161,"The five quid you are going to pay
me."
162,TOMMY,162,"Oh fuck off, I'll find him myself."
163,KID 1,163,Two fifty.
164,TOMMY,164,You can have a quid.
165,KID 1,165,Oh you're a tight fucker aren't ya?
166,MIC KY,166,"What are you doing Paul? Get out of
the way boy. Are you Tommy, have
you come about the caravan?"
167,TOMMY,167,Mr O'Neill?
168,MICKY,168,"Fuck man, call me Micky."
169,TOMMY,169,How are ya?
170,MICKY,170,"I am well sir, well, quite well, the
weather is being kind to us but the
engines aren't."
171,MICKY (CONT'D),171,"Fuck me, would you look at the size
of him, Jesus man how big are you?
Hey kids how fucking big is he?"
172,KID 2,172,He's a big man that's for sure.
173,MICKY,173,"Would you look at the size of his
muscles? And then look at the size
of his fists. Hey Mum, come and
look at the size of this fella."
174,MICKY (CONT'D),174,"Would you look at the strength of
the man? I bet you can box a little
can't you sir? You look like a boxer."
175,MUM,175,"Get out of the way Micky and see if
the fellas would like a drink."
176,TOMMY,176,I could murder one.
177,MUM,177,"There won't be any murdering done
around here, I don't mind telling
ya."
178,MICKY,178,"Would the big fella like a cup of
tea?"
179,MUM,179,"Don't be silly Micky, a man didn't
get that size from drinking cups of
tea. Offer the man a Guiness boy."
180,KID 2,180,Lift me up would you Mister?
181,KID 3,181,"I bet you can't lift us both at the
same time."
182,MICKY,182,"Good dogs, do you like dogs?"
183,TOMMY,183,"Sure, yeah, I like dogs.   I like
caravans more."
184,TYRONE,184,"I don't want him dribbling on my             ,
seats man."
185,SOL,185,"Give him another of those biscuits.
They shut him up."
186,VINNY,186,They give him wind.
187,VINNY (CONT'D),187,"Hey watch the road! Fuck me, you
want this man to drive us Sol? Can
you drive mate?"
188,SOL,188,"No Vin, he can't tell the difference
between a steering wheel and a man
. on the moon. That' s why I got him."
189,TYRONE,189,"Don't you worry about me, jus worry
about the dog on my seats man!"
190,VINNY,190,"Sol why's he talking like a black
man?"
191,SOL,191,"I don't know Vin. Oi Tyrone, Vin
wants to know why you talk like a
black man?"
192,TYRONE,192,"Roots and ting, seen?"
193,VINNY,193,Roots and what?
194,SOL,194,"I don't know. You get that gun from
Boris?"
195,VINNY,195,"Got it. It wasn't exactly what I
was expecting, mind. Mean looking
bastard though, that's for sure."
196,SOL,196,What's that?
197,VINNY,197,It's a shotgun Sol.
198,SOL,198,"I t ' s a fuckin anti-aircraft gun Vin.
What are you planning on shooting,
the angels out of the clouds? That's
gonna raise more than pulses."
199,VINNY,199,It will raise hell my old son.
200,SOL,200,"I don't think I really want to see
· hell Vin. What's wrong with a normal
gun?"
201,VINNY,201,"The are psychological advantages to
a gun that looks like it can perforate
the moon."
202,SOL,202,"Can you get this fuckin dog to stop
dribbling on me?"
203,SOL (CONT'D),203,"I worry about you Vin, Jesus, talk
about overkill. One look at a crack
desperate brother and you could wave
a knife and fork around, and I am
sure they would lick the salt of
your scrotum."
204,VINNY,204,What the fuck are you doing?
205,TYRONE,205,"I never do a job unless I have a
clean car, I like to make my wheels
look crisp."
206,VINNY,206,"Are you serious,? You' re a getaway
driver, you're not here to show your
fuckin car off.               ··."
207,MICKY,207,"He's a good dog. He'll get a little
homesick for a while but he'11 get
over it."
208,TOMMY,208,"I don't know what all your fuss was
about. They aren't bad fellas."
209,. GORGEOUS GEORGE,209,"I don't think it's supposed to have
done that."
210,MICKY,210,"The deal was you bought it how you
saw it."
211,MICKY (CONT'D),211,"Look, I have helped ya as much as I
am gonna help ya. You still got a
car and I suggest you use it before
you're not welcome anymore."
212,GORGEOUS GEORGE,212,Hey...
213,MICKY,213,"It was only a question of time before
you got some attention. Nobody brings
a fella the size of you unless they
are trying to say something without
talking."
214,TOMMY,214,"Just give us my money and you can
keep your caravan."
215,MICKY,215,"Why the fuck do I want a caravan
that's got no fuckin wheels? I am
not going to do that."
216,MICKY (CONT'D),216,"Where the fuck do you think you're
going? You want to settle this with
a fight?"
217,MUM,217,"You'll do no such thing Michael.
You'll..."
218,MICKY,218,"Alright Mum, we shan't, we'll settle
it some other way, now don't get
upset."
219,MUM,219,"I won't have you fighting, Micky."
220,MICKY,220,Okay mum okay. You need to sit down.
221,MICKY (CONT'D),221,"Darren look after Mum. Get her
sitting down."
222,MICKY (CONT'D),222,I ' l l fight you for it.
223,GORGEOUS GEORGE,223,"You want to stay down my friend, I
promise you, you want to stay down."
224,GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONT'D),224,"Now you fucking stay down boy or you
won't be coming up next time."
225,GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONT'D),225,This is sick. I am outta here.
226,MICKY -,226,"You're not going anywhere my friend.
You stay until the job is done."
227,TOMMY (V.O.),227,"This isn't good, if George doesn't
wake up in the next few minutes I"
228,TOMMY ( V . O . ) (CONT'D),228,"have a problem. I am scared, really
fuckin scared. There is something
coldblooded and practical about what
these people are thinking. They
will pop me like a hot sausage if
George doesn't wake up. Why do they
want to go to the trouble of
explaining why a man died in a
campsite? These people don't exist
in society, you can't find them,
they live under their own laws and
ignore everybody else's. I am scared,
I am really fuckin scared."
229,.TURKISH,229,"So you're telling me he would have
run you through if Gorgeous hadn't
woken up?"
230,TOMMY,230,"No, his Mum stopped it. If his Mum
hadn't turned up, well, I ' d be pikey
fuckin sausages."
231,TURKISH,231,"What were you thinking of? Why the
fuck did you put Gorgeous George
into a bare knuckle boxing match two
days before he had to fight the
Bomber?"
232,TOMMY,232,He was half his size.
233,TOMMY (CONT'D),233,I didn't expect him to get hurt.
234,TURKISH,234,"You put the man into a bare knuckle
boxing match."
235,TURKISH (CONT'D),235,"What the fuck did you expect? A
grease down and a shiatsu?"
236,TOMMY,236,Who took the jam out of your donut?
237,TURKISH,237,"You took the fuckin jam out of my
donut Tommy, you did."
238,TOMMY,238,You said get a good deal so...
239,TURKISH,239,"Tell me the correlation between a
hospitalized boxer and a good deal?"
240,TURKISH (CONT'D),240,"How are we going to explain to Brick
Top that his fight isn't going to              .
happen?"
241,TOMMY,241,We replace the fighter.
242,TURKISH,242,"Oh what, and hope he doesn't notice?
And who the fuck are we going to
replace him with?"
243,TOMMY,243,"John ""The Gun?"" Or ""Mad Fist"" Willy?"
244,TURKISH,244,"You're not exactly Mr Current Affairs,
are you Tommy? Mad Fist went mad,
and the ""Gun"" shot himself."
245,TOMMY,245,What about Clam Hand Tony?
246,TURKISH,246,"Got his fingers caught in the till.
He's no good to anyone."
247,TOMMY,247,Why not?
248,TURKISH,248,"A bare .knuckle boxer isn't a lot of
good without any fuckin knuckles,
Tommy."
249,TURKISH (CONT'D),249,Jesus!
250,TOMMY,250,What?
251,TURKISH,251,Let's use the fuckin pikey.
252,FRANKY FOUR FINGERS,252,"From Russia with love. You
interested?                                ."
253,DOUG,253,I told you I was interested.
254,FRANKY FOUR FINGERS,254,"I got stones to sell, fat to chew
and many different men to see about
many different dogs, so if I am not
rushing you, could you spit shine
the top of your smoothie and move a
little faster?"
255,DOUG,255,"Hold tight Franky, when in Rome."
256,FRANKY FOUR FINGERS,256,"I am not in Rome Doug, I am in a
rush."
257,FRANKY FOUR FINGERS (CONT'D),257,I gotta make the bookies.
258,DOUG,258,Bookies? What you betting on?
259,FRANKY FOUR FINGERS,259,Some guy called Bomber Harris.
260,DOUG,260,"The unlicensed boxer? You know
something I don't?"
261,FRANKY FOUR FINGERS,261,Maybe.
262,DOUG,262,"You get busy Franky. Put a couple

mother. But I am seeing him later."
276,HANDS,276,When?
277,DOUG,277,"He wants cash so he's coming back
after he has been to a fight."
278,HANDS,278,"What do you mean a fight, you mean a
boxing match? Is there gambling
involved?"
279,DOUG,279,I t ' s a boxing match Hands.

282,HANDS,282,"And he's gone gambling? That's Franky
""I have a problem with gambling""
fuckin Four Fingers, you are talking
about Doug."
283,DOUG,283,"What am I, telepathic?"
284,HANDS,284,"Franky is good at buying stones Doug
but he's a fuckin liability when it
comes to gambling. That has cost
me. So in turn rit' s cost him. He
gets distracted and chopping off a
digit seems to focus his attention."
285,DOUG,285,How much can he lose?
286,HANDS,286,"I ' l l not forgive you Doug, I am coming
over, get me that car."
287,TURKISH,287,We are here to see Brick Top.

294,TURKISH (CONT'D),294,"You know what he's done to people on
that pool table?"
295,TOMMY,295,"What, potted more balls than any
other player? What else can you do
to people on a pool table?"
296,TURKISH,296,"Quite a fuckin lot if you nail 'em

308,BRICK TOP,308,I said keep the noise down.. . .
309,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),309,"Well, where did you lose him? He

he? And it's not as though he is
inconfuckinspicuous is it?"
310,TURKISH,310,I am not backing out.
311,BRICK TOP,311,"You can bet your bollocks to a barn
dance you're not backing out."
312,TOMMY,312,We are changing the fighter.
313,BRICK TOP,313,"Oh fuck me your lady friend has got
a voice. And who might you be
changing him to, sweetheart?"
314,TURKISH,314,You won't know him.
315,BRICK TOP,315,Are you taking the piss?
316,TURKISH,316,"No, there was an accident."
317,BRICK TOP,317,I'll show you a fuckin accident.
318,TURKISH,318,You've still got your fight.
319,BRICK TOP,319,"No, I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters at the
last minute, so no, I don't have my
fight do I, you fuckin prat!"
320,TOMMY,320,You could take bets at the fight.
321,BRICK TOP,321,"Put a lead on her Turkish,     Before
she gets bitten."
322,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),322,"Make sure your man goes down in the
fourth. You're on thin fuckin ice
my pedigree chums and I'll be there
if it breaks."
323,SOL,323,"I am not happy about that dog Vin,
you can't bring a dog on a job."
324,VINNY,324,"You can't leave him on his own, not
to begin with, he gets homesick."
325,SOL,325,"Homesick, for fucks sake."
326,VINNY,326,"He does. If he gets the chance he
runs back to the gypsies' campsite."
327,SOL,327,"Ohh shut up, how can he find it?"
328,VINNY,328,"I don't know Sol, I am not a dog.
Ask him. It' s like he's got a fuckin
homing beacon. Give him the chance
and he's off."
329,SOL,329,"You're going soft Vin? Here pass me
a sandwich."
330,SOL (CONT'D),330,"Jessssus, he didn't even chew it."
331,VINNY,331,"What have you stopped here for?
What's wrong with that space?"
332,TYRONE,332,It's too tight.
333,VINNY,333,"What are you talking about, tight?
You could land a jumbo fuckin jet in
there."
334,SOL,334,"Leave him alone, he's a natural."
335,VINNY,335,"A natural fuckin idiot.    Tyrone,
what have you done?"
336,TYRONE,336,"Look, you hassle me, see what happens."
337,VINNY,337,"Well don't move it now, otherwise
people will see the damage. What
did you do that for?                        ^"
338,TYRONE,338,I didn't see it there.
339,VINNY,339,"Eh? It's a four ton truck. It' s
not as though i t ' s a ferret fuckin a
flea is it?"
340,TYRONE,340,It was at a funny angle.
341,VINNY,341,"Funny angle? It was behind you
Tyrone, whenever you reverse things
come from behind you. I am not happy
Sol."
342,VINNY (CONT'D),342,Give him something to shut him up.
343,SOL,343,He can't swallow a whole ball.
344,TYRONE,344,He swallowed it.
345,DOUG,345,Did you get Hands that car?
346,ALEX,346,I got him one like it.
347,DOUG,347,What do you mean one like it?
348,ALEX,348,I got him the Volante.
349,DOUG,349,"What did I say? What exactly did I
say?"
350,ALEX,350,You said get him the Vantage.
351,DOUG,351,"That's right, I clearly said get him
the Vantage. So why did you get the
Volante?                                      ;"
352,ALEX,352,Because they look the same.
353,DOUG,353,"The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for ""young woman"" in
to the Greek word for ""virgin"",
because they thought they looked the
same, coming up with the prophecy
""behold a virgin shall conceive and
bear a son"". But there is a world
of difference between a virgin and a
young woman like there is between a
Volante and a fuckin Vantage."
354,ALEX,354,"Are you saying that the fact that
your cousin Hands is driving a Valiant
instead of a Vantage is a profound a
mistake as a whole religion?"
355,DOUG,355,Yes I fuckin am!
356,DOUG (CONT'D),356,"Cars are his religion. He can drive
a Valiant in the States but I can't
drive a Vantage because they won't
tolerate the emissions. Well, it's
too late now, that's Concorde."
357,DOUG,357,"How about a hug for your old cousin
Doug?"
358,· HANDS,358,"Fuck off you fat bald bastard - and
where's my car?"
359,VINNY,359,How am I going to get it out?
360,SOL,360,He'll probably cough it up.
361,VINNY,361,Do you think he'll be alright?
362,SOL,362,Hope not.
363,TYRONE,363,What are we waiting for?
364,SOL,364,"We are waiting for a man carrying a
case."
365,TYRONE,365,Why?
366,SOL,366,"Because the deal is that we give the
Russian the case and we keep the
money."
367,TYRONE,367,What's in the case?
368,SOL,368,"Fuckin 'ell Tyrone you ask a lot of
questions. You concentrate on the
driving okay?"
369,SOL (CONT'D),369,"Shit, was that him?"
370,.'               VINNY,370,"Don't ask me, you're the one supposed
to keep an eye on it. How many
fingers did he have?"
371,SOL,371,"Are you serious? I am sorry but I
couldn't get the binoculars out in
time."
372,VINNY,372,"Well let's not stand on ceremony,
let's start the show."
373,PAULINE,373,"Yes sir, how can I help?"
374,VINNY,374,"You can start by giving me all your
money."
375,PAULINE,375,"Does Sir know who this bookies belongs
to?"
376,VINNY,376,It. belongs to me now.
377,VINNY (CONT'D),377,If you know what's good for...

the fuck are you doing up there?"
380,SOL (CONT'D),380,"I have got your man out here. If
you don't put down the screen I'll
blow his fucking head off! You hear
me?"
381,PAULINE ( O . S . ),381,"I don't care, you can do what you
like he's not related to me."
382,SOL,382,You think you can try me?
383,SOL,383,"Drop the screen now! You just seen
what it did to this wall so think
what it could do to you."
384,PAULINE,384,. Do it. . . . I said do it.
385,SOL,385,How you doing Vince?
386,VINNY,386,"How do I look like I am doing you
fucking idiot? I would be doing a
lot better if you would stop using
my name."

if the fuckin bets are off. I want..."
392,PAULINE,392,"If all bets are off then there can't
be any money, can there?"
393,SOL,393,I ain't buying that.
394,PAULINE,394,"I ain't fuckin selling it, it's a
fact!                                         . ''."

396,PAULINE,396,"Nothing, I mean we got a few coins
but no notes."
397,VINNY,397,"Can we just get out of here please.
I am not feeling too funny."

funny myself, let me tell you!"

513,MUM,513,They're very nice Tommy.       Thank you.
514,TURKISH,514,"Where did they come from? You're a
snake in the grass Tommy."

516,TURKISH,516,'Do you know where I can find him?
517,MUM,517,Yes.
518,TURKISH,518,"Well would you like to share that
information with me Ms O'Neill?"
519,MUM,519,"I don't want you getting my boy in
to any trouble you hear me? He's my
only boy and he's a good boy."
520,M UM (CONT'D),520,"He's coursing, he's a couple of fields
that way."
521,TOMMY,521,What's coursing?
522,TURKISH,522,"Hare coursing. The gypsies can't
get enough of it."
523,TOMMY,523,What the fuck's a hare?
524,TURKISH,524,I t ' s a big rabbit.
525,TOMMY,525,"Why don't they call em big rabbits
then?"
526,TURKISH,526,Because they call em hares.
527,TOMMY,527,So what's coursing?
528,TURKISH,528,"They set two lurchers, they are dogs
before you ask, on a hare, that's
the big rabbit. And the hare has to
outrun the dogs."
529,TOMMY,529,What happens if he doesn't?
530,TURKISH,530,"Well the big rabbit gets fucked
doesn't it?"
531,TOMMY,531,"Come on, what, proper fucked?"
532,TURKISH,532,"Yeah before the Germans get there
Tommy. How can a dog fuck a
rabbit?...eh? If eats the bastard."

534,ERROL (CONT'D),534,Cheers pal.
535,MULLET,535,"Errol, John. Alright chaps?     How's
the gov'nor?"
536,ERROL,536,"Very well Mullet, I am sure he'll be
flattered you inquired."
537,MULLET,537,Yeah let him know that I asked.
538,JOHN,538,"We'll be sure to. Now come on Mullet
what have you got for us about the
gov'nor's bookies?"
539,MULLET,539,"I did find something out as it
happens, I knew a driver who was
grafting that day."
540,ERROL,540,Don't stop with the foreplay.
541,MULLET,541,"White geezer, bit of a bounty."
542,EROL,542,Eh?
543,MULLET,543,"Bounty, black on the outside, white
on the inside."
544,JOHN,544,Go on.
545,MULLET,545,"He was doing a job for a couple of
brothers in Smith Street. I think
it was a pawn shop."
546,JOHN,546,Porn as in filthy dirty?
547,MULLET,547,"Pawn as in I have run out of money
and here's my wedding ring."
548,ERROL,548,Good boy Mullet.
549,TURKISH,549,Well do you want to do it?
550,MICKY,550,That depends.
551,TURKISH,551,On what?
552,MICKY,552,On you buying this caravan.
553,TURKISH,553,That's not the same caravan.
554,MICKY,554,This isn't the same fight.
555,TURKISH,555,"I t ' s twice the fuckin size of the
last one."
556,MICKY,556,"The fight is twice the size. And my
mum still needs a new caravan."
557,TURKISH,557,"Micky you are lucky we aren't worm
food after your performance, I think
buying a tart's mobile palace is a
little fuckin rich."
558,TURKISH (CONT'D),558,"I didn't mean that your mum was a
tart. I just meant..."
559,MICKY,559,"Save your breath for cooling your
porridge. I'll bet you for it."
560,TURKISH,560,"What like Tommy did last time? Do
me a favour?"
561,MICKY,561,"I ' l l do you a favour, you have first     ,
bet. If I win I get the caravan, if
I lose I'l l do the fight for free."
562,TURKISH,562,"Okay, I reckon the hare gets caught."
563,TYRONE,563,"Ok, I'll fuckin tell you."
564,TOMMY,564,"You're are as mad as mars you are,
why did you take that bet? What
happens now?"
565,TURKISH,565,We buy him a caravan Tommy.
566,TOMMY,566,"There is something very wrong with
this, it was us that wanted to buy a
caravan off him."
567,TURKISH,567,"Why didn't you ""bus a cap in his
ass"" then Tommy? Mind you, you would
do more damage if you threw it at
him."
568,TOMMY,568,You saying I can't shoot?
569,TURKISH,569,"Oh no Tommy I wasn't saying you can't
shoot, I know you can't shoot. What
I was saying is that six pound piece
of shit stuck in your trousers there
would do more damage if you fed it
to em."
570,TOMMY,570,Are you saying it doesn't work?
571,TURKISH,571,You tried it?
572,TURKISH-(CONT'D),572,"work for the faces, and I don't want
to be the one that breaks it to you
Tommy but you ain't a face. Go on
try it."
573,TURKISH (CONT'D),573,Whoops.
574,TOMMY,574,"I want to see that sneaky fuckin
Russian."
575,BAD BOY LINCOLN,575,What happened to him?
576,SOL,576,"He got shot in the face Lincoln, I
would have thought that was obvious."
577,BA D BOY LINCOLN,577,"Well what do you want me to do about
it?"
578,SOL,578,Sort it out.
579,BAD BOY LINCOLN,579,"The only way to sort it out is to
bring him back to life and I am not
a fuckin witch doctor am I?"
580,SOL,580,"Villains are supposed to know how to
get rid of bodies."
581,BAD BOY LINCOLN,581,"Err, yes, but I have never actually
got rid of one. Who is he?"
582,SOL,582,"He's a man with a hole in his face
Lincoln. Who cares who he is?"
583,BAD BOY LINCOLN,583,"Err well, let's wrap him up."
584,SOL,584,"What do you want to do that for?
, He's not a fuckin Christmas present."
585,BRICK TOP,585,"Like I said I wasn't giving you a
choice. I am telling you that fuckin
gypsy has got to fight."
586,TURKISH,586,"I am sorry, but he's a stubborn
bastard, he says he's had enough, he
says he's got to look after his old
mum."
587,BRICK TOP,587,His what?                  ·.-·                     . ..
588,TURKISH                          ',588,His mum.
589,BRICK TOP,589,Are' you taking the piss again?
590,TURKISH,590,"That's what he said, she's a nice
old girl his mum."
591,BRICK TOP,591,"You're on thin ice Turkish, and I am
going to be there when it breaks."
592,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),592,"Anything for an easy life. That
fuckin pikey being difficult. Hello,

I wouldn't miss it for the world."
595,ERROL,595,Get the governor John.
596,JOHN,596,It looks like we are in gov.
597,BRICK TOP,597,"Oh goodie gum drops. Get us a cup
of tea would you Errol?"
598,SOL,598,Hold him by his legs.
599,BA D BOY LINCOLN,599,"What do you think I am holding him
by, his fucking ears?"
600,BRICK TOP,600,Hope it ' s not a bad moment.
601,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),601,Do you know who I am?
602,BAD BOY LINCOLN,602,Yeah I know.
603,BRICK TOP,603,"Good.   That will save me some time
then."
604,VINNY,604,Well I don't.
605,BRICK TOP,605,"What you gonna do with your man there?
You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.
Apparently the best thing to do is
cut the corpse up into six pieces
and pile it all together."
606,SOL,606,"Would someone mind telling me who
you are?"
607,BRICK TOP,607,"After you got six pieces you gotta
get rid of 'em, of course you can't
just leave it in the deep freeze for
your mum to discover, can ya?"
608,VINNY,608,"Lincoln, who is this man?"
609,BRICK TOP,609,"And then I hear the best thing to do
is feed 'em to pigs. You gotta starve
the pigs for a few days, then the
sight of a chopped up body looks
like curry to a drunk. You gotta
shave the heads of your victims and
pull the teeth out, you could do
that after of course, but you don't
want to go sieving pig shit do you?
Ever seen the size of one of their
molars?                                        ·"
610,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),610,"They go through bone like i t ' s butter.
You gotta have a few pigs though you
need about sixteen they will go
through a body that weighs two hundred
pounds in about eight minutes that
means that a single pig can consume
two pounds of uncooked flesh every
minute,. . ."
611,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),611,"Hence the expression greedy as a
pig."
612,VINNY,612,"Well thank you, that's a large weight
off my mind."
613,VINNY (CONT'D),613,"But would you mind very much telling
me who the' fuck you are? Other than
a man that feeds people to pigs of
course."
614,JOHN,614,Would you look at the size of this?
615,BRICK TOP,615,Golly that is big isn't it Errol?
616,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),616,Do you know what Nemesis means?
617,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),617,"A righteous infliction of retribution
·by. an appropriate agent, personified
in this case by a horrible cunt.

630,SOL,630,"Mr Mclean I kid you not. Why do you
think we have a dead man, missing an
arm in our office? Give us four
days and we'11 bring you a stone the
size of a home."
631,BRICK TOP,631,What do you think Errol?
632,ERROL.,632,"I think we should drip dry em
governor, while we have the chance."
633,BRICK TOP,633,"It was a rhetorical question Errol,
what have I told you about thinking?"
634,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),634,You got forty eight hours.
635,BRICK TOP (CONT'D),635,I am going to take your man here.

didn't want to do it."

you get round to-the Russian's. The
second you see him call us."

784,HANDS,784,I wouldn't know what to do with it.
785,BTT,785,"It's not a fuckin rocket launcher.

roses, how the fuck do you think I

dangerous bastard, taken too many
disco biscuits in the heat of Russian
disputations, he's got as many of
these nuts as those nuts."
807,TOMMY,807,"I don't care if he's got fuckin hazel
nuts, I want a gun that works."
808,TURKISH,808,"Well come on then before the Germans

I am number one, Vin number two and
you are number three."
812,SOL,812,"I don't want a fuss and I don't want
to put a bullet in your face, but
unless you give me exactly what I
want there will be murders."
813,SOL (CONT'D),813,Number three pull the blind down.
814,VINNY,814,"lo number three, he said pull the
blind down."
815,VINNY (CONT'D),815,I'll sort it.   .

822,SOL,822,You want to test em?
823,BTT,823,"There are two types of balls, there
are big brave balls and there are
little mincy faggot balls."
824,·p- WNNY     .,824,"You're a dead man talking. These
are your last words so make them a
prayer."
825,BTT .,825,"So you're obviously the big dick,
and they on either side of you, must
be your balls."
826,SOL,826,Let go of the gun.
827,BTT,827,"I am talking for your benefit. Now
dicks have drive, and clarity of
vision."
828,BTT (CONT'D),828,"But they're not clever, they smell
pussy, and they want a piece of the
action, and the dimmer the dick, the
less he cares about the consequences,
and you thought you smelt gooood ol
pussy, and have brought your little
mincy faggot balls along for a gooood
ol time, but you have got your parties
muddled up, there is no pussy here,
just a dose to make you wish you
were born a woman.. . ."
829,BTT (CONT'D),829,"And just like a prick, you are having
second thoughts; you're shrinking,
and your little balls are shrinking
with you."
830,VINNY,830,Pass it me.
831,VINNY,831,I won't ask again
832,BRICK TOP,832,"Quite a lump. Alright you can go         '

836,SOL,836,You alright Lincoln?
837,ERROL,837,"Do you know why the governor is the
governor?"
838,VINNY,838,Err. .
839,ERROL,839,"I t 's because people are scared of
him. You know why they are scared
of him?"
840,SOL,840,Err .
841,ERROL,841,"It's because of stories. I am sure
you've heard one or two of those
stories. For example, did you hear
about the three black fellas that
did a very bad thing, however they
made some effort to redeem that very
bad thing, so the governor saw fit
not to kill em. He thought it would
be a more advantageous concept to
let them kill each other and let the
survivor live to tell the tale.
That way everybody wins, well, all
except the two that died of course."
842,"BAD BOY LINCOLN      ,",842,Grab it.
843,SOL,843,What?
844,VINNY,844,The gun you prick.
845,BTT,845,Well you gotta admire their balls.
846,HANDS,846,"_ I don't want to admire balls that I
want to chop off."

powdered angels sitting on their
shoulders telling them what was what,
all too busy. . ."
864,BTT (CONT'D),864,"If they weren't sniffing the dust
they where flicking the ash. And
never trust who puts anything other
than a finger up his nose."

Lorrie you stabbed?"
867,BTT,867,"Yes I know I stabbed a man called

related to a tub a shit."
868,KEN,868,Shut that door Sean.

870,BTT (CONT'D),870,"You're a big man, but I don't care
if you're ten foot fuckin tall, you
still got eight pints of blood and
you'll bleed like any bastard. And

drop ya, I'll open you up like a
packet of crisps."
871,BTT (CONT'D),871,"You're a bully Ken, but remember, I
am a bigger bully."
872,HEAVY FELLA,872,"Ha, Ken what' s going on? Bring em
through. The governor wants to see
em."
873,BRICK TOP,873,"I gotta say you have got some front
coming round here Tone, you know the
lads are picking straws. . ."

belong to you, it belongs to my
colleague here."

no small talk."
876,BTT,876,"I said we should come round and raise
fuckin hell, you know shoot a few of
the boys and that, but he said he
thinks we would have more success if
we paid for it. So I am going to
have a drink and let you two discuss

more, a dog will never leave you if
you feed it properly. It was a good
dog, he had a little flatulence
problem but was a good dog."
973,HANDS,973,Are you sure he's not here?
974,MICKY,974,"I think I would have noticed if a
fuckin dog was sitting in my caravan
don't you? Tommy, Turkish, have you
seen a dog sitting in me caravan?"
975,TURKISH,975,I can't say I have Micky.
