0,LEOPOLD,0,"You dance like a herd of cattle,
Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman
who lights up the room... simply by
leaving it."
1,UNCLE OTTO,1,"Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join
us downstairs after completing this
one-sided flash of wit?"
2,LEOPOLD,2,"I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle
Otto. No one really listens to anyone
else. If you attempt it, you will
see why."
3,UNCLE OTTO,3,"You judge everything too severely. I
wonder what would happen if you were
to cast that critical eye inward?"
4,LEOPOLD,4,"You do not wonder at all. You merely
ask in order to state your own
opinion."
5,UNCLE OTTO,5,We are all concerned about you.
6,LEOPOLD,6,"Ahh, here it comes."
7,UNCLE OTTO,7,"Your life does not seem to have any
direction. At the age of 25 a man is
too young to do anything well. At 35
he is too old. Now is your time to
take action. Tell me, what is it you
want to DO with your life?"
8,LEOPOLD,8,I do not know.
9,UNCLE OTTO,9,Your ignorance cramps my conversation.
10,UNCLE OTTO,10,"Wake up! This is your one and only
life. Every man has the chance to
make a difference. DO something!"
11,LEOPOLD,11,"I am most grateful for your
surveillance and for your sympathy.
I assure you there is no need for
concern. I am as effectual and
attentive... as my position allows."
12,UNCLE OTTO,12,"Life is not position, Leopold. It is
action."
13,UNCLE OTTO,13,"I will see you downstairs promptly.
In the appropriate frame of mind."
14,THE VALET,14,Go spread joy.
15,LEOPOLD,15,"You dance like an angel, Miss
Fairchild. You light up the room. I
thank you."
16,LEOPOLD,16,"Good evening. I do not believe I
have had the pleasure."
17,CARLSON,17,...Julia Carlson.
18,CARLSON,18,I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?
19,LEOPOLD,19,"You are not from the area, are you?"
20,CARLSON,20,Are you?
21,LEOPOLD,21,This is my estate.
22,CARLSON,22,Really?
23,CARLSON,23,Well it's not home but it's much...
24,LEOPOLD,24,Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.
25,CARLSON,25,"The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't
it?"
26,LEOPOLD,26,It is a scandal nonetheless.
27,LEOPOLD,27,"Miss Carlson, do me the honor?"
28,CARLSON,28,I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.
29,LEOPOLD,29,"Truly I would be in your debt. Any
admonition would be erased simply by
presenting a partner as lovely as
yourself."
30,CARLSON,30,"No, no. Really, I..."
31,LEOPOLD,31,"I suppose we really ought to sing
along."
32,CARLSON,32,"Oh, golly."
33,CARLSON,33,"Thank you for the dance. It was
lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful
for you."
34,LEOPOLD,34,Not at all. It was most enlightening.
35,CARLSON,35,I really must be going.
36,LEOPOLD,36,I won't hear of it.
37,CARLSON,37,"No, I'm quite late as it is."
38,LEOPOLD,38,I shall see you to the door...
39,CARLSON,39,"You're very sweet. I had a wonderful
time."
40,CARLSON,40,Goodbye.
41,LEOPOLD,41,Miss Carlson?
42,LEOPOLD,42,Good God...
43,CARLSON,43,What are you...? You frightened me.
44,LEOPOLD,44,What sort of mechanism is this?
45,LEOPOLD,45,Answer me!
46,CARLSON,46,It's perfectly all right. It's...
47,CARLSON,47,"Listen to me. Please. Move very
slowly. Step out of the machine.
Step out and I'll explain whatever
you want to know."
48,LEOPOLD,48,What is this? Who are you?
49,CARLSON,49,"Oh, God."
50,CARLSON,50,Get out of there! Get out now!
51,LEOPOLD,51,Miss Carlson... I...
52,CARLSON,52,No!!!
53,CARLSON,53,Shit!!
54,DR. KAU,54,Shit!!
55,DR. KAU,55,Shit!!
56,DR. KAU,56,Shit!!
57,DR. DRAKE,57,Good God!
58,DR. PLODDER,58,"Everybody stay calm... Lock the front
door."
59,DR. PLODDER,59,"No, no, no. You mustn't touch him.
The consequences could be
catastrophic."
60,DR. KAU,60,"He could be hurt, or even dead."
61,DR. PLODDER,61,...All right. Touch him.
62,DR. KAU,62,"...But I'm stuck and it's only a
dance and he IS the seventh Duke of
Albany..."
63,DR. DRAKE,63,Carlson...!
64,DR. PLODDER,64,Give me a minute...
65,DR. KAU,65,Shit!
66,KATE,66,"Who's upset? People fall in love,
they have to climb back out."
67,KATE,67,"So, what? We'll just be friends now,
Right?"
68,KATE,68,I see. Well I appreciate your honesty.
69,KATE,69,"No. I'll just think of this as
surviving another dating accident.
Take care or good luck or whatever
I'm supposed to..."
70,KATE,70,...say... Goodbye.
71,DR. PLODDER,71,She's back.
72,KATE,72,"That's impossible! She wasn't supposed
to return until..."
73,DR. PLODDER,73,"Kate. It's Carlson. Something went
wrong."
74,KATE,74,...The 7th Duke...
75,KATE,75,"...of Albany. He was the... IS the
son of Emery and Eliza. He was of no
actual importance until he vanished
at the turn of the century without a
trace. It was a sensation. In the
30's they even made a movie about
him. ""The Tenuous Duke"" with Ronald
Coleman."
76,DR. DRAKE,76,I love Ronald Coleman.
77,KATE,77,"Despite much speculation and a nation
wide investigation, a body was never
found. He was never heard from again."
78,DR. KAU,78,Until now.
79,DR. DRAKE,79,We've altered the course of history.
80,DR. KAU,80,We never should have started this...
81,KATE,81,Calm down.
82,DR. PLODDER,82,"What are we going to do? We can't
keep him here. Imagine if anyone
found out!"
83,KATE,83,"Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now,
no one would believe such a stupid
mistake could be made because no one
would believe any of this is possible.
So. We fix this. We keep this to
ourselves and we fix it. Fast."
84,KATE,84,"Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st
priority: Locate Carlson. Drake,
determine the reciprocal correlation's
connected to the 19th century. Work
24 hours a day if necessary. In the
meantime... one of us will have to
take charge of him."
85,KATE,85,"This is a major scientific
opportunity. It doesn't get any better
than this. Imagine. Researching the
behavior, the physical and emotional
characteristics of a century ago!
Utilizing technology available to us
today... He's a gold mine!"
86,DR. PLODDER,86,"He's a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig."
87,KATE,87,"And while he's here, he's ours. Any
volunteers?"
88,DR. DRAKE,88,"We'll draw names. Whoever is is picked
will be responsible. Agreed?"
89,DR. KAU,89,I'll do it.
90,DR. PLODDER,90,You'll look after him?
91,DR. KAU,91,"No, I meant I'll pick the name."
92,KATE,92,Fine.
93,LEOPOLD,93,Where...? What has happened?!
94,KATE,94,"Your Grace... Um... Hello... Weee
aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge
research team. A project funded by
the government of the United States."
95,LEOPOLD,95,Oh. Americans. I see...
96,KATE,96,"Yes, um... For the past six and a
half years we've been conducting
scientific experiments on density
and flexibility in the dimensions of
time and space."
97,DR. DRAKE,97,"Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came
upon a formula utilizing Tachyons...
particles traveling faster than the
speed of light, which allowed us
to... fold time so to speak."
98,DR. PLODDER,98,"Yes. Bend it between the cracks of
the dimensions."
99,DR. KAU,99,Yes.
100,DR. DRAKE,100,"Now, while that wasn't the original
purpose of our experiment, we opted
to pursue it, well, privately, on
our own."
101,DR. KAU,101,Borrowing funds already provided.
102,KATE,102,"We journeyed to your time because it
was the quickest path to follow. We
debated long and hard whether we
should use this knowledge at all.
Believe me, it was never our intent
to disturb the past..."
103,DR. DRAKE,103,"Merely to discover if the expedition
were possible. As your presence here
confirms... we are very disturbed."
104,DR. PLODDER,104,"The problem facing us is not only
HOW to get you back, but WHEN, you
see?"
105,KATE,105,"We certainly don't want to
miscalculate. Send you to a different
era entirely."
106,DR. PLODDER,106,"Rest assured, no harm will come to
you. You'll be well looked after by
Dr. Coles."
107,LEOPOLD,107,"Dr. Coles...? I do not follow. What
do you mean, get me back home?...
Where am I?"
108,LEOPOLD,108,Answer me!...
109,LEOPOLD,109,"Would you have me believe... I am
being detained, at present in the
HEREAFTER?... The time to come?"
110,DR. PLODDER,110,"It is the year nineteen hundred and
ninety-five."
111,LEOPOLD,111,...19...?
112,LEOPOLD,112,"You're insane! All of you! This is
impossible!"
113,DR. PLODDER,113,"Leopold, calm down!"
114,LEOPOLD,114,"A voyage through time! What do you
take me for? Did you bring me here
by force?"
115,DR. DRAKE,115,"We're scientist, not seditionists."
116,LEOPOLD,116,"Let me out of here! I won't stand
for this another moment!"
117,KATE,117,"Leopold, wait!"
118,DR. KAU,118,You don't know what you're doing.
119,DR. PLODDER,119,Just listen to what we have to say!
120,LEOPOLD,120,19...?
121,KATE,121,Squab.
122,DR. KAU,122,Squab?
123,KATE,123,"I remember reading they ate a lot of
squab."
124,DR. KAU,124,Squab... Do you have a squab?
125,KATE,125,I don't know!
126,DR. KAU,126,Pull yourself together!
127,DR. KAU,127,Are you all right back there?
128,KATE,128,"You're going to be fine you know.
There's nothing to worry about. I
have everything under control."
129,KATE,129,We'll never get away with this.
130,KATE,130,How are you feeling?
131,KATE,131,I thought you might like some tea.
132,LEOPOLD,132,"I insist on being returned home
immediately."
133,KATE,133,I understand. We're doing our best.
134,LEOPOLD,134,"I wish to speak with your employer,
Dr. Coles."
135,KATE,135,You're speaking to him.
136,LEOPOLD,136,"You are not suggesting that you are
Dr. Coles?"
137,LEOPOLD,137,Miss... uh?
138,KATE,138,"Dr. Coles. If you like, you could
call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that's
too much, how about just plain Kate?"
139,LEOPOLD,139,A WOMAN of science?
140,KATE,140,Hard to believe?
141,LEOPOLD,141,"But a woman's brain cannot obtain
enough knowledge to posses a truly
scientific mind."
142,KATE,142,"Interesting. Nevertheless, we've
come a long way baby."
143,LEOPOLD,143,Are you attempting to be humorous?
144,KATE,144,"I'm attempting to be informative
it's just coming out humorous."
145,KATE,145,"Look, modern social science clearly
states that a woman's place in society
marks the level of that civilization.
A science career for a woman is now
almost as acceptable as being a...
a... waitress. Cream and sugar?"
146,LEOPOLD,146,"Young lady, I... Surely it is not
expected that I remain here with you
indefinitely... Unchaperoned?"
147,KATE,147,Does that make you nervous?
148,LEOPOLD,148,Certainly not!
149,KATE,149,"Then what are you getting so red
about? It's a very large apartment...
with locks on all the doors."
150,LEOPOLD,150,The idea! My dear Miss Coles...
151,KATE,151,Dr. Coles.
152,LEOPOLD,152,Honey...
153,KATE,153,"Let's get one thing straight right
now. My name is Kate or Katherine or
if you insist Dr. Coles."
154,KATE,154,"Take a good long look, Leopold. I am
a 20th century American woman with a
Doctorate and a commission and
independence. I am not your ""young
lady"" or your ""pretty Miss"" or your
""honey."" Is that clear?"
155,LEOPOLD,155,Honey... For the tea.
156,KATE,156,...I'll get it for you.
157,LEOPOLD,157,"Thank you... Has it been decided
what it is I am to do while I am
being held here?"
158,KATE,158,"Oh, just some laundry, the cooking,
a little light housework..."
159,KATE,159,"I took the liberty of preparing a
simple schedule to efficiently utilize
your time while incorporating you
into my routine."
160,KATE,160,"As you can see, my day begins with
meditation and yoga from 6:30 to
7:00."
161,KATE,161,"YOU will arise at 6:45, shower and
change and at 7:15, we breakfast
together. 7:45 we begin the days
work. At 10:45 Dr. Kau arrives to
observe you in your natural routine
as I research the data that will
enable you to return home. At 1:15
we lunch together. 2:15 you answer a
daily questionnaire, I type up my
notes. At precisely 6:15 you will
enjoy 15 minutes of FREE TIME, then,
at 6:30, I listen to Tom Brokaw while
making dinner as YOU write down any
questions that come up during your
day. At 7:00, we dine together. If
you need me at any time you may ring
this bell."
162,KATE,162,"Now, Mondays and Wednesdays I have
computer science class, Tuesdays I
have therapy. IF I have a date, I'm
usually home by 9:15. During these
periods you may read any of the books
I've picked out for you in your room.
I organize my next days work at 10:30,
11:35, David Letterman, 12:40 I'm in
bed."
163,KATE,163,Next day we begin again. Simple?
164,LEOPOLD,164,...At what time shall I WEE and POOH?
165,CHARLIE'S VOICE,165,Kate? I'm home.
166,KATE,166,Oh. Yes. Our chaperone is here.
167,LEOPOLD,167,Your father?
168,KATE,168,Sort of. My brother.
169,LEOPOLD,169,Visiting?
170,KATE,170,"For the past two years. Charlie can
never know about this project. We'll
tell him you are a... overly
distinguished colleague staying here
as our guest. From Canada. Which
would explain your lack of familiarity
with our customs and so forth"
171,LEOPOLD,171,A CANADIAN?
172,KATE,172,"Make yourself comfortable. I'll check
in on you later. I think this is
going very well, don't you?"
173,KATE,173,"Okay. If you need anything, just
ring."
174,KATE (V.O.),174,Charlie!
175,CHARLIE (V.O.),175,What?
176,KATE,176,Come here I wanna talk to you.
177,CHARLIE,177,What did I do?
178,KATE,178,"RINGS! And what did I say about you
smoking in the house?"
179,CHARLIE,179,You were against it.
180,KATE,180,Correct. You're back early.
181,CHARLIE,181,"Hey!... Are you all right? You look
funny."
182,KATE,182,Funny ha ha or funny odd?
183,CHARLIE,183,Both.
184,KATE,184,That all depends. How was your trip?
185,CHARLIE,185,Why?
186,KATE,186,"If it was good I'll tell you the
truth. If it was rotten I'll have to
butter you up first."
187,CHARLIE,187,Butter me up.
188,KATE,188,"Have you been working out? No, I'm
really starting to see results. Are
you comfortable there on the couch?"
189,CHARLIE,189,Very.
190,KATE,190,"Good. Cause you'll be sleeping there
the next few nights."
191,CHARLIE,191,Kate!
192,KATE,192,"You have to be out of here by 8 and
you can't be back before 6. We have
an important man working with us
with very unusual needs. The company
is insisting he stay here."
193,CHARLIE,193,What about a hotel?
194,KATE,194,"This man requires around the clock
attention."
195,CHARLIE,195,I meant for me.
196,KATE,196,"Thank you, Charlie."
197,KATE,197,I owe you one.
198,CHARLIE,198,"You owe me nine. What am I supposed
to do all day?"
199,KATE,199,You could get a job!
200,CHARLIE,200,"Kate, the entire point of being an
artist is that I don't have to work.
Who is this guy?"
201,KATE,201,"Well, I can't tell you much because..."
202,KATE AND CHARLIE,202,"I'm not allowed to discuss what goes
on at the office."
203,KATE,203,"Well I'm not. Anyway, it might be
interesting to have someone else to
talk to. It gets so quiet around
here sometimes I feel like I've gone
deaf."
204,CHARLIE,204,Does he have a label?
205,KATE,205,Leopold.
206,CHARLIE,206,"LEOPOLD? Is he anything like his
name?"
207,KATE,207,He's exactly like his name.
208,CHARLIE,208,Then you owe me ten.
209,LEOPOLD,209,Horrible!
210,KATE,210,He's from Canada...
211,LEOPOLD,211,What is this?
212,KATE,212,It's called Hamburger Helper.
213,LEOPOLD,213,"It is beyond help. Please serve the
next course."
214,KATE,214,"I'm afraid there is no next course.
If you make a list of the foods you
like, I'll pick them up at the store
for you."
215,LEOPOLD,215,Is all food here this... textured?
216,CHARLIE,216,Mine's good.
217,LEOPOLD,217,"Please understand, I am used to a
different sort of preparation. Where
I come from a proper meal is the
result of reflection and study. A
recipe is merely a theme which an
intelligent cook can plan each time
with variation."
218,LEOPOLD,218,"Several courses are served. Menus
are often prepared days in advance,
timed to perfection. It is said,
without the culinary art, the
crudeness of reality would make life
unbearable."
219,CHARLIE,219,In Canada?
220,LEOPOLD,220,In Canada.
221,CHARLIE,221,"We have a saying here. ""Shake and
shake the catsup bottle, none will
come and then a lot'll."""
222,LEOPOLD,222,How interesting.
223,CHARLIE,223,"Since you're such an expert on fine
cuisine, why don't you make dinner
tomorrow night?"
224,LEOPOLD,224,"It should be obvious to you that I
am NOT a domestic. You may take my
plate."
225,CHARLIE,225,"I have my own, thank you."
226,KATE,226,Charlie...
227,CHARLIE,227,Who died and made me Cinderella?
228,LEOPOLD,228,"Young man, there is a distinct
impertinence to your voice."
229,CHARLIE,229,It's part of my charm.
230,LEOPOLD,230,Suppress it.
231,KATE,231,"Leopold... Since you're our guest
here, there are several cultural
events you might enjoy seeing. Charlie
has season tickets to the ball game.
Perhaps you'd like to take that in?"
232,LEOPOLD,232,What is it?
233,CHARLIE,233,What is it??
234,KATE,234,Or the Opera or the Ballet?
235,CHARLIE,235,What is it??
236,KATE,236,"Charlie, there's no rule that says
everyone has to be interested in
baseball."
237,CHARLIE,237,"No, but I believe there is a rule
that says everyone has to have HEARD
of it."
238,LEOPOLD,238,"Dr. Coles, your brother Charles
attitude and demeanor are
unacceptable. If I am to stay on
here you must have a serious talk
with him regarding respect and
civility."
239,KATE,239,"CHARLES, could you help me with the
dessert in the kitchen?"
240,CHARLIE,240,In the kitchen?
241,KATE,241,IN the kitchen. Excuse us.
242,CHARLIE,242,I don't believe this guy!
243,KATE,243,Try to be nice to him.
244,CHARLIE,244,I'm always NICE!
245,KATE,245,"Please Charlie, as a favor to me."
246,CHARLIE,246,He gives me the creeps.
247,KATE,247,He's different that's all.
248,CHARLIE,248,What was that crack about domestics?
249,KATE,249,"Charlie, this is important to me."
250,CHARLIE,250,"You're not going out with him, are
you?"
251,KATE,251,"Eeuuu! I may be desperate but I'm
not a lost cause."
252,CHARLIE,252,"Kate, this is me. I've seen the guys
you bring home."
253,KATE,253,"I've done countless favors for you!
Now I'm asking for just one little
thing..."
254,CHARLIE,254,"Oh, all right! All right! All right!"
255,KATE,255,We forgot the dessert.
256,CHARLIE,256,"You know,... I don't know if I
mentioned it... but that is one fine
looking suit."
257,KATE,257,"What is it, Leopold?"
258,KATE,258,"WHAT IS IT, LEOPOLD?!"
259,LEOPOLD,259,I cannot seem to find the tea...
260,LEOPOLD,260,"No... No... No. Good God, no!...
Perhaps..."
261,KATE,261,"Leopold, your time is up! What's he
got, a girl in there?"
262,LEOPOLD,262,"I should like to read about modern
currency during my bath tonight. See
that the tub and basin are scrubbed
up. Remnants remain of this afternoons
shave."
263,KATE,263,"In our last session you intimated
there was a symmetrical system
regulating the social order of
conformity spanning your era. I found
this particularly intriguing If I
can just find it in my notes..."
264,LEOPOLD,264,The fire brigade!
265,LEOPOLD,265,"This is insufferable! I refuse to be
spied upon, skipped over, or shuffled
about any longer. I have yet to
venture outside this cell. Before I
go mad a more suitable arrangement
must be found."
266,KATE,266,Found it.
267,LEOPOLD,267,A resolution?
268,KATE,268,No I meant I found my notes.
269,LEOPOLD,269,Dr. Coles! Changes are in order.
270,KATE,270,I can hear you.
271,LEOPOLD,271,"Miss Coles, as we are to remain here
together, there are certain conditions
I insist are met and maintained. I
no longer wish to be peeped at,
mocked..."
272,KATE,272,I never...
273,LEOPOLD,273,"Or interrupted. Jot this down.
Breakfast at 12. Luncheon at 4. Diner
at 8. A horse should be made available
from 1 to 3."
274,KATE,274,A horse? In New York City?
275,LEOPOLD,275,"Yes. Also, I feel very strongly about
your style of dress. I do not care
for it."
276,LEOPOLD,276,"I cannot believe it is the prevailing
taste for women to appear masculine
and unkempt. If this is the fashion,
have it altered."
277,LEOPOLD,277,That is all for the present.
278,LEOPOLD,278,"CRUMBS, my dear!"
279,KATE,279,Thank you!
280,LEOPOLD,280,"Dr. Coles. I have been acquainted
with many women in my time, yet I am
compelled to say that the modern
woman is by far the least attractive
I have ever encountered."
281,KATE,281,And I have a news flash of my own.
282,KATE,282,"You sir, are no Ronald Coleman!"
283,DR. DRAKE,283,"Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough
Swirl or Peach?"
284,DR. KAU,284,Peach.
285,DR. DRAKE,285,Any luck?
286,DR. KAU,286,"Yea. Lots of luck. All bad. No
information exists detailing what
happened to Carlson. I've been working
for weeks and I'm not any closer
than when I began... How are you
doing?"
287,DR. DRAKE,287,My cholesterol level is up 70 points.
288,DR. DRAKE,288,"Thank you, Kate... How're you managing
with Leopold?"
289,KATE,289,Fine. Fine... Why? What did you hear?
290,DR. DRAKE,290,Nothing. I was just asking.
291,KATE,291,"Oh. Well, it's fine. He's a delight.
Everything's under control."
292,DR. KAU,292,Keep up the good work.
293,DR. KAU,293,"She seemed a little scattered. Do
you think everything's all right?"
294,DR. DRAKE,294,"Katherine Coles is the most capable
person we have on this project. If
anyone can handle the delicacy of
this situation, Kate can."
295,DR. KAU,295,So there's nothing to worry about?
296,DR. DRAKE,296,Absolutely not.
297,KATE,297,GONE? GONE WHERE?!
298,KATE,298,Charlie we've got to find him!
299,CHARLIE,299,"Are you crazy? This is the first
time all week my eyes aren't darting
to the top of my sockets every five
minutes."
300,KATE,300,When did he leave?
301,CHARLIE,301,"I don't know. An hour ago? He said
he wanted to take a walk."
302,KATE,302,"And you let him?? He's not allowed
to go outside!"
303,CHARLIE,303,Is he being punished?
304,KATE,304,"We've got to find him! You stay here
in case he finds his way back. And
while you wait you'd better pray
he's all right. If anything happens
to him, anything at all, EVERYTHING
we've worked for will have been
destroyed."
305,CHARLIE,305,"Kate, calm down."
306,KATE,306,And YOU'LL be responsible. Understand?
307,CHARLIE,307,"What's the big deal? Who is this
guy?"
308,KATE,308,Leopold... is not really from Canada.
309,CHARLIE (V.O.),309,OH MY GOD!!!
310,WOMAN MOTORIST,310,"You stupid fucking son of a bitch.
Next time I'll hit ya. Fucking moron."
311,CABBY,311,"What're ya waiting for lady? An
invitation?"
312,KATE,312,I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
313,LEOPOLD,313,$7.95 for a sandwich? Is that correct?
314,COUNTER MAN,314,You gotta problem with that?
315,LEOPOLD,315,It seems rather pricey to me.
316,COUNTER MAN,316,So don't buy one.
317,LEOPOLD,317,I shan't.
318,COUNTER MAN,318,So shan't!
319,LEOPOLD,319,"Yes, I... I would be happy to sample
one however I'm afraid I haven't the
finance with me just now. If I could
establish a credit with you, I will
have someone come round with the
funds tomorrow."
320,COUNTER MAN,320,"You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a
hamburger today, is that it?"
321,LEOPOLD,321,I believe so. Yes.
322,COUNTER MAN,322,Get the fuck outta here.
323,LEOPOLD,323,I beg your pardon?
324,COUNTER MAN,324,Get out. Fuckin' Wimpys piss me off.
325,LEOPOLD,325,"May I remind you, merchant, that I
am the customer in this establishment
and as such require your attention
and the utmost respect. I do not
accept this modern convention of
desecrating one's patrons with such
contemptuous disregard."
326,YUPPIE WOMAN,326,You tell him.
327,LEOPOLD,327,"Need I add that without our patronage
you would not own that unwashed
counter behind which you spew your
filthy mouth?"
328,COUNTER MAN,328,"Where do you get off? You don't even
have any money."
329,LEOPOLD,329,Don't be irrelevant... I'm browsing.
330,COUNTER MAN,330,Not in my store you're not.
331,LEOPOLD,331,"Do you intend to physically escort
me out...?"
332,LEOPOLD,332,"Did you see what he did? Did you see
that?"
333,KATE,333,"Leopold! Leopold, get in."
334,KATE,334,"Leopold! Oh, Leopold thank God you're
all right. I didn't think I'd ever
find you. You had us all so worried.
Oh, Leopold!"
335,KATE,335,"Don't you ever go out again without
my permission, do you hear me? I was
frantic. You could have been killed
a hundred times over. I never would
have known."
336,KATE,336,"Leopold, are you all right?"
337,LEOPOLD,337,I wish to go home.
338,KATE,338,Okay. I'll get you home in a jiffy.
339,LEOPOLD,339,No... I wish to go home.
340,CHARLIE,340,"I don't know. It's just Leopold.
Like Cher. Or Goofy."
341,CHARLIE,341,"Never mind they just walked in. Jesus.
You look horrible."
342,KATE,342,"Charlie, don't start. I haven't been
this angry at you since you got me
into that pyramid thing last year.
If you make a wisecrack I'm going to
burst into flame."
343,CHARLIE,343,"It wasn't a wisecrack. You do look
horrible."
344,KATE,344,"I'm too tired for this now. I'll
just save it up and kill you tomorrow.
Help Leopold out of his things and
lets get him to bed."
345,LEOPOLD,345,"I've something to say. To the both
of you. I... Nothing is what it seems.
After witnessing mere weeks of this
age it is painfully apparent I am
outside of my acquaintance... I don't
know how to proceed. I frankly... am
in need of assistance. I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at this. In the
event you have missed it, I am
apologizing."
346,CHARLIE,346,About time.
347,CHARLIE,347,Welcome back.
348,KATE,348,"Don't mind him. His heart would be
in the right place if he had a heart.
Surliness runs in my family."
349,LEOPOLD,349,"I understand. It practically races
through mine."
350,KATE,350,"Leopold, you made a joke. I mean one
that's not at my expense. That's
good."
351,LEOPOLD,351,We'd better get to bed... That is...
352,KATE,352,Yes... I start work...
353,KATE,353,in three and a half hours.
354,LEOPOLD,354,"Oh, dear."
355,KATE,355,It's fine. I'm used to it.
356,LEOPOLD,356,"You mustn't get too used to it. You'll
find life passes you by awfully
quickly."
357,LEOPOLD,357,Thank you for...
358,KATE,358,Oh!
359,LEOPOLD,359,"Well, goodnight then."
360,KATE,360,"Leopold?... I don't have a clear
handle on this. Perhaps I was wrong
keeping you confined to the apartment
all this time. I don't know when
you'll be able return home... Tomorrow
I'll start preparing you for the
outside world. And... We'll find
your way back. I promise."
361,KATE (V.O.),361,Yes?
362,LEOPOLD,362,"Oh! I beg your pardon. I, I, I, was
merely... I didn't..."
363,KATE,363,"Is there something you want, Leopold?"
364,LEOPOLD,364,"I merely wanted to see... that is,
inquire, on your availability, for
an outing... My assimilation and so
forth."
365,KATE,365,"Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of
us. I'll be out in a minute."
366,LEOPOLD,366,"Yes, of course. Splendid."
367,LEOPOLD,367,Are you certain this is correct?
368,KATE,368,Certainly I'm certain.
369,LEOPOLD,369,Now really. Isn't this better?
370,LEOPOLD,370,Allow me.
371,LEOPOLD,371,Sorry. Oops! Careful there. So sorry.
372,LEOPOLD,372,Have you seen today's paper?
373,KATE,373,Put it back.
374,LEOPOLD,374,But...
375,KATE,375,Back!
376,LEOPOLD,376,"Dr. Coles, why is it you are not
married?"
377,KATE,377,"Women are longer defined by the men
they're married to, Leopold. I have
a career. I haven't found a man who
fits in with that yet."
378,LEOPOLD,378,Yet people still marry?
379,KATE,379,I've heard of cases.
380,LEOPOLD,380,"I suspect there is something wrong
with you."
381,KATE,381,There's nothing wrong with me!
382,LEOPOLD,382,"Perhaps it is the way you present
yourself."
383,KATE,383,"I don't know what you're talking
about."
384,LEOPOLD,384,"There is some sort of problem when a
woman reaches thirty and insists on
remaining single."
385,KATE,385,You think I'm THIRTY?!
386,LEOPOLD,386,What?
387,KATE,387,Do I look THIRTY to you?
388,LEOPOLD,388,It was an arbitrary number.
389,KATE,389,"You chose it specifically opposed to
a lower number."
390,LEOPOLD,390,I didn't mean it.
391,KATE,391,...Thirty!
392,LEOPOLD,392,I apologize... How old are you?
393,KATE,393,"I'm thirty! But you're the first
person whoever told me I looked it!"
394,LEOPOLD,394,I'm sorry.
395,KATE,395,"And it's not that I insist on
remaining single. Believe me. Everyone
dreams of finding somebody to share
their life with. To give someone all
the love they've been hoarding since
they were a kid. I'm no different.
But one has to be sensible. I have a
career and a life that's filled
with..."
396,KATE,396,Not again...
397,KATE,397,"What do I have to do? Put a leash
around your neck?"
398,LEOPOLD,398,"She is the woman to whom I was
referring. You see the problem?"
399,SALESLADY,399,Yep.
400,KATE,400,What?... What?
401,KATE,401,"This is ridiculous. I don't have
time to..."
402,KATE,402,"Do you know what this dress costs?
Let's get this over with. I'm coming
out. Nobody laugh."
403,KATE,403,Satisfied?
404,KATE,404,...What?
405,LEOPOLD,405,You have a lovely face.
406,LEOPOLD,406,We'll take the dress.
407,LEOPOLD,407,What is this?
408,KATE,408,The drug of the 20th century.
409,KATE,409,"Leopold, your dinner's getting cold."
410,LEOPOLD,410,I'm coming.
411,KATE,411,It's a guy thing.
412,KATE,412,"...Now within that astronomical
structure, Dr. Drake here is searching
for a pathway between your time and
the present. He'll find it too if
his arteries don't harden first."
413,LEOPOLD,413,Astounding.
414,KATE,414,"Once that is discovered, the search
begins for the exact time and date
travel will be possible."
415,LEOPOLD,415,How are you proceeding?
416,KATE,416,"Don't take it personally. Once Dr.
Kau starts working, you just have to
wait until her batteries run down.
We're all pretty much like that."
417,LEOPOLD,417,"The complexity of this equation is
astonishing? Can you really comprehend
all that?"
418,KATE,418,I'm a genius.
419,LEOPOLD,419,You're quite exceptional Dr. Coles.
420,LEOPOLD,420,"That is to say, you all are."
421,KATE,421,"Thank you. And may I say that
sometimes, in DIM light, you're not
so bad yourself."
422,KATE,422,"Oh my God! Is that the time? I'm
late. Therapy. Every Tuesday night."
423,LEOPOLD,423,May I accompany you?
424,KATE,424,You mayn't.
425,LEOPOLD,425,I am not certain I understand therapy.
426,KATE,426,"No one does. That's why therapists
can charge so much."
427,LEOPOLD,427,"What exactly transpires during
therapy?"
428,KATE,428,"Leopold. A gentleman does not ask
those questions. Come on, we'll get
you home."
429,LEOPOLD,429,"I am perfectly able to travel homeward
myself."
430,LEOPOLD,430,"Really! I have finance and our
address. I shall take a cabbie."
431,LEOPOLD,431,"You are late. I insist. I am NOT a
child. Dr. Coles."
432,KATE,432,All right. Don't bite my head off.
433,LEOPOLD,433,I can't seem to...
434,NUN,434,"Oh, for heaven's sake..."
435,MRS. PINCUS,435,"I was worried. I thought you weren't
going to make it."
436,KATE,436,"Miss my lesson? This is the only
thing I have to look forward to all
week. Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus?"
437,INSTRUCTOR,437,"All right, kids. Pair up!"
438,INSTRUCTOR,438,"Don't think so much, Katie. FEEL the
music."
439,KATE,439,I am!
440,INSTRUCTOR,440,"Dancing should not be work. It should
be a vacation the body takes from
the mind. Let the music wash over
you."
441,KATE,441,It is!
442,INSTRUCTOR,442,"Repeat after me: I've got the muusic
in me."
443,KATE,443,I've got the muusic in me.
444,INSTRUCTOR & KATE,444,I've got the muusic in me!
445,INSTRUCTOR,445,Keep telling yourself that.
446,DR. KAU,446,I've located her.
447,DR. PLODDER,447,You didn't! Is she all right?
448,DR. KAU,448,No. She's really not.
449,DR. KAU,449,"It was taken a year after she arrived.
Look at her face! We have to get her
back."
450,DR. PLODDER,450,"Christine, this morning I spoke with
the head of funding. They're talking
about canceling the project."
451,DR. KAU,451,What?! They can't do that!
452,DR. PLODDER,452,"There's still time. Nothing has
happened yet that can't be undone.
We'll get her back. We'll put this
behind us and we'll get her back."
453,CHARLIE,453,Is there something on your mind?
454,LEOPOLD,454,This is rather difficult for me.
455,CHARLIE,455,...Uh huh...?
456,LEOPOLD,456,"I have been in the salon contemplating
the reception I have received by the
various tradesmen I have visited.
I've determined I am lacking the
dexterity of modern intercourse."
457,CHARLIE,457,Of what??
458,LEOPOLD,458,Social skills.
459,CHARLIE,459,Oh.
460,LEOPOLD,460,"I realize our association has been
rather distant and I bear you no ill
will."
461,CHARLIE,461,You can imagine my relief.
462,LEOPOLD,462,The fact is... I need help.
463,CHARLIE,463,Why not ask Kate?
464,LEOPOLD,464,"I would appreciate the masculine
point of view."
465,CHARLIE,465,Why not ask Kate?... That was a joke.
466,CHARLIE,466,"Well? Let's see... I guess we could
start by removing that great big
stick from up your... Let's start
with your walk."
467,LEOPOLD,467,My walk?
468,CHARLIE,468,You don't walk right.
469,CHARLIE,469,You strut.
470,LEOPOLD,470,STRUT?
471,CHARLIE,471,"Strut strut strut. You walk into the
bathroom it's like I'm watching a
parade. Walk across the room."
472,LEOPOLD,472,I will not.
473,CHARLIE,473,"I know you won't. You'll STRUT. You
asked for my help. Trust me on this."
474,LEOPOLD,474,That's enough! Really! You walk.
475,CHARLIE,475,See? Easy. Relaxed. You try.
476,CHARLIE,476,"That's better. Now, try to enjoy
your walk. It's a beautiful day. The
sun is shining, the peasants are
singing."
477,CHARLIE,477,Interesting?
478,CHARLIE,478,What the hell is that?
479,LEOPOLD,479,What?
480,CHARLIE,480,"Leopold, are you wearing a corset?"
481,LEOPOLD,481,Naturally.
482,CHARLIE,482,"What'd ya say was the name of this
number?"
483,LEOPOLD,483,Tchaikovsky. Waltz of the Flowers.
484,CHARLIE,484,Pretty.
485,CHARLIE,485,Megadeath. High Speed Dirt.
486,LEOPOLD,486,What in the world...?
487,MAN,487,Sorry! We're so sorry. Are you hurt?
488,WOMAN,488,"She's another Babe Ruth. We had no
idea. Are you okay?"
489,WOMAN,489,"What do you have to say for yourself,
Elizabeth?"
490,ELIZABETH,490,I'm sorry!
491,LEOPOLD,491,Is this your child?
492,MAN,492,Yes.
493,LEOPOLD,493,I see.
494,WOMAN,494,"C'mon honey, lets go."
495,ELIZABETH,495,I want my ball.
496,LEOPOLD,496,Just a moment!
497,LEOPOLD,497,Pick a hand.
498,LEOPOLD,498,My mother's name was Elizabeth.
499,LEOPOLD,499,"She's a beautiful child. You're very
lucky."
500,MAN,500,"What do you say, Elizabeth?"
501,MAN,501,Thank you.
502,LEOPOLD,502,"I understand pumpkin pies, pizza
pies, and pot pies. But I wish someone
would explain Eskimo pies."
503,LEOPOLD,503,"You smoke Camel's, you wear Old
Spices, and you drink Mountains Dew.
It's revolting."
504,LEOPOLD,504,"The pudding tonight is excellent.
Another thing I've noticed, everyone
is in a great rush today. Instant
Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick,
Minute Maid. You'll find there's
much to be said for moderation and
languor."
505,LEOPOLD,505,Mmmm. Is it tapioca?
506,KATE,506,It's margarine.
507,LEOPOLD,507,It's marvelous.
508,CHARLIE,508,"Well, I'm off."
509,KATE,509,"Me too. Work to do. Where are you
going?"
510,CHARLIE,510,"I'm meeting everyone over at Caffeine.
It's this coffee house we go to."
511,KATE,511,Say hello to Dennis for me.
512,LEOPOLD,512,Who is that?
513,CHARLIE,513,"Dennis is this really good looking
friend of mine who doesn't know Kate's
alive because SHE doesn't know how
to flirt."
514,KATE,514,"As a rule I don't like to associate
with really good looking people. It
makes me feel really... I don't
know... Smart. But Dennis is a nice
guy."
515,CHARLIE,515,And he always picks up the check.
516,LEOPOLD,516,Sounds enjoyable. I shall join you.
517,CHARLIE,517,What?
518,KATE,518,"That's a wonderful idea! Leopold
mentioned how he wanted to meet...
People of quality was it?"
519,CHARLIE,519,Ahhhhh?
520,LEOPOLD,520,If you'd rather I didn't go...
521,KATE,521,"Nonsense! Charlie, you don't want to
hurt Leopold's feelings. He's going
to think you don't want him to go."
522,CHARLIE,522,"Oh it's not that. It's just that
it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all.
I'm not sure you'd have such a good
time."
523,LEOPOLD,523,"A little ribald humor? I'm not as
big a stick in the mud as you might
think! I'd enjoy a gay night out,
kicking up my heels."
524,CHARLIE,524,"Finish off your Parquet and we'll
go."
525,CHARLIE,525,"There they all are. Now one more
thing. Throw the words ""like"" and
""you know"" into a sentence whenever
possible. It's how people talk today."
526,LEOPOLD,526,"Proper speech does not cease to exist
simply because it is ignored."
527,CHARLIE,527,Please?
528,LEOPOLD,528,"Charles, you needn't fret. I have
the walk down pat. I will not give
myself away. Like."
529,CHARLIE,529,Oh shit!
530,CHARLIE,530,Shoot.
531,LEOPOLD,531,What is it?
532,CHARLIE,532,"Patrice. See that girl? The blonde
one? She's so inconceivably hot."
533,LEOPOLD,533,She's very pretty.
534,CHARLIE,534,She's mine.
535,LEOPOLD,535,Congratulations.
536,CHARLIE,536,"Ok not exactly mine. But I saw her
first."
537,LEOPOLD,537,I understand.
538,CHARLIE,538,"Okay. I guess we should go in. I
don't suppose we could tell everyone
you don't speak English?"
539,LEOPOLD,539,Of course not. Let's go inside.
540,ALL,540,Charlie! Where've you been? etc.
541,CHARLIE,541,"Hi. Uh everyone, this is my friend,
Leo."
542,BILL,542,Hey.
543,LEOPOLD,543,Hey.
544,DENNIS,544,Waz up?
545,LEOPOLD,545,Waz up?
546,PATRICE,546,How are ya?
547,LEOPOLD,547,How are ya?
548,CHARLIE,548,Leo's staying with us for a while.
549,LEOPOLD,549,May I?
550,PATRICE,550,Help yourself.
551,LEOPOLD,551,"Thank you, my dear."
552,CHARLIE,552,Um?...
553,CHARLIE,553,...I have nothing to say.
554,LEOPOLD,554,"You did not tell the truth about
Patrice, Charles."
555,DENNIS AND BILL,555,CHARLES??
556,CHARLIE,556,"What did I tell you, LEO?"
557,LEOPOLD,557,"He informed me you were inconceivably
HOT, but I think you're lovely.
Exceptionally lovely."
558,PATRICE,558,"Thank you, Leo."
559,CHARLIE,559,Check please.
560,CHARLIE,560,Just drop it Leopold.
561,LEOPOLD,561,"But Charles, it is so ridiculous. I
am not interested in her."
562,CHARLIE,562,Hah!
563,LEOPOLD,563,"In any case the problem is not with
me but with you."
564,LEOPOLD,564,"You have no idea what it takes to go
about courting a woman. From what
I've witnessed tonight, it is
symptomatic of your entire generation."
565,CHARLIE,565,"You are some piece of work, Leopold."
566,LEOPOLD,566,Now I do not wish to get personal...
567,LEOPOLD,567,"But you have been of great assistance
to me and I feel this is one area
where I can be of some real help."
568,CHARLIE,568,I'm fascinated. Go on.
569,LEOPOLD,569,"Now, why was I successful with this
young lady and why did you so
miserably fail?"
570,CHARLIE,570,What makes you think she likes you?
571,LEOPOLD,571,"Well she gave me the number of her
telephone and I assumed it meant..."
572,CHARLIE,572,Go on.
573,LEOPOLD,573,"As I see it, the girl hasn't an
inkling of your intentions. And it's
no wonder. You, Charles, are a Merry
Andrew."
574,CHARLIE,574,A what?
575,LEOPOLD,575,A Merry Andrew.
576,CHARLIE,576,I am not!!
577,LEOPOLD,577,"Everything plays like a farce to
you. The more wit, the less courage.
I believe the modern woman desires
passion, protection, sensitivity. No
woman wants to be romanced by a
buffoon."
578,LEOPOLD,578,"Banter and repartee are fine but you
must add to that a different sort of
playfulness."
579,CHARLIE,579,You think I should pounce?
580,LEOPOLD,580,"I'm saying you must treat her with
respect. Any oaf can attempt a crude
pass. A woman of Kate's stature would
never respond to an artificial tactic."
581,CHARLIE,581,Kate?
582,LEOPOLD,582,What?
583,CHARLIE,583,You said Kate.
584,LEOPOLD,584,I did not.
585,CHARLIE,585,Yes you did. Didn't he say Kate?
586,LEOPOLD,586,We are discussing your problem.
587,CHARLIE,587,Not anymore. You like my sister.
588,LEOPOLD,588,Charles...
589,CHARLIE,589,"She has trouble with men, you know."
590,LEOPOLD,590,"Perhaps she has not met the right
one."
591,CHARLIE,591,"She has met the right one. HUNDREDS
of times. But she pulls back. She
cuts herself off. You turn around
and suddenly you're dating a Sphinx."
592,LEOPOLD,592,One never can tell.
593,CHARLIE,593,Does Kate know how you feel?
594,LEOPOLD,594,No...
595,CHARLIE,595,"Have you made your intentions known
to her?"
596,LEOPOLD,596,No...
597,CHARLIE,597,"Who's the Merry Andrew now?! I think
you're all talk and no action. What
are you waiting for?"
598,LEOPOLD,598,"I do not know if there is a future
in it."
599,CHARLIE,599,"Well Leopold, no one ever does..."
600,KATE,600,"Royal family -- Uncouth. Making Out --
slow soulful kissing... Woman as
equals??"
601,KATE,601,"Who drove the Chevy to the levy and
why was it dry?"
602,KATE,602,"Eyes shine when she talks about...
science. Raises her voice when she
knows she's wrong. BOSSY, BOSSY,
BOSSY. Lose my train of thought when
I see her smile. Most beautiful when
she's angry. Honorable heart...
Peasant feet."
603,KATE,603,Ooops. Bread and butter.
604,LEOPOLD,604,What's that?
605,KATE,605,"Bread and butter. It's an old
saying... Well not to you I guess.
You say it when you pass someone in
a cramped space. As close as bread
and butter."
606,LEOPOLD,606,I see.
607,KATE,607,"So. Did you have a good time last
night?"
608,LEOPOLD,608,It was very interesting.
609,KATE,609,Did you find that person of quality?
610,LEOPOLD,610,Yes. I did.
611,KATE,611,Well... fine.
612,KATE,612,I guess it's time to turn in.
613,LEOPOLD,613,Yes.
614,KATE,614,Goodnight.
615,LEOPOLD,615,Kate?
616,LEOPOLD,616,Goodnight.
617,CHARLIE,617,Hi. I brought you some flowers.
618,PATRICE,618,Charlie!
619,CHARLIE,619,"Miss Wochuchowski? I was wondering
if you would do me the great honor
of accompanying me to the cinema
tonight. And allowing me the privilege
of escorting you to dinner afterwards."
620,PATRICE,620,It's beautiful.
621,CHARLIE,621,"Gracing me with your conversation
and company would mean the world to
me."
622,PATRICE,622,Um... 7:00?
623,CHARLIE,623,7:00 is fine. I'll call for you then.
624,LEOPOLD,624,Goodbye.
625,CHARLIE,625,Goodbye.
626,CHARLIE,626,It worked!
627,LEOPOLD,627,Of course it did.
628,CHARLIE,628,"Leopold, I... I'm... I have no idea
what to do next!"
629,LEOPOLD,629,Charles. Leave everything to me.
630,CHARLIE,630,"Not so fast, buddy. You're next."
631,LEOPOLD,631,Good morning.
632,KATE,632,Good morning. You're up early.
633,LEOPOLD,633,I'm terribly sorry!!
634,KATE,634,Happens all the time...
635,LEOPOLD,635,"Dr. Coles?... ah, Kate? I was
wondering..."
636,LEOPOLD,636,What it is you're working on.
637,KATE,637,Oh. It's my computer.
638,LEOPOLD,638,"I see. Actually I meant the work
itself."
639,KATE,639,"I'm researching the correlations
between your time and the present."
640,KATE,640,"I'm TRYING to get you home, Leopold."
641,LEOPOLD,641,Oh.
642,LEOPOLD,642,"I have never seen a woman work as
diligently and extensively before."
643,KATE,643,It's made me the man I am today.
644,LEOPOLD,644,"It's quite a beautiful day, have you
noticed? Perhaps you would permit
yourself some time off and grant me
the privilege of escorting you around
the city this fine Spring afternoon."
645,KATE,645,"Oh, I'd love to but I can't. I've
got too much work to do. Ask Charlie
though. He'll go with you."
646,LEOPOLD,646,"I'm afraid it really wouldn't be the
same. It is YOUR company I am seeking."
647,KATE,647,"Oh, Leopold. I'm so sorry. I can't."
648,LEOPOLD,648,I see. Some other time then.
649,KATE,649,Yes... Thank you.
650,KATE,650,"Oh for crying out loud. Would you
look at this? Leopold? The computer's
on the blink again."
651,KATE,651,Cheap piece of equipment. I can't...
652,LEOPOLD,652,Maybe if you...
653,KATE,653,"NO, no, it does this all the time.
Just have to wait it out."
654,LEOPOLD,654,I see.
655,KATE,655,Darn.
656,LEOPOLD,656,...Perhaps it is a sign?
657,KATE,657,"Oh, you think?"
658,KATE,658,"I... I must have gotten a funny
horse..."
659,LEOPOLD,659,Allow me.
660,LEOPOLD,660,"Is that supposed to be my hair? Do
you see how they think my hair looks?"
661,KATE,661,"That's simplicity in it's purest
form. It speaks volumes in it's
nothingness. Whiteness representing
emptiness. Hopelessness. It's bleak.
Bleak!"
662,LEOPOLD,662,Aaand this represents...?
663,KATE,663,Absolutely nothing.
664,LEOPOLD,664,"I'd almost forgotten how beautiful
it was. Truly. Beautiful."
665,LEOPOLD,665,"M & M's, CBS, FBI."
666,KATE,666,"VIP, VHS, VCR."
667,LEOPOLD,667,"Ah, JFK, PDQ, XYZ."
668,KATE,668,I don't know. K.D. Lang.
669,LEOPOLD,669,"I don't know how you keep up with
it. I'm exhausted."
670,KATE,670,So am I.
671,LEOPOLD,671,"I'll tell you what. Why don't I
prepare dinner tomorrow night? I
never have before. I mean even before
I hit town. ""Hit town"" How's that? I
can't imagine what it'll taste like,
but I don't think it will be any
worse than your cooking."
672,KATE,672,"Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night."
673,LEOPOLD,673,I see.
674,KATE,674,A blind date.
675,LEOPOLD,675,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
676,KATE,676,"No, that just means I haven't met
him before. It was set up through
friends."
677,LEOPOLD,677,Ah!
678,KATE,678,"A hazard of single life... I'm turning
in."
679,LEOPOLD,679,Another time then.
680,KATE,680,I'm sorry.
681,LEOPOLD,681,It's quite all right.
682,KATE,682,"Leopold? I had a wonderful time today.
I can't remember the last time I
took the day off and just played.
I'd forgotten how beautiful this
city can be... I want to thank you
for that."
683,LEOPOLD,683,The pleasure was mine.
684,CHARLIE,684,"It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold.
Are you sure you can teach me
everything there is to know?"
685,KATE,685,"Just don't swipe the silverware and
give yourself away."
686,CHARLIE,686,Nobody's talking to you.
687,LEOPOLD,687,"It is very simple. I will be your
date. Just behave as you normally
would and I'll correct you along the
way. Now, escort me in."
688,CHARLIE,688,Now what?
689,LEOPOLD,689,Pull the chair for a lady! Clod.
690,KATE (V.O.),690,No name calling.
691,LEOPOLD,691,"Well, really!"
692,LEOPOLD,692,"You're not shoveling coal into a
furnace, Charles. Glide the chair in
gently. Gently. Try it again."
693,LEOPOLD,693,"Well, sit down!"
694,CHARLIE,694,"Now don't burst a vein or anything,
but there are quite a few knives and
forks here. How do I know what each
one's for?"
695,LEOPOLD,695,"Merely start from the outside and
work your way in."
696,CHARLIE,696,What kind of beer should I order?
697,LEOPOLD,697,Beer!
698,CHARLIE,698,I WAS KIDDING!
699,KATE,699,How do I look?
700,LEOPOLD,700,"You look exquisite, Katherine."
701,KATE,701,"Thank you, Leopold."
702,CHARLIE,702,This is a tie I'm wearing.
703,KATE,703,"You look very nice, Charlie."
704,CHARLIE,704,Yes. I know.
705,KATE,705,That must be him.
706,LEOPOLD,706,Your bland date?
707,KATE,707,Blind date.
708,CHARLIE,708,"Remember to breathe, Kate. And don't
use to many big words. You'll scare
the poor slob away."
709,KATE,709,This is always the scary part.
710,KATE,710,"""Open the door to my, Mystery Date."""
711,LARRY,711,Hi. Kate?
712,KATE,712,Larry?
713,KATE,713,"Well, I'm off."
714,LEOPOLD,714,"Kate, may I have a word with you?"
715,KATE,715,Now?
716,LEOPOLD,716,Yes.
717,LEOPOLD,717,I DON'T like the look of him.
718,KATE,718,What are you talking about?
719,LEOPOLD,719,Cad. I can spot one a mile away.
720,LEOPOLD,720,"I shall escort you out myself. I
will act as your chaperone."
721,KATE,721,That isn't necessary. I'll be fine.
722,LEOPOLD,722,It is no trouble.
723,KATE,723,"Goodnight, Leopold."
724,LEOPOLD,724,But...
725,KATE,725,Goodnight.
726,LARRY,726,Sit down.
727,KATE,727,Thank you.
728,LARRY,728,So. How am I doing?
729,KATE,729,I beg your pardon?
730,LARRY,730,"How am I doing? First date. You
pleased? You disappointed?"
731,KATE,731,Undecided.
732,LARRY,732,I see.
733,LARRY,733,So. What did Jeannie say about me?
734,KATE,734,"About you? Ah, she said you were
tall."
735,LARRY,735,6'3.
736,KATE,736,And nice looking.
737,LARRY,737,Thank you.
738,KATE,738,"Thank her. And that you persevere
ardently on Wall Street."
739,LARRY,739,"Well, I work there..."
740,KATE,740,That must be very interesting.
741,LARRY,741,"You've obviously never worked on
Wall Street."
742,KATE,742,No.
743,LARRY,743,What else did Jeannie say about me?
744,PATRICE,744,"Have I told you how much I liked
your painting?"
745,CHARLIE,745,Twice.
746,PATRICE,746,"If you get tired of hearing about
it, let me know. I have to admit I
was sort of surprised when you called.
I didn't think you liked me, Charlie."
747,CHARLIE,747,"When I first saw you, I thought..."
748,PATRICE,748,What do you think now?
749,KATE,749,"Aaand that's about all Jeannie said.
What did Jeannie say about me?"
750,LARRY,750,"She said you were enormously sexy,
had a great body, but you don't put
out."
751,KATE,751,Quite a compelling portrait.
752,LARRY,752,"Would you say it's an accurate
portrait?"
753,KATE,753,A masterpiece.
754,LARRY,754,"So this guy wants to invest $50,000
in a stock that's no good. Here's
what I do..."
755,LARRY,755,"I'm telling you the guy was a DICK!
A total ASSHOLE!"
756,KATE,756,Who?
757,LARRY,757,"Jeff Murray. The guy I've been talking
about. Hello?"
758,KATE,758,Goodbye.
759,KATE,759,Don't get up.
760,KATE,760,Leopold?
761,KATE,761,Leopold?
762,KATE,762,"Oh, Leopold..."
763,KATE,763,Oh!
764,LEOPOLD,764,Bread and butter.
765,LEOPOLD,765,"You're back early. Did you enjoy
your date?"
766,KATE,766,No.
767,KATE,767,"Here, you've got some..."
768,LEOPOLD,768,Is it gone?
769,KATE,769,No.
770,KATE,770,"A funny thing happened to me on my
bland date this evening, Leopold. I
really can't explain it. This puffed-
up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn
kept popping into my mind all night
long at the most inopportune times.
I couldn't get rid of him."
771,LEOPOLD,771,How inconsiderate.
772,KATE,772,"Yeah, it was. The harder I tried,
the more persistent he became. He's
conceited and inflated and unseasoned
and it doesn't seem to matter...
He's 134 years old but I can't get
him out of my head."
773,LEOPOLD,773,Is he there right now?
774,KATE,774,Right here. Larger than life.
775,LEOPOLD,775,I'll protect you...
776,LEOPOLD,776,"Dr. Coles, would you grant me license
to dine with you tomorrow evening at
eight o'clock?"
777,KATE,777,Permission granted.
778,LEOPOLD,778,"Until tomorrow, then."
779,LEOPOLD,779,You look beautiful.
780,KATE,780,YOU do. What have you got there?
781,KATE,781,Hamburger Helper!
782,LEOPOLD,782,I know you like it.
783,LEOPOLD,783,Tell me more.
784,KATE,784,"Um, where was I? So after my father
died I had to go to work."
785,LEOPOLD,785,Have you had many jobs?
786,KATE,786,"Many. I got fired from all of them.
I'm the most unskilled person I know.
But they were just survival jobs
while I was still in school. I always
knew I wanted to go into science
like my father. And I did."
787,LEOPOLD,787,Do you miss him?
788,KATE,788,"I think about him every day. He was
courtly, just like you."
789,LEOPOLD,789,"I think you are a remarkable woman
Katherine Coles."
790,KATE,790,"You just don't get out much. You'd
be surprised how remarkable I'm not."
791,LEOPOLD,791,"No, it is you who would be surprised."
792,LEOPOLD,792,Kate...
793,CHARLIE,793,Good morning.
794,PATRICE,794,Morning.
795,KATE,795,Morning.
796,LEOPOLD,796,Good morning.
797,KATE,797,Look what you've done!
798,LEOPOLD,798,It's nothing.
799,KATE,799,"Nothing? My own mother never made me
a breakfast like this."
800,LEOPOLD,800,I will have to have a talk with her.
801,KATE,801,Leopold...
802,LEOPOLD,802,Kate...
803,KATE,803,About last night...
804,LEOPOLD,804,Please sit down.
805,LEOPOLD,805,"Kate, I had never before been a
considerate man. I had, with
astonishing complacency, squandered
my life, waiting for some incentive
to force me into action. You have
made me see how rare our time here
really is. I am most beholden to you
Kate. And always will be."
806,KATE,806,"I sense the word ""BUT"" entering into
this any minute now."
807,LEOPOLD,807,"Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming
my wife."
808,LEOPOLD,808,"Shall I take that as a ""yes""?"
809,KATE,809,"Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry
you?"
810,LEOPOLD,810,"I love you, Kate."
811,KATE,811,"That's entirely beside the point...
You're moving way too fast here.
Shouldn't we date first? I mean it's
obvious the first one went well..."
812,LEOPOLD,812,"Where I come from that's pretty much
the way it works."
813,KATE,813,"Leopold, even though last night we...
loved each other, that doesn't mean
this morning we're engaged. It just
doesn't work that way now."
814,LEOPOLD,814,"I have loved you since I first set
eyes on you. I cannot imagine my
life without you beside me. I want
to marry you, Kate and make an honest
woman of you."
815,KATE,815,"Oh Leopold, sit down."
816,KATE,816,"Relationships these days are much
more complicated than that. Women
today have certain freedoms that men
have been taking advantage of for
centuries. You must have been aware
of that. If you think about it
clearly, it should be obvious to you
that marriage between us is out of
the question."
817,LEOPOLD,817,Do you not love me Kate?
818,KATE,818,Don't ever think that...
819,LEOPOLD,819,Then consider my proposal.
820,KATE,820,"I'll think it over but I can tell
you now the answer is..."
821,KATE,821,Possibly.
822,LEOPOLD,822,"I need you beside me. I will not
give up easily."
823,KATE,823,Do what you have to do...
824,CHARLIE,824,Morning.
825,LEOPOLD AND KATE,825,Morning!
826,LEOPOLD,826,Coffee?
827,CHARLIE,827,I would like some coffee.
828,KATE,828,Of course. Say when.
829,CHARLIE,829,When.
830,KATE,830,Sorry.
831,CHARLIE,831,Uh huh.
832,DR. KAY,832,"Kate, are you all right?"
833,KATE,833,Fine! I'm fine.
834,LEOPOLD,834,"Public office is apparently still
the last refuge for the incompetent.
Show me a man who does not want his
gun registered and I'll show you a
man who should not own a gun. What
is a pee-pee girl?"
835,KATE,835,What are you reading?
836,LEOPOLD,836,"The Village Voice. After much
consideration, I have decided it is
time I join the work force."
837,KATE,837,As a pee-pee girl?
838,LEOPOLD,838,"Perhaps not that, but I am determined
to acquire honest employment."
839,KATE,839,"Leopold, I don't know if that's such
a good idea."
840,LEOPOLD,840,"Kate, my life back home was beneficial
to no one. I want my new life to
have value. I won't make the same
mistakes twice."
841,KATE,841,You have to be patient.
842,LEOPOLD,842,"I could conceivably wait my whole
life away."
843,KATE,843,"You're awfully cute when you get
causey."
844,LEOPOLD,844,"I will not waste any more time. I
must make a difference."
845,LEOPOLD,845,"Try our fragrance? Would you like to
try our new fragrance today?"
846,RICH CUSTOMER,846,What is it?
847,LEOPOLD,847,"It is called, POISON."
848,RICH CUSTOMER,848,"Oh! I don't think so. Have you got
PASSION?"
849,LEOPOLD,849,I beg your pardon?
850,RICH CUSTOMER,850,Elizabeth Taylor's Passion?
851,LEOPOLD,851,Next aisle over.
852,LEOPOLD,852,"Give your mother-in-law what she
really deserves this season. Give
her some POISON."
853,KATE,853,Hi.
854,KATE,854,What's the matter?
855,KATE,855,So you know.
856,DR. KAU,856,"We had to go through your computer
to access information. Your
calculations have been verified and
the final course has been set. Leopold
goes back a week from Friday 1:17
a.m."
857,DR. PLODDER,857,"How long were you going to keep it a
secret, Kate?"
858,DR. DRAKE,858,"Were you even going to tell us at
all?"
859,KATE,859,I'm not sure.
860,DR. PLODDER,860,"Not sure? What can you be thinking?
You can't alter the course of history
and assume everything will be okay.
It won't be. He has his own destiny
to fulfill in his own time."
861,KATE,861,You don't understand.
862,DR. DRAKE,862,"He's going back, Kate."
863,DR. PLODDER,863,It's over.
864,KATE,864,"No... No, no, no."
865,CHARLIE,865,"There you are. I've only been
hollering for the last..."
866,CHARLIE,866,Kate? What is it? What happened?
867,KATE,867,It's time. Leopold's going back.
868,CHARLIE,868,Kate...
869,KATE,869,"Yup. I'll get his things together.
Tell him tonight."
870,CHARLIE,870,Are you all right?
871,KATE,871,I'm fine.
872,CHARLIE,872,You don't look so fine.
873,KATE,873,"Well I am. It was wonderful having
him here, Charlie. He was of
invaluable assistance to the project."
874,KATE,874,I'll miss him.
875,CHARLIE,875,You'll miss him?
876,KATE,876,I will.
877,CHARLIE,877,"Goddamnit Kate, you love the guy!"
878,CHARLIE,878,"Kate, don't do this. Please. It's
not right."
879,KATE,879,"What am I supposed to DO, Charlie??
I can't go back. He can't stay. I
can't let him go. I'm not equipped
to deal with this, Charlie. I don't
know how."
880,CHARLIE,880,"Listen to me, Kate. Don't! Don't be
the ice princess."
881,KATE,881,I'm not!
882,CHARLIE,882,"You are. You can't live your whole
life under a microscope. You've got
to tell him how you feel."
883,KATE,883,"It's too much, Charlie. It's just
too much."
884,CHARLIE,884,You owe it to him.
885,KATE,885,"I didn't know I could feel like this.
I really didn't know."
886,LEOPOLD,886,"So I looked him right in the eye and
said, 'Ego is nature's compensation
for mediocrity.' I turned and I
walked. He never said a word... He
probably didn't understand it...
Kate?"
887,KATE,887,What?
888,LEOPOLD,888,"Are you all right? You're awfully
quiet."
889,KATE,889,I'm fine.
890,LEOPOLD,890,How was your day?
891,KATE,891,It's time.
892,KATE,892,We're sending you back.
893,LEOPOLD,893,When?
894,KATE,894,"A week from Friday, early morning."
895,LEOPOLD,895,No!
896,KATE,896,"It was a mistake, Leopold. It's out
of our hands. We can't POCKET people
from history like stolen jewels. We
haven't the right... I'm sorry. We'll
miss you."
897,LEOPOLD,897,Is that all?
898,KATE,898,"What do you want me to do, fall apart?
You'd still be leaving. It wouldn't
solve anything."
899,LEOPOLD,899,"Who is this woman sitting across
from me?"
900,KATE,900,"What do you want me to say, Leopold?"
901,LEOPOLD,901,"Tell me that you love me as I love
you. Let me hear you say it."
902,LEOPOLD,902,I will not do this. I'm sorry.
903,KATE,903,Leopold!
904,LEOPOLD,904,Good God. Look at you. You look awful.
905,KATE,905,You should see what I'm looking at.
906,LEOPOLD,906,"I went back to the restaurant. They
told me you went out looking for me
right after I left."
907,KATE,907,"That was pound cakes ago. Where were
you?"
908,LEOPOLD,908,I had a lot to think over.
909,KATE,909,Such as?
910,LEOPOLD,910,Just where I stand around here.
911,KATE,911,"We should have come up with something
together. I might have been spared
ten or seventy pounds."
912,LEOPOLD,912,Is that an apology?
913,KATE,913,I'm sorry for what I said.
914,LEOPOLD,914,I'm not going anywhere.
915,KATE,915,Yes you are...
916,LEOPOLD,916,"I'm not going. I'm staying here with
you."
917,KATE,917,"But? You can't! We have no right
to..."
918,LEOPOLD,918,It is my destiny. It is my decision.
919,KATE,919,"Have you thought about what you'd be
sacrificing? Your influence? Your
authority?"
920,KATE,920,"Your family, your whole way of life,
everything?"
921,KATE,921,"You're not just feeling sorry for me
because I ate the contents of the
refrigerator, are you?"
922,LEOPOLD,922,"I love you, Kate. The single most
miraculous event in my life was not
how I arrived here, but that when I
did, I found you."
923,KATE,923,Here comes the mushy part!
924,LEOPOLD,924,"After much consideration I've come
to the conclusion I no longer desire
a large estate with a full staff and
ornate grounds."
925,KATE,925,"That's good, because if you're staying
I'll probably get fired again. What
do you desire?"
926,LEOPOLD,926,"A beautiful wife, a small home in
the middle of nowhere, lots of
children, and fine schools with PMS
meetings every other Sunday."
927,KATE,927,...PTA?
928,LEOPOLD,928,PTA.
929,KATE,929,"I love you too. I do, Leopold. I
love you, too."
930,DR. PLODDER,930,"This is outrageous! I won't allow
it!"
931,LEOPOLD,931,The decision is not yours to make.
932,DR. PLODDER,932,"Do you realize what you're saying?
You're tampering with fate,
preordinance, and God himself."
933,LEOPOLD,933,"We do that every day, doctor. It is
called CHOICE."
934,DR. KAU,934,"Dr. Carlson is still over there. You
can't simply abandon her. We have to
get her back."
935,KATE,935,"Do you think I'm not aware of that?
Do you think a minute goes by that I
don't feel responsible for her? But
SOMEONE ELSE CAN GO."
936,DR. KAU,936,"Only one person can return. The
capsule accommodates only one person.
Leopold has to find her."
937,LEOPOLD,937,"Perhaps she does not wish to return.
Perhaps she's found greater happiness
in her new life. It happened to me."
938,KATE,938,"Maybe this is her destiny. Maybe
she's of more important use back
there."
939,DR. KAU,939,"Julia Carlson died in the Center
Factory fire of 1897, two years after
she arrived. She was 37 years old."
940,DR. DRAKE,940,Dear lord.
941,DR. KAU,941,"She was a friend, Kate. She was never
expected to sacrifice her life for
this experiment. I won't be a party
to it. I know what I'm asking...
There's no way we can force you to
go. Just think it over."
942,KATE,942,You're going back aren't you?
943,LEOPOLD,943,"I keep seeing that poor woman's face.
She was terrified."
944,KATE,944,"You said you wouldn't leave me...
I've never been lucky. Not one time."
945,LEOPOLD,945,"Six months ago I wouldn't have given
it another thought. I wouldn't have
lost a moment's sleep. You've changed
me, Kate. There is no turning back."
946,KATE,946,"I wouldn't WANT you to change. That's
what's tearing me up inside. Either
way I lose... You've changed me too.
I can't go back to my old life
anymore. I can't live like that again.
God my heart is pounding like a drum.
I've never been so scared in my life.
Take me with you, Leopold. God. Take
me with you."
947,LEOPOLD,947,"You don't realize what you're saying!
You don't understand the kind of
life you'd lead. What you'd be giving
up."
948,KATE,948,I'd be with you.
949,LEOPOLD,949,I can't ask that of you.
950,KATE,950,Just ask me... Just ask.
951,LEOPOLD,951,Come back with me.
952,KATE,952,Yes!
953,KATE,953,Where are you taking me?
954,LEOPOLD,954,"This is something I've wanted to do
for a long time."
955,KATE,955,Leopold?
956,LEOPOLD,956,This will be very therapeutic.
957,DR. DRAKE,957,"The time tables have been set. Just
strap yourself in and you'll be fine."
958,DR. PLODDER,958,"You have only a twenty four hour
leeway before the machine is set to
return to us. You must find Carlson
within that time frame and get her
on board or there will be little
chance of her finding a way back."
959,LEOPOLD,959,I understand.
960,DR. DRAKE,960,"It's been a real pleasure. You have
a much nicer smile than Ronald
Coleman."
961,LEOPOLD,961,The privilege was mine.
962,DR. KAU,962,"Goodbye Leopold, and thank you."
963,LEOPOLD,963,"Oh, my."
964,DR. KAU,964,"Don't worry. We'll send Kate to you...
as soon as possible. I'll see to it
myself."
965,LEOPOLD,965,See that you do.
966,DR. KAU,966,You have my word on it.
967,DR. DRAKE,967,Four minutes and counting.
968,CHARLIE,968,Well? I'll make this quick. Goodbye.
969,LEOPOLD,969,Goodbye.
970,LEOPOLD,970,"I shall miss you Charles, more than
you know."
971,CHARLIE,971,"I'll miss you too, Leopold... You're
the only one who knows how to program
the VCR... Take care of my sister."
972,LEOPOLD,972,I will.
973,CARLSON,973,"You better. Take care of yourself
too while you're at it... So long."
974,KATE,974,I don't have any words for this.
975,LEOPOLD,975,I will see you soon.
976,KATE,976,I know.
977,LEOPOLD,977,You'll be with me all the time.
978,KATE,978,I know. I brought you something.
979,KATE,979,So you wouldn't forget me.
980,LEOPOLD,980,Kate...
981,KATE,981,"So you wouldn't think this was all a
dream."
982,KATE,982,Don't forget about me.
983,LEOPOLD,983,"I love you, Kate."
984,KATE,984,Wait for me.
985,LEOPOLD,985,For as long as it takes.
986,KATE,986,I will come back to you! I will!
987,LEOPOLD,987,I'll be waiting.
988,DR. DRAKE,988,It's time Leopold.
989,DR. PLODDER,989,9 8 7 6 5 4...
990,DR. PLODDER,990,3 2 1!
991,DR. PLODDER,991,"I cannot in good conscience let you
go. It's out of the question."
992,DR. DRAKE,992,"I can't be a part of it either Kate.
I'm sorry."
993,DR. KAU,993,It's too big a risk.
994,DR. PLODDER,994,"We cannot guarantee your child's
safety. It's that simple."
995,KATE,995,"He's waiting for me. I can feel it.
Oh, Leopold..."
996,CARLSON,996,Hi. Does Katherine Coles live here?
997,LEO,997,Yeah.
998,LEO,998,MOM??
999,CARLSON,999,"You're Leo aren't you? You don't
remember me but I knew you when you
were yea big."
1000,LEO,1000,Yeah.
1001,CARLSON,1001,"I'm Julia. I'm an old friend of your
mothers."
1002,LEO,1002,"We had spaghetti at our house 4 times
this week."
1003,KATE,1003,"Leo you don't have to holler like
that. I'm not deaf..."
1004,CARLSON,1004,Kate?
1005,KATE,1005,...Carlson?!
1006,KATE,1006,"Carlson, I don't believe it. It's
been... I don't know how many years.
What are you doing here."
1007,CARLSON,1007,"I came to see you, sweetie."
1008,KATE,1008,"You remember my son, Leo?"
1009,CARLSON,1009,We've just been getting acquainted.
1010,KATE,1010,"Well, come inside. Come inside."
1011,KATE,1011,"Would you like some tea? I wish you
had called before you come over. It
would have given me a chance to
straighten up the house... myself...
my life. Tell me what you've been up
to. Catch me up on everyone. I heard
you received some big endowment or
something. I was going to write,
then call, but..."
1012,CARLSON,1012,"It's all right, Kate. I understand."
1013,CARLSON,1013,"You'd leave in 9 days. That's not a
lot of time to get your affairs in
order... And I warn you, it's nearly
impossible for an intelligent woman
back there."
1014,CARLSON,1014,"He's a fine boy Kate. Leopold would
be proud. We're aware of your
situation but we felt when the time
came, you deserved the option."
1015,LEO,1015,Who was that lady?
1016,KATE,1016,Just an old friend.
1017,LEO,1017,What she want?
1018,KATE,1018,"Nothing important. You brush your
teeth?"
1019,KATE,1019,"Then give your old mom a hug and go
to bed."
1020,KATE,1020,"Good night, cookie."
1021,LEO,1021,Good night.
1022,KATE,1022,"He's so YOUNG, Charlie."
1023,CHARLIE,1023,He's old enough.
1024,KATE,1024,"Look at that idiotic expression on
his face."
1025,CHARLIE,1025,He's happy.
1026,KATE,1026,"Of course he's happy. All weddings
are happy. It's the living together
afterwards that causes all the
trouble."
1027,KATE,1027,"Oh, you're so young... I love you,
Leo. Always remember that..."
1028,LEO,1028,"Mom, we're only moving to Denver."
1029,KATE,1029,"I know, cookie. I know."
1030,KATE,1030,Well...
1031,CHARLIE,1031,I know. Me too.
1032,KATE,1032,"What will I do without you, Charlie?"
1033,CHARLIE,1033,Live happily ever after.
1034,CARLSON,1034,"Kate, it's time."
1035,LEO,1035,"Here. It's a letter for my father.
Tell him about me and... um, tell
him I love him. I want him to know
me."
1036,KATE,1036,Leo...
1037,LEO,1037,"Mom, I want you to go."
1038,KATE,1038,But...
1039,LEO,1039,Go.
1040,CARLSON,1040,Ready!
1041,CARLSON,1041,"9, 8, 7..."
1042,CARLSON,1042,"3, 2, 1!"
1043,FLIRT,1043,"I just love a starched white shirt.
It's so elegant."
1044,LEOPOLD,1044,Thank you.
1045,FLIRT,1045,Skeeky.
1046,LEOPOLD,1046,"Yes. You dance like an angel Miss
Beall. You light up the room around
you. I thank you."
1047,FLIRT,1047,Thank YOU.
1048,LORD WHITEHEAD,1048,Who is that dancing with Leopold?
1049,LADY WHITEHEAD,1049,I've never seen her before.
