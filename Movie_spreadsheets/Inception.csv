0,ATTENDANT,0,"He was delirious. But he asked for
you by name. And..."
1,ATTENDANT,1,Show him.
2,SECURITY GUARD,2,He was carrying nothing but this...
3,SECURITY GUARD,3,...and this.
4,ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN,4,Bring him here. And some food.
5,ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN,5,Are you here to kill me?
6,ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN,6,I know what this is.
7,ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN,7,"I've seen one before. Many, many
years ago..."
8,ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN,8,"It belonged to a man I met in a
half-remembered dream..."
9,ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN,9,"A man possessed of some radical
notions..."
10,COBB (V.O.),10,What's the most resilient parasite?
11,COBB,11,A bacteria? A virus?
12,COBB,12,An intestinal worm?
13,ARTHUR,13,What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-
14,COBB,14,An idea.
15,COBB,15,"Resilient, highly contagious. Once
an idea's taken hold in the brain
it's almost impossible to
eradicate. A person can cover it
up, ignore it- but it stays there."
16,SAITO,16,But surely-to forget...?
17,COBB,17,"Information, yes. But an idea?
Fully formed, understood? That
sticks..."
18,COBB,18,"In there, somewhere."
19,SAITO,19,For someone like you to steal?
20,ARTHUR,20,"Yes. In the dream state, conscious
defenses are lowered and your
thoughts become vulnerable to
theft. It's called extraction."
21,COBB,21,"But, Mr. Saito, we can train your
subconscious to defend itself from
even the most skilled extractor."
22,SAITO,22,How can you do that?
23,COBB,23,"Because I am the most skilled
extractor. I know how to search
your mind and find your secrets. I
know the tricks, and I can teach
them to your subconscious so that
even when you're asleep, your guard
is never down."
24,COBB,24,"But if I'm going to help you, you
have to be completely open to me.
I'll need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your
wife, your analyst, anyone."
25,COBB,25,"If this is a dream and you've got a
safe full of secrets, I need to
know what's in that safe. For this
to work, you have to let me in."
26,SAITO,26,"Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I
consider your proposal."
27,ARTHUR,27,He knows.
28,ARTHUR,28,What's going on up there?
29,ARTHUR,29,Saito knows. He's playing with us.
30,COBB,30,"I can get it here. The
information's in the safe- he
looked right at it when I mentioned
secrets."
31,ARTHUR,31,"What's she doing here, Cobb?"
32,COBB,32,"You just get to your room. I'll
take care of the rest."
33,ARTHUR,33,"See that you do. We're here to
work."
34,MAL,34,"If I jumped, would I survive?"
35,COBB,35,"With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,
why are you here?"
36,MAL,36,"I thought you might be missing
me..."
37,COBB,37,"I am. But I can't trust you
anymore."
38,MAL,38,So what?
39,MAL,39,Looks like Arthur's taste.
40,COBB,40,"Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to
postwar British painters."
41,COBB,41,Would you sit down?
42,MAL,42,Tell me...
43,MAL,43,Do the children miss me?
44,COBB,44,You can't imagine.
45,MAL,45,What're you doing?
46,COBB,46,Getting some air.
47,COBB,47,Stay seated. Please.
48,SAITO (O.S.),48,Turn around.
49,MAL,49,"The gun, Dom."
50,MAL,50,Please.
51,SAITO,51,"Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb."
52,COBB,52,"Did she tell you, or have you known
all along?"
53,SAITO,53,That you're here to steal from me?
54,SAITO,54,Or that we're actually asleep?
55,SAITO,55,"I want to know who your employer
is."
56,COBB,56,"No point threatening him in a
dream."
57,MAL,57,"That depends on what you're
threatening. Killing him would just
wake him up... but pain? Pain is in
the mind..."
58,MAL,58,"And, judging by the decor, we're in
your mind, aren't we, Arthur?"
59,NASH,59,What're you doing?! It's too soon-
60,ARTHUR,60,"I know! We have to reconnect the
loop before they wake up!"
61,MAL,61,He was close. Very close.
62,SAITO,62,Stop him!
63,ARTHUR,63,"I'm not going to make it! Wake
Cobb!"
64,NASH,64,He won't wake!
65,ARTHUR,65,Dunk him!
66,COBB,66,You came prepared.
67,SAITO,67,"I bring the gun because not even my
head of security knows this
apartment. How did you find it?"
68,COBB,68,"Hard for a man in your position to
keep a love nest totally secret...
particularly when there's a married
woman involved."
69,SAITO,69,She would never...
70,COBB,70,"And yet, here we are."
71,COBB,71,With a dilemma.
72,SAITO,72,You got what you came for.
73,COBB,73,"Not quite. The key piece of
information wasn't there, was it,
Mr. Saito?"
74,ARTHUR,74,"They're getting closer, Cobb."
75,COBB,75,"You held something back because you
knew what we were up to..."
76,COBB,76,So why let us in at all?
77,SAITO,77,An audition.
78,COBB,78,Audition for what?
79,SAITO,79,It doesn't matter. You failed.
80,COBB,80,"I extracted all the information you
had in there."
81,SAITO,81,"But your deception was readily
apparent."
82,SAITO,82,So leave me and go.
83,COBB,83,"You know the corporation who hired
us won't accept failure. We won't
last two days..."
84,ARTHUR,84,"Come on, Cobb."
85,COBB,85,"So now I have to do this the old-
fashioned way-"
86,SAITO,86,I've always hated this carpet.
87,SAITO,87,"It's stained and frayed in such
distinctive ways..."
88,SAITO,88,"But very definitely made of wool.
Right now I'm lying on polyester."
89,SAITO,89,"Which means I'm not lying on my
carpet, in my apartment..."
90,SAITO,90,"You've lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb... I'm still dreaming."
91,TODASHI,91,How'd it go?
92,ARTHUR,92,Not good.
93,SAITO,93,"A dream within a dream-I'm
impressed."
94,SAITO,94,"But in my dream, we really ought to
be playing by my rules..."
95,NASH,95,"Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito-"
96,COBB,96,We're not in your dream-
97,NASH,97,We're in mine.
98,ARTHUR (O.S.),98,Asshole!
99,ARTHUR,99,"How could you get the carpet
wrong?!"
100,NASH,100,It wasn't my fault!
101,ARTHUR,101,You're the architect-
102,NASH,102,"I didn't know he was going to rub
his damn cheek on it!"
103,COBB,103,Lets go.
104,ARTHUR,104,And you-what the hell was all that?
105,COBB,105,I had it under control.
106,ARTHUR,106,I'd hate to see out of control-
107,COBB,107,"There's no time for this-I'm
getting off at Kyoto."
108,ARTHUR,108,"Why? He's not gonna search every
compartment."
109,COBB,109,I can't stand trains.
110,ARTHUR,110,I can keep him under for one minute-
111,COBB,111,Every man for himself.
112,CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone),112,"Hi, Daddy! Hi, Dad."
113,COBB,113,"Hey, guys. How are you?"
114,CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone),114,"Good. Okay, I guess."
115,COBB,115,Who's just okay? Was that James?
116,JAMES (over phone),116,Yeah. When are you coming home?
117,COBB,117,I can't. Not for a while.
118,JAMES (over phone),118,Why?
119,COBB,119,"Well, James, like I've told you-I'm
away because I'm working..."
120,LITTLE GIRL (over phone),120,"Grandma says you're never coming
back."
121,COBB,121,"Philippa, can you ask Grandma to
pick up the phone-"
122,PHILIPPA (over phone),122,She's shaking her head.
123,COBB,123,"Well, we'll just have to hope
Grandma's wrong about that won't
we?"
124,JAMES,124,Daddy?
125,COBB,125,Yes?
126,JAMES (over phone),126,Is Mommy with you?
127,COBB,127,"No. No, we talked about this,
James. Mommy's gone."
128,JAMES (over phone),128,Where?
129,GRANDMA'S VOICE (over phone),129,"Time to go, kids. Say bye-bye-"
130,COBB,130,"I'll give some presents to Grandpa,
okay? Just be good for-"
131,ARTHUR,131,Our ride's on the roof.
132,ARTHUR,132,Cobb... are you okay?
133,COBB,133,"Yeah, why?"
134,ARTHUR,134,"Down in the dream... Mal showing up
like that ..."
135,COBB,135,Yeah. I'm sorry about your leg.
136,ARTHUR,136,"It's getting worse, isn't it?"
137,COBB,137,"One apology's all you're getting,
Arthur. Now, where's Nash?"
138,ARTHUR,138,Hasn't shown. Wanna wait?
139,COBB,139,"We were supposed to deliver Saito's
expansion plans to Cobol Engineering
two hours ago. By now they know we
failed. Time to disappear."
140,ARTHUR,140,Where will you go?
141,COBB,141,"Buenos Aires. I can lie low there.
Maybe sniff out a job when things
quiet down. You?"
142,ARTHUR,142,Stateside.
143,COBB,143,'Course. Send my regards.
144,SAITO,144,"He sold you out. Thought to come to
me and bargain for his life..."
145,SAITO,145,So I offer you the satisfaction.
146,COBB,146,That's not how I deal with things.
147,SAITO,147,Would you work with him again?
148,COBB,148,What will you do to him?
149,SAITO,149,"Nothing. But I can't speak for your
friends from Cobol Engineering."
150,COBB,150,What do you want from us?
151,SAITO,151,Inception.
152,SAITO,152,Is it possible?
153,ARTHUR,153,Of course not.
154,SAITO,154,"If you can steal an idea from
someone's mind, why can't you plant
one there instead?"
155,ARTHUR,155,"Okay, here's planting an idea: I
say to you, ""Don't think about
elephants."""
156,ARTHUR (CONT'D),156,What are you thinking about?
157,SAITO,157,Elephants.
158,ARTHUR,158,"Right. But it's not your idea
because you know I gave it to you."
159,SAITO,159,You could plant it subconsciously-
160,ARTHUR,160,"The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea. True
inspiration is impossible to fake."
161,COBB,161,"No, it isn't."
162,SAITO,162,Can you do it?
163,COBB,163,I won't do it.
164,SAITO,164,"In exchange, I'll give you the
information you were paid to steal."
165,COBB,165,"Are you giving me a choice? Because
I can find my own way to square
things with Cobol."
166,SAITO,166,Then you do have a choice.
167,COBB,167,And I choose to leave.
168,SAITO,168,"Tell the crew where you want to go,
they'll file the plan en route."
169,SAITO,169,"Mr. Cobb...? There is one other
thing I could offer you."
170,SAITO,170,"How would you like to go home? To
America. To your children."
171,COBB,171,You can't fix that. Nobody could.
172,SAITO,172,Just like inception.
173,ARTHUR,173,"Cobb, come on-"
174,COBB,174,How complex is the idea?
175,SAITO,175,Simple enough.
176,COBB,176,"No idea's simple when you have to
plant it in someone else's mind."
177,SAITO,177,"My main competitor is an old man in
poor health. His son will soon
inherit control of the corporation.
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire. Against his
own self-interest."
178,ARTHUR,178,"Cobb, we should walk away from
this."
179,COBB,179,"If I were to do it. If I could do
it... how do I know you can
deliver?"
180,SAITO,180,"You don't. But I can. So do you
want to take a leap of faith, or
become an old man, filled with
regret, waiting to die alone?"
181,SAITO,181,"Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And
choose your people more wisely."
182,ARTHUR,182,I know how much you want to go home-
183,COBB,183,"No, you don't."
184,ARTHUR,184,But this can't be done.
185,COBB,185,"It can. You just have to go deep
enough."
186,ARTHUR,186,You don't know that!-
187,COBB,187,I've done it before.
188,ARTHUR,188,Did it work?
189,COBB,189,Yes.
190,ARTHUR,190,Who did you do it to?
191,ARTHUR,191,So why are we headed to Paris?
192,COBB,192,"We're going to need a new
architect."
193,COBB (O.S.),193,You never did like your office.
194,MILES,194,"No space to think in that broom
cupboard."
195,MILES,195,Is it safe for you to be here?
196,COBB,196,"Extradition between France and the
U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare."
197,MILES,197,"I think they'd find a way to make
it work in your case."
198,COBB,198,"Can you take these back for the
kids?"
199,MILES,199,"It'll take more than the occasional
stuffed animal to convince those
children they still have a father."
200,COBB,200,"I know. I thought you could talk to
Marie about bringing them on
vacation. Somewhere I could meet-"
201,MILES,201,Why would she listen to me?
202,COBB,202,You were married for twenty years.
203,MILES,203,She blames me as much as you.
204,COBB,204,"Doesn't she understand that my kids
need me?"
205,MILES,205,"Yes, she does. We all do. Go back
and face the music, Dom. Explain
what Mal did."
206,COBB,206,"Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never
understand- they'd lock me up and
throwaway the key. Or worse."
207,MILES,207,"You think what you're doing now is
helping your case?"
208,COBB,208,"Lawyers don't pay for themselves.
This is what I have. This is what
you taught me."
209,MILES,209,I never taught you to be a thief.
210,COBB,210,"No, you taught me to navigate other
people's minds. But after what
happened with Mal there weren't a
whole lot of legitimate ways for me
to use that skill."
211,MILES,211,"Why did you come here, Dom?"
212,COBB,212,"I found a way home. A job. For
powerful people. If I pull it off,
I can get back to my family. But I
need help."
213,MILES,213,"My God. You're here to corrupt one
of my brightest and best."
214,COBB,214,"If you have someone good enough,
you have to let them decide for
themselves. You know what I'm
offering-"
215,MILES,215,Money?
216,COBB,216,"No, not just money: the chance to
build cathedrals, entire cities-
things that have never existed,
things that couldn't exist in the
real world..."
217,MILES,217,"Everybody dreams, Cobb. Architects
are supposed to make those dreams
real."
218,COBB,218,"That's not what you used to say.
You told me that in the real world
I'd be building attic conversions
and gas stations. You said that if
I mastered the dream-share I'd have
a whole new way of creating and
showing people my creations. You
told me it would free me."
219,MILES,219,And I'm sorry. I was wrong.
220,COBB,220,"No, you weren't. Your vision was a
vision of pure creativity. It's
where we took it that was wrong."
221,MILES,221,"And now you want me to let someone
else follow you into fantasy."
222,COBB,222,"They won't actually come on the
job, they'll just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers."
223,MILES,223,Design them yourself.
224,COBB,224,Mal won't let me.
225,MILES,225,"Come back to reality, Dom. Please."
226,COBB,226,"You want to know what's real,
Stephen? Your grandchildren waiting
for their dad to come back."
227,COBB (CONT'D),227,"This job-this last job-is how I get
there."
228,COBB,228,"I wouldn't be standing here if
there were any other way. I can get
home. But I need an architect who's
as good as I was."
229,MILES,229,I've got someone better.
230,MILES,230,Ariadne...
231,MILES,231,I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
232,ARIADNE,232,Pleased to meet you.
233,MILES,233,"If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb
has a job offer to discuss with
you."
234,ARIADNE,234,A work placement?
235,COBB,235,Not exactly.
236,COBB,236,A test.
237,ARIADNE,237,"Aren't you going to tell me
anything?"
238,COBB,238,"Before I describe the job, I have
to know you could do it."
239,ARIADNE,239,Why?
240,COBB,240,"It's not, strictly speaking, legal."
241,COBB,241,"You have two minutes to draw a maze
that takes me one minute to solve."
242,COBB,242,Go.
243,COBB,243,Stop.
244,COBB,244,Again.
245,COBB,245,Stop.
246,COBB,246,You'll have to-
247,COBB,247,More like it.
248,COBB,248,"They say we only use a fraction of
the true potential of our brains...
but they're talking about when
we're awake. While we dream, the
mind performs wonders."
249,ARIADNE,249,Such as?
250,COBB,250,"How do you imagine a building? You
consciously create each aspect,
puzzling over it in stages... But
sometimes, when your imagination
flies-"
251,ARIADNE,251,I'm discovering it.
252,COBB,252,Exactly. Genuine inspiration.
253,COBB,253,"In a dream your mind continuously
does that..."
254,COBB,254,"It creates and perceives a world
simultaneously. So well that you
don't feel your brain doing the
creating. That's why we can short-
circuit the process..."
255,ARIADNE,255,How?
256,COBB,256,By taking over the creating part.
257,COBB,257,"This is where you come in. You
build the world of the dream. We
take the subject into that dream,
and let him £111 it with his
subconscious"
258,ARIADNE,258,"But are you trying to fool him that
the dream is actually real life?"
259,COBB,259,"While we're in there, We don't want
him to realize he's dreaming."
260,ARIADNE,260,"How could I ever get enough detail
to Convince him that it's real?"
261,COBB,261,"Our dreams reel real while we're in
them. It's only when we wake up we
realize things were strange,"
262,ARIADNE,262,"But all the textures of real life-
the stone, the fabric. cars...
people... your mind can't create
all this."
263,COBB,263,"It does. Every time you dream. Let
me ask you a question: You never
remember the beginning of your
dreams, do you? You just turn up in
the middle of what's going on."
264,ARIADNE,264,I guess.
265,COBB,265,"So... how did we end up at this
restaurant?"
266,ARIADNE,266,We came here from...
267,COBB,267,How did we get here? Where are we?
268,ARIADNE,268,Oh my God. We're dreaming.
269,COBB,269,"Stay calm. We're actually asleep in
the workshop. This is your first
lesson in shared dreaming,
remember?"
270,ARIADNE,270,"If it's just a dream, why are you
covering your-"
271,COBB (O.S.),271,Because it's never just a dream.
272,COBB,272,"And a face full of glass hurts like
hell, doesn't it? While we're in
it, it's real."
273,ARTHUR,273,"That's why the military developed
dream sharing-a training program
where soldiers could strangle, stab
and shoot each other, then wake up."
274,ARIADNE,274,How did architects get involved?
275,COBB,275,Someone had to design the dreams.
276,COBB,276,Let's go another five minutes-
277,ARIADNE,277,"We were only asleep for five
minutes? We talked for an hour at
least..."
278,COBB,278,"When you dream, your mind functions
more quickly, so time seems to pass
more slowly."
279,ARTHUR,279,"Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream."
280,COBB,280,"Let's see how much trouble you can
cause in five minutes."
281,COBB,281,"It's good. You've got the cafe, the
layout... you forgot the book shop
but pretty much everything else is
here."
282,ARIADNE,282,Who are the people?
283,COBB,283,"They're projections of my
subconscious."
284,ARIADNE,284,Yours?
285,COBB,285,"Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the
subject. My subconscious populates
your world. That's one way we get
at a subject's thoughts-his mind
creates the people, so we can
literally talk to his subconscious."
286,ARIADNE,286,How else do you do it?
287,COBB,287,"Architecture. Build a bank vault or
a jail, something secure, and the
subject's mind will fill it with
information he's trying to protect."
288,ARIADNE,288,Then you break in and steal it.
289,COBB,289,Exactly.
290,ARIADNE,290,I love the concrete sense of things-
291,ARIADNE,291,"Real weight, you know? I thought a
dream space would be all about the
visual, but it's the feel of
things. Question is, what happens
as you start to mess with
physics..."
292,ARIADNE,292,"It's something, isn't it?"
293,COBB,293,Yes. It is.
294,ARIADNE,294,Why are they looking at me?
295,COBB,295,"Because you're changing things. My
subconscious feels that someone
else is creating the world. The
more you change things, the quicker
the projections converge on you."
296,ARIADNE,296,Converge?
297,COBB,297,"They feel the foreign nature of the
dreamer, and attack-like white
blood cells fighting an infection."
298,ARIADNE,298,They're going to attack us?
299,COBB,299,"Just you, actually."
300,COBB,300,"It's beautiful... but if you keep
on changing things..."
301,ARIADNE,301,"Mind telling your subconscious to
take it easy?"
302,COBB,302,"That's why it's called subconscious.
I don't control it."
303,COBB,303,"Arched stone, iron pillars...
it's..."
304,COBB,304,"I know this bridge. This place is
real-"
305,COBB,305,"You didn't imagine it, you
remembered it..."
306,ARIADNE,306,"I cross it every day on my way to
the college."
307,COBB,307,"Never recreate places from your
memory. Always imagine new places."
308,ARIADNE,308,You have to draw from what you know-
309,COBB,309,"Use pieces-a streetlamp,
phonebooths, a type of brick-not
whole areas."
310,ARIADNE,310,Why not?
311,COBB,311,"Because building dreams out of your
own memories is the surest way to
lose your grip on what's real and
what's a dream."
312,ARIADNE,312,Did that happen to you?
313,COBB,313,"Look, this isn't about me-"
314,ARIADNE,314,"Is that why you need me to build
your dreams?"
315,COBB,315,Leave her alone-
316,ARIADNE,316,"Wake me up, Cobb."
317,COBB,317,"Mal, no!"
318,ARIADNE,318,Wake me up!
319,ARTHUR,319,It's okay.
320,ARIADNE,320,Why couldn't I wake?
321,ARTHUR,321,"The only way to wake from inside
the dream is to die."
322,COBB,322,She'll need a totem.
323,ARIADNE,323,What?
324,ARTHUR,324,"Some kind of personal icon. A small
object that you can always have
with you, and that no one else
knows,"
325,ARIADNE,325,"That's some subconscious you've
got, Cobb."
326,ARIADNE,326,She's a real charmer!
327,ARTHUR,327,Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.
328,ARIADNE,328,She's his wife?
329,ARTHUR,329,"So. A totem. You need something
small, potentially heavy..."
330,ARIADNE,330,Like a coin?
331,ARTHUR,331,"Too common. You need something that
has a weight or movement that only
you know."
332,ARIADNE,332,What's yours?
333,ARTHUR,333,A loaded die.
334,ARTHUR,334,"I can't let you handle it. That's
the point. No one else can know the
weight or balance of it."
335,ARIADNE,335,Why?
336,ARTHUR,336,So when you examine your totem...
337,ARTHUR (O.S.),337,"You know, beyond a doubt, that
you're not in someone else's dream."
338,ARIADNE,338,That's not an issue for me.
339,ARTHUR,339,Why not?
340,ARIADNE,340,"Arthur, maybe you can't see what's
going on, maybe you don't want to.
But Cobb's got problems he's tried
to bury down there. I'm not going
to open my mind to someone like
that."
341,COBB (O.S.),341,She'll be back.
342,COBB,342,"I've never seen anyone pick it up
so fast. And one reality won't be
enough for her now. When she comes
back, get her building mazes."
343,ARTHUR,343,Where will you be?
344,COBB,344,I've got to talk to Eames.
345,ARTHUR,345,"Eames? But he's in Mombasa. Cobol's
backyard."
346,COBB,346,Necessary risk.
347,ARTHUR,347,There are plenty of other thieves.
348,COBB,348,"We don't just need a thief. We need
a forger."
349,COBB (O.S.),349,"Rub them against each other all you
like, they're not going to breed."
350,EAMES,350,You never know.
351,COBB,351,Drink?
352,EAMES,352,You're buying.
353,COBB,353,You're spelling hasn't improved.
354,EAMES,354,Piss off.
355,COBB,355,How's your handwriting?
356,EAMES,356,Versatile.
357,EAMES,357,"Word is, you're not welcome in
these parts."
358,COBB,358,Yeah?
359,EAMES,359,"There's a price on your head from
Cobol Engineering. Pretty big one,
actually."
360,COBB,360,You wouldn't sell me out.
361,EAMES,361,`Course I would.
362,COBB,362,Not when you hear what I'm selling.
363,COBB,363,Inception.
364,COBB,364,"Don't bother telling me it's
impossible."
365,EAMES,365,"It's perfectly possible. Just
bloody difficult."
366,COBB,366,"That's what I keep saying to
Arthur."
367,EAMES,367,"There's a man here. Yusuf. He
formulates his own versions of the
compounds."
368,COBB,368,Let's go see him.
369,EAMES,369,Once you've lost your tail.
370,EAMES,370,"Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in
about two minutes after we did."
371,COBB,371,Cobol Engineering?
372,EAMES,372,They pretty much own Mombasa.
373,COBB,373,"Run interference. We'll meet
downstairs in half an hour."
374,EAMES,374,Back here?
375,COBB,375,Last place they'd expect.
376,EAMES,376,Freddy!
377,EAMES,377,"Freddy Simmonds, it is you!"
378,EAMES,378,"Oh. No, it isn't."
379,COBB,379,Yes?
380,SECOND BUSINESSMAN,380,We need to-
381,SAITO,381,"Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?"
382,COBB,382,"What brings you to Mombasa, Mr.
Saito?"
383,SAITO,383,I have to protect my investment.
384,EAMES,384,This is your idea of losing a tail?
385,COBB,385,Different tail.
386,ARTHUR,386,He said you'd be back.
387,ARIADNE,387,I tried not to come.
388,ARTHUR,388,"But there's nothing else quite like
it."
389,ARIADNE,389,"No paper, no pens... nothing
between you and raw, direct
creation."
390,ARTHUR,390,"Shall we take a look at paradoxical
architecture?"
391,ARTHUR,391,"You're going to have to master a
few tricks if you're going to build
three complete dream levels."
392,ARIADNE,392,What sort of tricks?
393,ARTHUR,393,"In a dream, you can cheat
architecture into impossible
shapes."
394,ARTHUR (CONT'D),394,"That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps. The
infinite staircase."
395,ARTHUR,395,See...
396,ARTHUR,396,"Paradox. A closed loop like this
helps you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you've created."
397,ARIADNE,397,How big do the levels have to be?
398,ARTHUR,398,"Anything from the floor of a
building, to an entire city. But it
has to be complicated enough for us
to hide from the projections."
399,ARIADNE,399,A maze.
400,ARTHUR,400,And the better the maze-
401,ARIADNE,401,"The longer we have before the
projections catch us."
402,ARIADNE,402,"My subconscious seems polite
enough."
403,ARTHUR,403,"You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one
likes to see someone else messing
around in their mind."
404,ARIADNE,404,"Cobb can't build anymore, can he?"
405,ARTHUR,405,"I don't know if he can't, but he
won't. He thinks it's safer if he
doesn't know the layouts."
406,ARIADNE,406,Why?
407,ARTHUR,407,"He won't tell me. I think it's Mal.
I think she's getting stronger."
408,ARIADNE,408,His ex-wife?
409,ARTHUR,409,She's not his ex.
410,ARIADNE,410,They're still together?
411,ARTHUR,411,"No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What
you see in there is just his
projection of her."
412,ARIADNE,412,What was she like in real life?
413,ARTHUR,413,She was lovely.
414,SAITO,414,"Robert Fischer, 32. Heir to the
Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.
He's spent his whole life being
groomed as successor-breaking up
his father's empire will take a
radical shift in his thinking."
415,COBB,415,What's your problem with Fischer?
416,SAITO,416,That's not your concern.
417,COBB,417,"This isn't the usual corporate
espionage, Mr. Saito. This is
inception. The seed of the idea we
plant will grow in this man's mind.
It'll change him. It might even
come to define him."
418,SAITO,418,"My sources suggest you might not
have always been so cautious."
419,COBB,419,"Then you need new sources, Mr.
Saito."
420,SAITO,420,"Fischer Morrow has the regulators
in their pockets. We're the last
company standing between them and
total energy dominance and we can
no longer compete. Soon they'll
control the energy supply of half
the world. They'll be able to
blackmail governments, dictate
policy. In effect, they become a
new superpower. The world needs
Robert Fischer to change his mind."
421,EAMES,421,"That's where we come in. How's
Robert Fischer's relationship to
his father?"
422,SAITO,422,"Rumor is the relationship is
complicated."
423,COBB,423,"We'll need more than rumor, Mr.
Saito."
424,EAMES,424,"Can you get me access to him?
Browning. Fischer senior's right-
hand man. Fischer junior's
godfather."
425,SAITO,425,"It should be possible. If you can
get the right references."
426,EAMES,426,"References are something of a
specialty for me, Mr. Saito."
427,YUSUF,427,"Come, come."
428,YUSUF,428,"Ah, yes. Mr. Cobb. I've heard so
very much about you."
429,YUSUF,429,please.
430,YUSUF,430,Bloody cats.
431,YUSUF,431,"You work using Somnacin, I think,
Mr. Cobb?"
432,COBB,432,"You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf."
433,COBB,433,Somnacin?
434,YUSUF,434,Yusuf's Somnacin.
435,COBB,435,As good as the real thing?
436,YUSUF,436,Better.
437,YUSUF,437,"Binds the dreamers tight. Let's
them dream as one. Makes it real.
Of course, if you'd prefer, you
could use Somnacin brand. If you
could explain to the international
control council what you wanted it
for."
438,YUSUF,438,You are seeking a chemist?
439,YUSUF,439,To formulate compounds for a job?
440,COBB,440,And to come into the held with us.
441,YUSUF,441,"I rarely go into the held, Mr.
Cobb."
442,COBB,442,"We need you there to tailor
compounds to our particular
requirements."
443,YUSUF,443,Which are?
444,COBB,444,Great depth.
445,YUSUF,445,A dream within a dream? Two levels?
446,COBB,446,Three.
447,YUSUF,447,"Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams would be too
unstable."
448,COBB,448,"I've done it before. You just have
to add a sedative."
449,YUSUF,449,"A powerful sedative. How many team
members?"
450,COBB,450,Five.
451,SAITO,451,Six.
452,SAITO,452,"The only way to know you've done
the job is if I go in with you."
453,COBB,453,"There's no room for tourists on
these jobs, Mr. Saito."
454,SAITO,454,"This time, it would seem there is."
455,YUSUF,455,Of course. I use it every day.
456,COBB,456,For what?
457,YUSUF,457,"Perhaps... you will not want to
see."
458,EAMES,458,"Eighteen, twenty-all connected,
bloody hell."
459,YUSUF,459,"They come every day. To share the
dream."
460,YUSUF,460,See? Very stable.
461,COBB,461,How long do they dream?
462,YUSUF,462,"Three, four hours. Every day."
463,COBB,463,How long in dream time?
464,YUSUF,464,"With this compound... about forty
hours. Each and every day."
465,SAITO,465,Why do they do it?
466,YUSUF,466,"Tell him, Mr. Cobb."
467,COBB,467,After a while...
468,COBB,468,"It becomes the only way you can
dream."
469,YUSUF,469,"Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?"
470,EAMES,470,They come here every day to sleep?
471,ELDERLY BALD MAN (O.S.),471,No.
472,ELDERLY BALD MAN,472,"They come to be woken up... the
dream has become their reality..."
473,ELDERLY BALD MAN,473,And who are you to say otherwise?
474,COBB,474,Let's see what you can do.
475,YUSUF,475,"Sharp, no?"
476,SAITO,476,"Everything alright, Mr. Cobb?"
477,COBB,477,Everything's fine.
478,ARIADNE,478,You're back.
479,ARIADNE,479,Are you going under on your own?
480,COBB,480,"I just-I need to test some things.
I didn't realize anyone was here."
481,ARIADNE,481,Just working on my totem.
482,COBB,482,Let me see-
483,COBB,483,You're learning.
484,ARIADNE,484,"It's an elegant solution to keeping
track of reality. Your invention?"
485,COBB,485,No. Mal's.
486,COBB,486,"This one was hers. She'd spin it in
a dream and it would never topple.
Just spin and spin..."
487,ARIADNE,487,Arthur told me she died.
488,COBB,488,She did. How are the mazes coming?
489,ARIADNE,489,"Good. Each level relates to the
part of the subject's subconscious
we're trying to access. I'm making
the bottom level a hospital, so
that Fischer will bring his father
there-"
490,COBB,490,"Don't tell me. Remember, you only
want the dreamer to know the
layout."
491,ARIADNE,491,Why's that so important?
492,COBB,492,"In case one of us brings in part of
our subconscious. You wouldn't want
any projections knowing the layout."
493,ARIADNE,493,In case you bring Mal in.
494,ARIADNE,494,"You won't build yourself because if
you know the maze, then she knows
it. And she'd sabotage the
operation. You can't keep her out,
can you?"
495,ARIADNE,495,Do the others know?
496,COBB,496,No.
497,ARIADNE,497,"You have to warn them if it's
getting worse-"
498,COBB,498,"I didn't say it's getting worse.
Look, Ariadne, I need them for this
job. I need you for this job.
Without your help, I'll never get
back to my children. And that's all
I can care about right now."
499,ARIADNE,499,"Why can't you go home, Cobb?"
500,COBB,500,They think I killed her.
501,ARIADNE,501,How did she die?
502,COBB,502,Thank you.
503,ARIADNE,503,For what?
504,COBB,504,Not asking whether I did.
505,COBB,505,"The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to
the Australian energy conglomerate,
Fischer Morrow."
506,COBB (reads aloud),506,"""I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S
EMPIRE."""
507,COBB,507,"An idea Robert Fischer's conscious
mind would never accept. We have to
plant it deep in his subconscious."
508,ARTHUR,508,How deep?
509,COBB,509,Three levels down.
510,ARTHUR,510,"A dream within a dream within a
dream? Is that even possible?"
511,COBB,511,Yes. It is.
512,COBB,512,"Now, the subconscious motivates
through emotion, not reason, so we
have to translate the idea into an
emotional concept."
513,ARTHUR,513,"How do you translate a business
strategy into an emotion?"
514,COBB,514,"That's what we have to figure out.
Robert and his father have a tense
relationship. Worse, even, than the
gossip columns have suggested..."
515,EAMES,515,"Do you play on that? Suggest
breaking up his father's company as
a 'screw you' to the old man?"
516,COBB,516,"No. Positive emotion trumps
negative emotion every time. We
yearn for people to be reconciled,
for catharsis. We need positive
emotional logic."
517,EAMES,517,"Try this... ""MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT
I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT
FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."""
518,COBB,518,That might work.
519,ARTHUR,519,"Might? We'll have to do better than
that."
520,EAMES,520,"Thanks for the contribution,
Arthur."
521,ARTHUR,521,"Forgive me for wanting a little
specificity, Eames."
522,COBB,522,"Inception's not about specificity.
When we get inside his head, we're
going to have to work with what we
find."
523,EAMES,523,"We could split the idea into
emotional triggers, and use one on
each level."
524,COBB,524,How do you mean?
525,EAMES,525,"On the top level, we open up his
relationship with his father....
Say: ""I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY
FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS."" Next level
down we've accessed his ambition
and self-esteem. We feed him: ""I
WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF.""
Then, the bottom level, we bring
out the emotional big guns..."
526,COBB,526,"""MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE
HIM."""
527,EAMES,527,That could do it.
528,ARTHUR,528,"How do you produce these emotional
triggers?"
529,EAMES,529,"I forge each emotional concept in
the style and manner of Peter
Browning, a key figure in Fischer's
emotional life."
530,ARTHUR,530,Are those yours?
531,ARTHUR,531,Yusuf?
532,YUSUF,532,Yup. Sorry.
533,COBB,533,"Suppress them. We don't bring our
own projections into the dream-we
let Fischer's subconscious supply
the people."
534,EAMES,534,"Saito, when do I get to see
Browning?"
535,SAITO,535,"You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday.
We've arranged for you to spend
several days..."
536,SAITO (V.O.),536,"...as part of a consulting
litigation team working for
Browning."
537,BROWNING,537,"I'm not smelling settlement here-we
take them down."
538,LAWYER,538,"Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's
policy is always one of avoiding
litigation-"
539,BROWNING,539,"Shall we relay your concerns
directly to Maurice?"
540,BROWNING,540,How is he?
541,BROWNING,541,"I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily but I know he-"
542,FATHER,542,"Robert! I've told you to keep out
the damn!-"
543,BROWNING,543,Must be a cherished memory of his-
544,FISCHER,544,"I put it by his bed. He hasn't even
noticed."
545,BROWNING,545,"Robert, we have to talk about a
power of attorney. I know this is
hard for you, but it's important
that we start to think about the
future-"
546,FISCHER,546,"Not now, Uncle Peter."
547,EAMES (V.O.),547,"The vultures are circling. The
sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the
stronger Peter Browning becomes..."
548,EAMES (V.O.),548,"I've had time to learn Browning's
physical presence and mannerisms..."
549,EAMES,549,"Now, in the dream, I can impersonate
Browning and suggest the concepts to
Fischer's conscious mind..."
550,EAMES,550,"Then we take Fischer down another
level and his own subconscious
feeds it right back to him."
551,ARTHUR,551,So he gives himself the idea.
552,EAMES,552,"Precisely. That's the only way
to make it stick. It has to seem
self-generated."
553,ARTHUR,553,"Eames, I'm impressed."
554,EAMES,554,"Your condescension, as always, is
much appreciated, Arthur."
555,EAMES,555,"He's not scheduled for surgery, no
dental, nothing."
556,COBB,556,I thought he had some knee thing?
557,EAMES,557,"Nothing they'd put him under for.
Besides, we need a good ten hours."
558,SAITO,558,Sydney to Los Angeles.
559,SAITO,559,"Twelve hours and forty-five
minutes-one of the longest flights
in the world. He makes it every two
weeks..."
560,COBB (V.O.),560,Surely he flies private?
561,SAITO (V.O.),561,"Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane."
562,ARTHUR,562,It'd have to be a 747.
563,COBB,563,Why?
564,ARTHUR,564,"On a 747 the pilots are up above,
first class is in the nose so
nobody walks through the cabin.
We'd have to buyout the whole
cabin, and the first class flight
attendant-"
565,SAITO,565,We bought the airline.
566,SAITO,566,It seemed... neater.
567,COBB,567,"Neater, huh?"
568,COBB,568,"Well, now we have ten uninterrupted
hours."
569,COBB (CONT'D),569,"Nice lobby, by the way."
570,ARTHUR,570,"My question is how we go down three
layers with enough stability. Three
layers down a little turbulence is
gonna translate into an earthquake.
The dreams are gonna collapse with
the slightest disturbance."
571,YUSUF,571,"Sedation. For sleep stable enough to
create three layers of dreaming..."
572,YUSUF (V.O.),572,"We will have to combine it with an
extremely powerful sedative...."
573,YUSUF,573,"The compound we'll be using to
share the dream is an advanced
Somnacin derivative. It creates a
very clear connection between
dreamers, whilst actually
accelerating brain function."
574,COBB,574,Buying us more time in each level.
575,YUSUF,575,"Brain function in the dream will be
about twenty times normal."
576,YUSUF (CONT'D),576,"And when you go into a dream within
that dream the effect is
compounded."
577,ARIADNE,577,How much time?
578,YUSUF,578,"Three dreams... that's ten hours,
times twenty, times twenty, times
twenty..."
579,EAMES,579,Math was never my strong suit.
580,COBB,580,"It's basically a week one layer
down, six months two layers down-"
581,ARIADNE,581,"And ten years in the third level.
Who wants to spend ten years in a
dream?"
582,YUSUF,582,Depends on the dream.
583,EAMES,583,"It's not going to take us long to
crack Fischer open once we get
going. We'll be out in a couple
days, max."
584,ARTHUR,584,"How do we get out once we've made
the plant?"
585,ARTHUR,585,"I hope you've got something a
little more elegant in mind than
shooting me in the head like last
time."
586,COBB,586,A kick.
587,ARIADNE,587,What's a kick?
588,EAMES,588,"That, Ariadne, would be a kick."
589,COBB,589,"That feeling of falling which snaps
you awake. We use that to jolt
ourselves awake once we're done."
590,ARTHUR,590,"But how are we going to feel that
through the sedation?"
591,YUSUF,591,"That's the clever part. I customize
the sedative..."
592,YUSUF (O.S.),592,"To leave inner ear function
unimpaired..."
593,YUSUF,593,"That way, however deep the sleep, the
sleeper will still feel falling..."
594,YUSUF (V.O.),594,Or tipping...
595,ARTHUR,595,"Even that won't cut through three
layers of deep sleep."
596,COBB,596,"The trick is to devise a kick for
each level, then synchronize them
to get a snap that penetrates all
three layers."
597,ARTHUR,597,"We can use the musical countdown to
synchronize the different kicks."
598,MAL,598,"You remember when you asked me to
marry you?"
599,COBB,599,Of course...
600,MAL,600,You said you had a dream...
601,COBB,601,That we'd grow old together.
602,MAL,602,"And we can. You know how to find
me... you know what you have to do."
603,COBB,603,You shouldn't be in here.
604,ARIADNE,604,"I wanted to know what ""tests"" you
need to do on your own every night."
605,ARIADNE,605,Why do you do this to yourself?
606,COBB,606,"This is the only way I can still
dream."
607,ARIADNE,607,Is it so important to dream?
608,COBB,608,In my dreams... we're still together.
609,ARIADNE,609,"But these aren't just dreams, are
they? They're memories. You said
never to use memories."
610,COBB,610,And I shouldn't.
611,ARIADNE,611,You're keeping her alive.
612,COBB,612,No.
613,ARIADNE,613,You can't let her go.
614,COBB,614,"No. These are moments I regret.
Moments I turned into dreams so I
could change them."
615,ARIADNE,615,"What've you got buried down there
that you regret?"
616,COBB,616,"There's only one thing I need you
to understand about me..."
617,ARIADNE,617,This is your house?
618,COBB,618,Mine and Mal's.
619,ARIADNE,619,Where is she?
620,COBB,620,She'd already died.
621,COBB,621,"It's James. My boy. He's found
something. Maybe a worm."
622,COBB,622,And there's Philippa.
623,COBB,623,"I thought about calling out, so
they'd turn and smile those
incredible smiles... but I'm out of
time-"
624,THIN MAN,624,"Right now. Or never, Cobb."
625,COBB,625,"Then I panic that I'll always wish
I'd seen them turn, that I can't
waste this chance..."
626,COBB,626,"But the moment's passed. And
whatever I do, the dream's always
the same... When I'm about to
call... they run."
627,COBB,627,"If I'm going to see their faces
again-I've got to get back here in
the real world..."
628,MAL (O.S.),628,What are you doing here?
629,ARIADNE,629,My name is-
630,MAL,630,"I know who you are. What are you
doing here?"
631,ARIADNE,631,I don't know. Trying to understand.
632,MAL,632,"How could you understand? Do you
know what it is to be a lover? To
be half of a whole?"
633,ARIADNE,633,No.
634,MAL,634,"I'll tell you a riddle. You're
waiting for a train. A train that
will take you far away. You know
where you hope this train will take
you, but you don't know for sure..."
635,MAL,635,"But... it doesn't matter. How can
it not matter to you where that
train will take you?"
636,COBB (O.S.),636,Because you'll be together.
637,MAL,637,"How could you bring her here, Dom?"
638,ARIADNE,638,What is this place?
639,COBB,639,"A hotel. We spent our anniversaries
in this suite."
640,ARIADNE,640,What happened here?
641,MAL,641,"you PROMISED! YOU SAID WE'D BE
TOGETHER!-"
642,COBB,642,"We can. We will. But I need you to
stay here for now-"
643,MAL,643,YOU SAID WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER!-
644,COBB,644,"I'll come back. I need you to stay
here on your own for now. Just
while I do this job. Then we can be
together-"
645,MAL,645,WE'LL BE TOGETHER-YOU PROMISED!-
646,ARIADNE,646,"You think you can just build a
prison of memories to lock her in?
You think that's going to contain
her?"
647,SAITO,647,Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
648,COBB,648,When's the funeral?
649,SAITO,649,Thursday. In Los Angeles.
650,COBB,650,"Robert'll accompany the body
Tuesday at the outside. We have to
move."
651,ARIADNE,651,I'm coming with you.
652,COBB,652,No. I promised Miles.
653,ARIADNE,653,"The team needs someone in there who
understands what you're struggling
with. If you don't want it to be me
then you need to show Arthur what I
just saw."
654,COBB,654,We need one more seat on the plane.
655,COBB,655,"If I get on this plane and you
haven't taken care of things...
when we land I go to jail for the
rest of my life."
656,SAITO,656,"Complete the job en route, I make
one phone call from the plane...
you will have no trouble clearing
immigration."
657,EAMES,657,"Oh, sorry."
658,COBB,658,Excuse me?
659,FISCHER,659,Yes?
660,COBB,660,I think this is yours...
661,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,661,"Would you gentlemen care for a
drink?"
662,FISCHER,662,Water.
663,COBB,663,Same.
664,FISCHER,664,"Well, thank you."
665,COBB,665,"No problem. Look, I couldn't help
noticing your name. You're not
related to Maurice Fischer?"
666,FISCHER,666,"Actually, he was my father."
667,COBB,667,"I'm very sorry for your loss. He
was an inspiring figure."
668,COBB,668,Thanks.
669,COBB,669,To Maurice Fischer.
670,COBB,670,I'll leave you in peace.
671,ARTHUR,671,"Couldn't you have peed before you
went under?"
672,YUSUF,672,Sorry.
673,EAMES,673,"Bit too much free champagne before
takeoff, Yusuf?"
674,YUSUF,674,Ha bloody ha.
675,COBB,675,"At least we know he'll be looking
for a cab in this."
676,COBB,676,Brace yourselves.
677,CABDRIVER,677,"Hey, asshole! Why don't you try
driving without your thumb up-"
678,COBB,678,Walk away.
679,FISCHER,679,Third and Market. Snappy.
680,FISCHER,680,What're you doing?
681,EAMES,681,"Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe
we could share."
682,FISCHER,682,Maybe not.
683,FISCHER,683,Great.
684,FISCHER,684,"There's 500 dollars in there. And
the wallet's worth more than that.
For that you ought to at least drop
me at my stop."
685,EAMES,685,I'm afraid-
686,EAMES,686,Get us out of here!
687,COBB,687,Come on!-
688,ARIADNE,688,This wasn't in the design-
689,ARTHUR,689,Everybody okay? Saito?
690,COBB,690,Arthur! Arthur what the-
691,COBB,691,"Oh, Christ. Is he dying?"
692,COBB,692,No.
693,EAMES,693,He's in agony. Let's wake him up-
694,COBB,694,No!
695,COBB,695,It won't wake him up.
696,EAMES,696,"What do you mean, it won't wake
him? When you die in a dream you
wake up."
697,YUSUF,697,"Not from this. We're too heavily
sedated to wake up that way."
698,EAMES,698,So what happens if one of us dies?
699,COBB,699,"That person doesn't wake up. Their
mind drops into Limbo."
700,ARIADNE,700,Limbo?
701,ARTHUR,701,Unconstructed dream space.
702,ARIADNE,702,What's down there?
703,ARTHUR,703,"Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing
there but what was left behind by
anyone on the team who's been trapped
there before. On this team... just
Cobb."
704,ARIADNE,704,How long would we be stuck there?
705,YUSUF,705,"You couldn't even think about
trying to escape until the sedation
eases-"
706,EAMES,706,How long?
707,YUSUF,707,"Decades-it could be infinite-I
don't know! Ask him-he's the one
who's been there before!"
708,EAMES,708,"Great. So now we're stuck in
Fischer's mind battling it out with
his private army, and if we get hit
we're stuck in Limbo 'til our
brains dissolve into scrambled egg?"
709,ARTHUR,709,Let's just get him upstairs.
710,ARTHUR,710,Hold this. Firm pressure.
711,ARTHUR,711,"You knew the risks and you didn't
tell us."
712,COBB,712,"There wasn't meant to be any risk.
We weren't supposed to be dealing
with a load of gunnre."
713,ARTHUR,713,You had no right.
714,COBB,714,"It's the only way you can go three
layers deep, Arthur."
715,ARTHUR,715,And you. You went along with this?
716,YUSUF,716,I trusted him.
717,ARTHUR,717,"You trusted him? When? When he
promised you half his share?"
718,YUSUF,718,"No! His whole share. Plus, he told
me he'd done it before."
719,ARTHUR,719,"Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out
great, didn't it, Cobb?"
720,COBB,720,"You don't know anything about that.
This was the only way to do this
job, Arthur. I did what I had to do
to get back to my children."
721,EAMES,721,"So you led us into a war zone with
no way out."
722,COBB,722,"We have a way out. The kick. We
just have to push on, do the job as
fast as possible and get out using
the kick."
723,EAMES,723,"Forget it. We go any deeper, we
just raise the stakes. I'm sitting
it out on this level."
724,COBB,724,"You'll never make it, Eames.
Fischer's security is surrounding
this place as we speak. The ten
hours of the flight is a week at
this level-you'll never make it
without getting killed. Downwards
is the only way forwards. We have
to carry on."
725,COBB,725,And we have to do it fast.
726,COBB,726,"Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's
get in there and soften him up."
727,FISCHER,727,"I'm insured against kidnapping up
to ten million-this'll be simple-"
728,COBB,728,"No, it won't."
729,ARTHUR,729,"In. your lather's office, below the
bookshelves, is his personal safe.
We need the combination."
730,FISCHER,730,I never noticed a safe-
731,COBB,731,"Doesn't mean you don't know the
combination."
732,FISCHER,732,"Well, I don't."
733,ARTHUR,733,"We have it on good authority that
you do."
734,FISCHER,734,Whose?
735,YUSUF,735,"Five hundred dollars, this cost?"
736,EAMES,736,What's inside?
737,YUSUF,737,"Cash, cards, ID... and this-"
738,EAMES,738,Useful?
739,COBB,739,You're on. You've got an hour.
740,EAMES,740,"An hour? I was supposed to have all
night to crack him."
741,COBB,741,"And Saito was supposed to keep his
guts on the inside. You've got an
hour-get something we can use."
742,FISCHER,742,What's that?
743,ARTHUR,743,Good authority.
744,FISCHER,744,Uncle Peter?! Make them stop-
745,ARTHUR,745,The combination.
746,FISCHER,746,I don't know it!
747,ARTHUR,747,Why would Browning tell us you did?
748,FISCHER,748,Let me talk to him-I'll find out.
749,COBB,749,You've got an hour. Get talking.
750,BROWNING (EAMES),750,"They've had me for two days.
They've got someone with access to
your father's office and they're
trying to open his safe-they
thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't-"
751,FISCHER,751,"Neither do I, Uncle Peter."
752,BROWNING,752,"Maurice told me that after he
passed only you would be able to
open it."
753,FISCHER,753,He never gave me the combination.
754,BROWNING,754,"He did, he just didn't tell you
that it was a combination."
755,FISCHER,755,"What, then?"
756,BROWNING,756,"Something only you would know. Some
meaningful combination of numbers
from your experiences with Maurice-"
757,FISCHER,757,"We didn't have a lot of meaningful
experiences together."
758,BROWNING,758,Perhaps after your mother died...
759,FISCHER,759,"After my mother died, I went to him
in my grief."
760,FISCHER (CONT'D),760,"You know what he told me? ""There's
really nothing to be said, Robert."""
761,BROWNING,761,"He always had a hard time with
emotional-"
762,FISCHER,762,"I was eleven, Uncle Peter."
763,BROWNING,763,"He loved you, Robert. In his way."
764,FISCHER,764,"""In his way?"" At the end he called
me to his deathbed. He could barely
speak, but he took the trouble to
say one last thing to me. He pulled
me close... I could make out only
one word. ""Disappointed."""
765,COBB,765,How's he doing?
766,ARIADNE,766,He's in a lot of pain.
767,COBB,767,"When we get you down to the next
level, the pain will be less
intense."
768,ARIADNE,768,And if he dies?
769,COBB,769,"His conscious mind will drop out of
the dream. He'll be trapped in
Limbo for a lifetime..."
770,ARIADNE,770,What will that do to him?
771,COBB,771,"When he wakes... his mind could be
completely gone."
772,SAITO,772,"When... when we wake I will still
honor our arrangement..."
773,COBB,773,"Saito-san, when you wake you might
not even remember that we had an
arrangement. You'll have forgotten
this world. Limbo will be your
reality. Lost there so long, you'll
have become an old man..."
774,SAITO,774,Filled with regret?
775,COBB,775,Waiting to die alone. Yes.
776,SAITO,776,"Then I'll take the chance and come
back. And we'll be young men
together again."
777,ARIADNE,777,When were you trapped in Limbo?
778,ARIADNE,778,"Cobb, you might have convinced the
rest of this team to carry on with
the job. But they don't know the
truth."
779,COBB,779,What truth?
780,ARIADNE,780,"The truth that at any minute you
might bring a freight train through
the wall. The truth that Mal is
bursting up through your
subconscious."
781,ARIADNE (CONT'D),781,"The truth that as we go deeper into
Fischer, we're also going deeper
into you-and I'm not sure we're
going to like what we find there."
782,ARIADNE,782,"This is not just about Fischer,
it's about you. Tell me what
happened to you and Mal. Trapped in
Limbo."
783,COBB,783,"We were on a job. Exploring dreams
within dreams. But we didn't
understand how your mind can turn
hours into years. How you can get
trapped. Trapped so deep that when
you wash up on the shore of your
subconscious..."
784,COBB,784,You can lose track of what's real.
785,ARIADNE,785,How long were you stuck?
786,COBB,786,Fifty years.
787,ARIADNE,787,How did you stand it?
788,COBB,788,"We built. We created a whole world
for ourselves..."
789,COBB,789,"It's not so bad at first, being
gods. The problem is knowing that
it's not real. It became impossible
for me to live like that."
790,ARIADNE,790,But not for her?
791,COBB,791,She accepted it. At some point...
792,COBB (V.O.),792,"...she'd decided to forget that our
world wasn't real."
793,ARIADNE,793,And when you finally woke up?
794,COBB,794,"To wake from that. From decades
lived. To be old souls thrown back
into youth. It was hard. At first
Mal seemed okay. But I started to
realize something was wrong.
Finally she admitted it. This idea
she was possessed by. This simple
little idea that changed
everything..."
795,ARIADNE,795,What was it?
796,COBB,796,"That our world was not real. No
matter what I did, no matter what I
said, she was convinced that we
were still in a dream. That we
needed to wake up again..."
797,COBB (V.O.),797,"That to get home we'd have to kill
ourselves."
798,ARIADNE,798,What about your children?
799,COBB,799,"She... she believed they weren't
real. That our real children were
waiting. Somewhere above..."
800,COBB,800,"Calm down, Mal-"
801,MAL,801,"They're projections, Dom. Your
dreams. I'm their mother-don't you
think I can tell the difference?"
802,COBB,802,"If it's my dream then why can't I
control it? Why can't I stop this?"
803,MAL,803,You don't know you're dreaming.
804,COBB,804,You keep telling me I am-
805,MAL,805,And you don't believe me!
806,COBB (V.O.),806,"She was certain. But she loved me
too much to go without me. So she
made a plan..."
807,COBB (V.O.),807,For our anniversary...
808,MAL,808,Join me.
809,COBB,809,"Mal, come back inside."
810,MAL,810,"No. I'm going to jump. And you're
coming with me."
811,COBB,811,"No, I'm not. This is real-if you
jump, you're not going to wake up,
you're going to die. Let's go back
inside and talk about this, please."
812,MAL,812,We've talked enough.
813,MAL,813,"Come out onto the ledge or I'll
jump right now."
814,MAL,814,"I'm asking you to take a leap of
faith."
815,COBB,815,"I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave
our children."
816,MAL,816,"If I go without you, they'll take
them away, anyway."
817,COBB,817,What do you mean?
818,MAL,818,"I filed a letter with our attorney.
Explaining how I'm fearful for my
safety, how you've threatened to
kill me..."
819,MAL (CONT'D),819,"I love you, Dom. I've freed you
from the guilt of choosing to leave
them. We're going home to our real
children."
820,COBB,820,"Out children are here, Mal."
821,MAL,821,You're waiting for a train...
822,COBB,822,"NO! MAL, NO, I CAN'T!"
823,MAL,823,"A train that will take you far
away..."
824,COBB,824,DON'T DO THIS!
825,MAL,825,"You know where you hope this train
will take you, you can't know for
sure..."
826,COBB,826,DON'T!
827,MAL,827,But it doesn't matter...
828,COBB,828,NO!
829,MAL,829,Because you'll be together...
830,COBB,830,"He letter to the authorities
refuted all the claims about her
sanity that she knew I'd make..."
831,COBB (V.O.),831,"She'd had herself declared sane by
three different psychiatrists."
832,COBB (V.O.) (CONT'D),832,"It was impossible for me to explain
the nature of her madness..."
833,THIN MAN,833,"Right now. Or never, Cobb."
834,COBB (V.O.),834,"So I ran. And I've been running
ever since, trying to buy my way
back to my family..."
835,ARIADNE,835,Psychiatrists judged her sane?
836,COBB,836,"She was sane. She was just lost in
the labyrinth."
837,ARIADNE,837,Then why should you blame yourself?
838,COBB,838,"Because we were a family. And we
had a life I would do anything to
get back to now. But that reality
wasn't enough for me then."
839,ARIADNE,839,"It might have been your idea to
push the limits, Cobb. But you're
not responsible for the idea that
destroyed her. The idea that her
world wasn't real... that was her
own idea from her own mind."
840,ARIADNE (CONT'D),840,"Your guilt defines her. Powers her.
If we're going to succeed in this,
you're going to have to forgive
yourself, and you're going to have
to confront her. But you don't have
to do it alone."
841,COBB,841,You don't have to do this for me-
842,ARIADNE,842,"I'm doing it for the others. They
don't know the risk they've taken
coming in here with you."
843,COBB,843,We can't stay here. Arthur?!
844,BROWNING,844,"These people are going to kill us
if we don't give them the
combination."
845,FISCHER,845,"They won't, they'll try to ransom
us-"
846,BROWNING,846,"I heard them-they're going to lock
us in and run the can into the
river."
847,FISCHER,847,What is in the safe?
848,BROWNING,848,"Something for you. Maurice always
said it was his most previous
gift... a will."
849,FISCHER,849,"Maurice's will is with Port and
Dunn."
850,BROWNING,850,"It's an alternate. It supersedes
the other only if you want it to."
851,FISCHER,851,What does it say?
852,BROWNING,852,"It splits all the component
businesses of Fischer Morrow into
individual companies, transferring
ownership to the boards of those
companies..."
853,FISCHER,853,Leaving me nothing?
854,BROWNING,854,"A basic living. Nothing more. The
entire empire would cease to exist."
855,FISCHER,855,"Destroy my own inheritance? Why
would he suggest such a thing?"
856,BROWNING,856,"I don't know, Robert."
857,COBB,857,Come to your senses?
858,FISCHER,858,"Let us go. I don't know the
combination. Not consciously."
859,COBB,859,"Let's try instinctively. I have
someone standing in your father's
office ready to tap in a
combination."
860,COBB (CONT'D),860,"First six numbers that come into
your head. Right now."
861,FISCHER,861,I have no idea-
862,COBB,862,RIGHT NOW!
863,FISCHER,863,"Five, two, eight... four, nine,
one."
864,COBB,864,You'll have to do better. Bag `em.
865,FISCHER,865,"We're worth much more to you
alive..."
866,EAMES,866,"His relationship with his father's
much worse that we thought."
867,ARTHUR,867,That helps us?
868,COBB,868,"The stronger the issues, the more
powerful the catharsis."
869,ARTHUR,869,"But how do you reconcile them if
they're that estranged?"
870,EAMES,870,I'm working on that.
871,ARTHUR,871,"Well, work fast-Fischer's
projections are closing in quick,
we need to break out of here before
we're totally boxed in..."
872,EAMES,872,"Shouldn't be afraid to dream a
little bigger, Arthur-"
873,EAMES (CONT'D),873,Shall we?
874,COBB,874,"Shifting Fischer's antipathy from
his father onto Browning should
work."
875,EAMES,875,"We need the imagery, the words..."
876,ARIADNE,876,"So you destroy his one positive
relationship?"
877,COBB,877,"No. We repair his relationship with
his father and expose his
godfather's true nature."
878,EAMES,878,"Hell, we should be charging Fischer
as much as Saito."
879,ARTHUR,879,"What about his security? It's going
to get worse as we go deeper."
880,COBB,880,We bring in Mr. Charles.
881,ARTHUR,881,No.
882,EAMES,882,Who's Mr. Charles?
883,ARTHUR,883,A bad idea.
884,COBB,884,"Arthur, the second we approach
Fischer in that hotel, they're
gonna mow us down-we run with Mr.
Charles like on the Stein job."
885,EAMES,885,So you've done it before?
886,ARTHUR,886,"Sure. But it didn't work. The
subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to
pieces."
887,EAMES,887,"You learned a lot, though. Right?"
888,COBB,888,I'll need a decoy.
889,EAMES,889,"No problem. How about a pretty
young lady I've used before?"
890,COBB,890,Fine-
891,COBB (CONT'D),891,"I know you've got to stay ahead of
them, but drive with kid gloves,
okay? The world down there is going
to be very unstable-"
892,ARTHUR,892,"And don't make the jump too soon-
that kick is our only way back, we
have to be ready to catch it-"
893,YUSUF,893,"I'll use the music to let you know
when it's coming, but the rest is
up to you."
894,YUSUF (CONT'D),894,Everyone ready?
895,YUSUF (CONT'D),895,Sweet dreams-
896,BLONDE (O.S.),896,Am I boring you?
897,BLONDE (CONT'D),897,"I was telling you my story. I guess
it wasn't to your liking."
898,FISCHER,898,I have a lot on my mind.
899,ARTHUR,899,And there goes Mr. Charles.
900,ARIADNE,900,"Who or what, exactly, is Mr.
Charles?"
901,ARTHUR,901,"It's a gambit designed to turn
Fischer against his own
subconscious."
902,COBB,902,"Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again.
Rod Green, Marketing."
903,COBB,903,And you must be...
904,BLONDE,904,Leaving.
905,BLONDE (CONT'D),905,In case you get bored.
906,COBB,906,"I think you just got blown off...
unless her phone number really does
have only six digits."
907,ARIADNE,907,And why don't you approve?
908,ARTHUR,908,"Because it involves telling the
mark that he's dreaming. Which
involves attracting a lot of
attention to us."
909,ARIADNE,909,Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
910,ARTHUR,910,"You must've noticed by now how much
time Cobb spends doing things he
says never to do."
911,COBB,911,Strange way to make friends.
912,COBB,912,"Lifting your wallet, I mean."
913,FISCHER,913,"Goddamn it. The wallet alone's
worth-"
914,COBB,914,"Five hundred bucks. I know. Don't
worry, my guys are on it."
915,FISCHER,915,Who did you say you were?
916,COBB,916,"I said I was Rod Green from
Marketing-but I'm not. My name is
Mr. Charles. I might seem familiar
to you. I'm in charge of your
security here."
917,BLONDE,917,"Mr. Saito, can I have a minute?"
918,SAITO,918,"I'm sorry, but..."
919,SAITO (CONT'D),919,"Very amusing, Mr. Eames."
920,EAMES,920,You look a bit perkier.
921,SAITO,921,Turbulence on the plane.
922,EAMES,922,"Feels closer. That's Yusuf's
driving."
923,FISCHER,923,Security? You work for the hotel?
924,COBB,924,"No. My specialty is subconscious
security."
925,FISCHER,925,"You're talking about dreams. You're
talking about extraction."
926,COBB,926,"Exactly. My job is to protect
you..."
927,COBB (CONT'D),927,"My job is to protect you from any
attempt to access your mind through
your dreams."
928,EAMES,928,"Get off at a different floor and
keep moving. Dump the wallet, then
meet me in the lobby. The security
will try to track it down. We need
to buy Cobb a little more time."
929,COBB,929,You're not safe here.
930,COBB (CONT'D),930,Trust me. They're coming for you.
931,COBB,931,"Strange weather, huh?"
932,COBB (CONT'D),932,You feel that?
933,ARIADNE,933,What's happening?
934,ARTHUR,934,"Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream.
That's making his subconscious look
for the dreamer. For me."
935,COBB,935,"Very odd-the weather, the
gravity..."
936,COBB (CONT'D),936,"But I can explain all this. You've
actually been trained for this."
937,COBB (CONT'D),937,"Think of the strangeness of the
weather, the shifts in gravity.
None of this is real..."
938,COBB (CONT'D),938,We're in a dream.
939,COBB (CONT'D),939,"The simplest test of what I'm
saying is for you to try and
remember anything about the way you
arrived in this hotel... okay?"
940,COBB (CONT'D),940,"Breathe. Remember the training.
Accept the fact that we're in a
dream. That's why I'm here
protecting you."
941,FISCHER,941,So you... you're not real?
942,COBB,942,"No. I'm a projection of your
subconscious. I was put in place to
protect you in the event that
extractors pulled you into a dream.
I believe that's what has happened."
943,FISCHER,943,Hey-
944,FISCHER (CONT'D),944,Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!
945,COBB,945,Look at the gun in his hand.
946,COBB (CONT'D),946,These men were sent to abduct you.
947,COBB (CONT'D),947,"If I'm going to help you, I need
you to be calm."
948,FISCHER,948,"If this is a dream, I have to kill
myself and wake up-"
949,COBB,949,"I wouldn't do that-they've probably
got you sedated. If you pull that
trigger, you might not wake up, you
might drop into a lower dream
state."
950,COBB (CONT'D),950,"Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you
just have to remember it..."
951,ARTHUR,951,"So, if everything's correct, this
room should be directly below 528."
952,COBB,952,"What do you remember from before
this dream?"
953,FISCHER,953,Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter.
954,FISCHER,954,Christ-we've been kidnapped.
955,COBB,955,Where were they holding you?
956,FISCHER,956,"They had us... in the back of a
van..."
957,COBB,957,"Your body's bouncing around in the
back of a van right now-that
explains the gravity shifts."
958,FISCHER,958,"It was... to do with a safe...
Christ, why's it so hard to
remember?"
959,COBB,959,"It's like trying to remember a
dream after you've woken up. It
takes years of practice to do it
easily. So, you and Browning have
been pulled into this dream so they
can steal something from your mind.
What?"
960,FISCHER,960,"They wanted a combination to a
safe... they demanded the first
numbers to pop into my head."
961,COBB,961,That's them extracting a locator.
962,FISCHER,962,A locator?
963,COBB,963,"A number from your own
subconscious. It can be used any
number of ways..."
964,COBB,964,"This is a hotel. Room numbers. What
was the number you gave them?"
965,FISCHER,965,"5, 2... something... it was a long
number. 528... 528, 4 something."
966,COBB,966,"Well, we know where to start."
967,COBB,967,Fifth floor.
968,ARIADNE,968,Do you use a timer?
969,ARTHUR,969,"No, I have to judge it myself. Once
you're all asleep up in room 528, I
wait `til Yusuf starts his kick..."
970,ARIADNE,970,How will you know?
971,ARTHUR,971,"His music warns me it's coming,
then the van hitting the barrier of
the bridge should be unmistakable-
that's when I blow the floor out
from underneath us and we get a
nice synchronized kick. Too soon,
and we won't get pulled out; too
late and I won't be able to drop
us."
972,ARIADNE,972,Why not?
973,ARTHUR,973,"The van will be in free fall. I
can't drop us with no gravity."
974,SAITO,974,I see you've changed.
975,BROWNING,975,I'm sorry?
976,SAITO,976,I'm... I mistook you for a friend.
977,BROWNING,977,"Good-looking fellow, I'm sure."
978,EAMES,978,"That's Fischer's projection of
Browning. We'll keep an eye on how
he behaves-"
979,SAITO,979,Why?
980,EAMES,980,"How he acts will tell us if
Fischer's starting to suspect his
motives the way we want him to."
981,COBB,981,They work for me.
982,ARTHUR,982,Mr. Charles!
983,COBB,983,You know what this is?
984,FISCHER,984,I think so. But I don't understand.
985,COBB,985,They were going to put you under.
986,FISCHER,986,I'm already under.
987,COBB,987,Under again.
988,FISCHER,988,A dream within a dream?
989,ARTHUR,989,Shhhh!
990,FISCHER,990,Uncle Peter. What's going on?
991,COBB,991,"You said you were kidnapped
together?"
992,FISCHER,992,"Not exactly, they already had him.
They'd been torturing him..."
993,COBB,993,You saw them torture him?
994,FISCHER,994,The kidnappers are working for you.
995,BROWNING,995,"No, Robert-"
996,FISCHER,996,"You're trying to get that safe
open. To get the alternate will."
997,BROWNING,997,"Fischer Morrow's been my entire
life. I can't let you destroy it."
998,FISCHER,998,"I'm not going to throw away my
inheritance. Why would I?"
999,BROWNING,999,"I couldn't take the chance of you
rising to your father's final
taunt."
1000,FISCHER,1000,What taunt?
1001,BROWNING,1001,"That will. I'm sorry, Robert, but
it's his final insult. A challenge
to build something for yourself.
He's telling you that you aren't
worthy of his achievements."
1002,FISCHER,1002,"That he was ""disappointed?"""
1003,BROWNING,1003,"I'm so sorry. But he was wrong.
You'll make his company even
greater than he ever could."
1004,COBB,1004,"Your godfather's lying, Robert."
1005,FISCHER,1005,How do you know?
1006,COBB,1006,"It's what I do. He's hiding
something."
1007,COBB,1007,Let's find out what.
1008,COBB,1008,"Let's do to him what he was going
to do to you."
1009,COBB,1009,"We'll penetrate his subconscious
and find out what he doesn't want
you to know."
1010,ARTHUR,1010,He's out.
1011,ARIADNE,1011,"Wait, Cobb-I'm lost. Whose
subconscious are we going into?"
1012,COBB,1012,"Fischer's. I told him it was
Browning's so he'd come with us as
part of our team."
1013,ARTHUR,1013,"He's going to help us break into
his own subconscious."
1014,COBB,1014,"That's the idea. He'll think that
his security is Browning's and
fight them to learn the truth about
his father."
1015,COBB,1015,"Fischer's subconscious is going to
run you down hard."
1016,ARTHUR,1016,I'll lead them on a merry chase.
1017,COBB,1017,Be back in time for the kick.
1018,ARTHUR,1018,I'm on it.
1019,ARIADNE (O.S.),1019,Cobb? Cobb?
1020,ARIADNE,1020,What's down there?
1021,COBB,1021,"Hopefully, the truth we want
Fischer to learn."
1022,ARIADNE,1022,I meant what's down there for you?
1023,COBB,1023,"You're the dreamer. I need you to
draw the security away from the
complex."
1024,EAMES,1024,Then who guides Fischer in? You?
1025,COBB,1025,"If I know the route... we could be
compromised."
1026,ARIADNE,1026,I designed the place.
1027,COBB,1027,No. You're with me.
1028,SAITO (O.S.),1028,I could do it.
1029,COBB,1029,"Eames, brief Saito on the route
into the complex. What we're
looking for is going to be in the
most heavily fortified section.
That north tower."
1030,COBB,1030,"Mr. Fischer, you're going in with
Mr. Saito."
1031,FISCHER,1031,You're not coming in?
1032,COBB,1032,"You have to do this on your own.
You have to get in there, break
into your godfather's mind and find
out the truth about your father."
1033,COBB,1033,"Keep this live at all times. I'll
be listening in, covering you."
1034,COBB,1034,"The windows on the upper floors are
big enough that I can cover you
from that south tower."
1035,YUSUF,1035,Bugger.
1036,ARTHUR,1036,Hey!
1037,YUSUF,1037,Sod it. I hope your ready.
1038,ARTHUR,1038,"No, Yusuf. Too soon!"
1039,EAMES (OVER RADIO),1039,Cobb? Are you hearing that?
1040,EAMES,1040,"I noticed it twenty minutes ago-at
first I thought it was just wind..."
1041,COBB,1041,"No, it's music. Dammit."
1042,EAMES (OVER RADIO),1042,What do we do?
1043,COBB,1043,"We move fast. Saito, did you copy?"
1044,SAITO,1044,We're going as fast as we can.
1045,ARIADNE,1045,How long do we have?
1046,COBB,1046,"Yusuf's about ten seconds from the
jump, which gives Arthur about
three minutes, which gives us about-"
1047,ARIADNE,1047,Sixty minutes.
1048,COBB,1048,"The route you gave them, can they
do it in under an hour?"
1049,ARIADNE,1049,"I don't think so. They've still got
to climb down to the middle
terrace."
1050,COBB,1050,"They need a new route-a direct
route."
1051,ARIADNE,1051,"The building's designed as a
labyrinth."
1052,COBB,1052,"There must be access routes that
cut through the maze."
1053,COBB,1053,Eames?
1054,COBB,1054,Did Eames add any features?
1055,ARIADNE,1055,Yes.
1056,COBB,1056,What did he add?
1057,ARIADNE,1057,I shouldn't tell you. If Mal-
1058,COBB,1058,There's no time-what did he add?
1059,ARIADNE,1059,"Utility closets, trap doors..."
1060,COBB,1060,"What about service features? Did he
add any large pipes or-"
1061,ARIADNE,1061,"Ducts. He added an air duct system-
it doesn't follow the maze. They
can use it to go straight from the
outer walls to the upper tower."
1062,COBB,1062,Explain it to them.
1063,ARIADNE,1063,Saito?
1064,SAITO,1064,Go ahead.
1065,ARTHUR,1065,Paradox.
1066,SAITO,1066,Look out!
1067,ARIADNE,1067,What was that?
1068,COBB,1068,The kick.
1069,EAMES (OVER RADIO),1069,Cobb? Did we miss it?
1070,COBB,1070,"Yeah, we missed it."
1071,EAMES,1071,What the hell do we do now?
1072,COBB (OVER RADIO),1072,"Finish the job before the next
kick."
1073,EAMES,1073,What next kick?
1074,COBB,1074,"When the van hits the water. I
figure Arthur's got a couple
minutes and we've got about twenty."
1075,ARTHUR,1075,How the hell do I drop you?
1076,ARIADNE,1076,"That's the antechamber outside the
strongroom."
1077,COBB,1077,"What about the strongroom? Doesn't
it have any windows?"
1078,ARIADNE,1078,Wouldn't be very strong if it did.
1079,ARIADNE,1079,"Look, if you wanted to design it
yourself-"
1080,COBB,1080,"It's fine. Better hope that we like
what Fischer finds in there."
1081,ARIADNE,1081,"These projections, they're part of
his subconscious?"
1082,COBB,1082,Yeah.
1083,ARIADNE,1083,"Are you destroying those parts of
his mind?"
1084,COBB,1084,"No, of course not. They're just
projections."
1085,EAMES (OVER RADIO),1085,Cobb? Something's wrong?
1086,EAMES,1086,"They're heading your way. Like they
know something."
1087,COBB,1087,Buy us some time.
1088,EAMES (OVER RADIO),1088,On my way.
1089,FISCHER,1089,"We're here. Are we clear to
proceed?"
1090,COBB,1090,"You're clear, but hurry-there's an
army headed your way..."
1091,COBB,1091,"Shit. There's someone else in
there."
1092,ARIADNE,1092,"Fischer, stop! It's a trap!-"
1093,COBB,1093,"Come on... a little lower... a
little-"
1094,ARIADNE,1094,"Cobb, that's not really her-"
1095,COBB,1095,How can you know that?
1096,FISCHER,1096,I'm in.
1097,ARIADNE (OVER RADIO),1097,"Fischer, look out!-"
1098,MAL,1098,Hello.
1099,ARIADNE,1099,"Cobb, she's just a projection.
Fischer... he's real."
1100,ARIADNE,1100,Eames? Get to the anteroom now!
1101,EAMES,1101,What happened?
1102,ARIADNE,1102,Mal killed Fischer-
1103,COBB,1103,I wouldn't shoot her.
1104,COBB,1104,It won't do any good-
1105,COBB,1105,"Even if you could revive his body,
his mind's trapped down there. It's
over."
1106,EAMES,1106,"So that it, then? We failed."
1107,COBB,1107,I'm sorry.
1108,EAMES,1108,"It's you who doesn't get back to
your family."
1109,EAMES,1109,"I wanted to know what was going to
happen in there. I think we had
this one."
1110,ARIADNE,1110,"There's still a way: We follow
Fischer down-"
1111,EAMES,1111,We're almost out of time-
1112,ARIADNE,1112,"Down there they'll be enough time.
We'll find him-soon as you hear
Arthur's music start, you use the
defibrillator to revive him-we give
him his own early kick from below."
1113,ARIADNE (CONT'D),1113,Get him in there-
1114,ARIADNE (CONT'D),1114,"Then, as the music ends you blow
the hospital and we all ride the
kick back up through the layers."
1115,EAMES,1115,"Okay, Saito can hold them off while
I plant the rest of the charges."
1116,COBB,1116,"Saito's not going to last, Eames."
1117,ARIADNE,1117,We have to try!
1118,EAMES,1118,"Go for it, but I'm taking the kick
whether you're back or not..."
1119,ARIADNE,1119,"Can I trust you to do what's
needed? Mal's down there-"
1120,COBB,1120,"And I can find her. She'll have
Fischer."
1121,ARIADNE,1121,How do you know?
1122,COBB,1122,"She wants me to come after him. She
wants me back down there with her."
1123,ARIADNE,1123,This is your world?
1124,COBB,1124,"It was. And this is where she'll
be."
1125,EAMES,1125,"Come on, Saito. I need you to cover
Fischer while I plant the charges."
1126,ARIADNE,1126,You built all this?
1127,COBB,1127,We both did.
1128,ARIADNE,1128,It's incredible.
1129,COBB,1129,"We built for years. Then, when that
got stale, we started in on the
memories."
1130,COBB,1130,This is our neighborhood.
1131,ARIADNE,1131,From what city?
1132,COBB,1132,No. Our neighborhood.
1133,COBB,1133,"That was our first apartment...
then we moved to that building...
we got that small house when Mal
became pregnant."
1134,ARIADNE,1134,"You reconstructed them all from
memory?"
1135,COBB,1135,We had time.
1136,ARIADNE,1136,What's that?
1137,COBB,1137,The house Mal grew up in.
1138,ARIADNE,1138,Will she be in there?
1139,COBB,1139,No. Come on-
1140,COBB,1140,"We both wanted a house, but we both
loved skyscrapers. In the real
world we had to choose. Not here."
1141,ARIADNE,1141,How do we send Fischer back?
1142,COBB,1142,We need some kind of kick.
1143,ARIADNE,1143,What?
1144,COBB,1144,I'll improvise.
1145,COBB,1145,"There's something you have to
understand about me. About
inception. You see, an idea is like
a virus..."
1146,COBB,1146,Resilient...
1147,COBB,1147,"Highly contagious, and an idea can
grow. The smallest seed of an idea
can grow to define or destroy your
world..."
1148,MAL,1148,"The smallest idea, such as... ""Your
world is not real."""
1149,MAL,1149,"A simple little thought that
changes everything..."
1150,MAL,1150,"So certain of your world. Of what's
real. Do you think he is-"
1151,MAL,1151,"Or do you think he's as lost as I
was?"
1152,COBB,1152,I know what's real.
1153,MAL,1153,"What are the distinguishing
characteristics of a dream? Mutable
laws of physics? Tell that to the
quantum physicists. Reappearance of
the dead? What about heaven and
hell? Persecution of the dreamer,
the creator, the messiah? They
crucified Christ, didn't they?"
1154,COBB,1154,I know what's real.
1155,MAL,1155,"No creeping doubts? Not feeling
persecuted, Dom? Chased around the
globe by anonymous corporations and
police forces? The way the
projections persecute the dreamer?"
1156,MAL,1156,"Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in
one reality anymore. So choose.
Choose your reality like I did.
Choose to be here. Choose me."
1157,COBB,1157,"I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I
have to get back to them. Because
you left them. You left us."
1158,MAL,1158,"You're wrong, Dom. You're confused...
our children are here-"
1159,MAL,1159,"And you'd like to see their faces
again, wouldn't you, Dom?"
1160,COBB,1160,"Our real children are waiting for
me up above."
1161,MAL,1161,"Up above? Listen to yourself. You
judged me for believing the very
same thing."
1162,MAL,1162,These are our children. Watch.
1163,MAL,1163,"Hey, James! Philippa?!"
1164,COBB,1164,"They're not real, Mal. Our real
children are waiting for us-"
1165,MAL,1165,"You keep telling yourself that but
you don't believe it-"
1166,COBB,1166,I know it-
1167,MAL,1167,"And what if you're wrong? What if
I'm what's real?"
1168,MAL,1168,"You keep telling yourself what you
know... but what do you believe?
What do you feel?"
1169,COBB,1169,"Guilt. I feel guilt. And however
confused I might get."
1170,COBB (CONT'D),1170,"However lost I might seem... it's
always there. Telling me something.
Reminding me of the truth."
1171,MAL,1171,What truth?
1172,COBB,1172,"That you were wrong to doubt our
world. That the idea that drove you
to question your reality was a
lie..."
1173,MAL,1173,How could you know it was a lie?
1174,COBB,1174,Because it was my lie.
1175,MAL,1175,"Because you planted the idea in my
mind."
1176,COBB,1176,"Because I performed inception on my
own wife, then reaped the bitter
rewards..."
1177,ARIADNE,1177,Why?
1178,COBB,1178,"We'd become lost in here. Living in
a world of infinite possibilities.
A world where we were gods. I
realized we needed to escape, but
she'd locked away her knowledge of
the unreality of this world..."
1179,COBB,1179,"I couldn't make Mal understand that
we needed to break free. To die. So
I started to search our world..."
1180,COBB,1180,"Searching for the right place in
her mind..."
1181,COBB,1181,"And when I found that place, that
secret place where she had shut
away her knowledge years before, I
broke it open..."
1182,COBB,1182,"I broke into the deepest recess of
her mind, to give her the simplest
little idea."
1183,COBB,1183,"A truth that she had once known,
but had chosen to forget..."
1184,COBB,1184,That her world was not real.
1185,COBB (V.O.),1185,That death was a necessary escape.
1186,COBB,1186,"You're waiting for a train. A train
that will take you far away. You
know where you hope this train will
take you, but you can't know for
sure. Yet it doesn't matter..."
1187,MAL,1187,Because you'll be together.
1188,COBB,1188,"I never thought that the idea I'd
planted would grow in her mind like
a cancer. That even after we woke..."
1189,COBB,1189,"You'd continue to believe that your
world was not real..."
1190,MAL,1190,That death was the only escape?
1191,MAL,1191,You killed me.
1192,COBB,1192,I was trying to save you-I'm sorry.
1193,MAL,1193,"You infected my mind. You betrayed
me. But you can make amends. You
can still keep your promise. We can
still be together... right here. In
our world. The world we built
together."
1194,ARIADNE,1194,We need Fischer.
1195,MAL,1195,You can't have him.
1196,COBB,1196,"If I stay, can she take him back?"
1197,ARIADNE,1197,"Cobb, what are you saying?"
1198,MAL,1198,Fischer's on the porch.
1199,ARIADNE,1199,"Cobb, you can't do this."
1200,COBB,1200,"Go check he's alive, Ariadne."
1201,ARIADNE,1201,"He's here. And it's time. But you
have to come with us."
1202,ARIADNE,1202,"Cobb, I'm not going to let you lose
yourself in here! You have to get
back to your children!"
1203,COBB,1203,"Send Fischer, I have to stay-"
1204,ARIADNE,1204,You can't stay here to be with her-
1205,COBB,1205,"I'm not. Saito is dead by now. That
means he's here. I have to stay
here and find him."
1206,COBB,1206,"I can't stay here to be with her
because she's not real."
1207,MAL,1207,"Not real? I'm the only thing you do
believe in anymore. Here-doesn't
this feel real, Dom?"
1208,COBB,1208,"I wish you were. But I couldn't
make you real. I'm not capable of
imagining you in all your
complexity and... perfection. As
you really were. You're the best I
can do. And you're not real."
1209,ARIADNE,1209,No!
1210,COBB,1210,What're you doing?
1211,ARIADNE,1211,Improvising.
1212,EAMES,1212,Get in there-quick!
1213,COBB,1213,No!
1214,FATHER,1214,I... was ... dis ... dis ...
1215,FISCHER,1215,"I know, Dad. You were disappointed
that I couldn't be you."
1216,FATHER,1216,"I was disappointed... that you
tried."
1217,EAMES,1217,"Come on, come on..."
1218,COBB,1218,That's the kick-you have to go!
1219,ARIADNE,1219,You're coming!
1220,COBB,1220,"No, I'm not. I'm staying here to
find Saito."
1221,COBB,1221,And to say goodbye.
1222,ARIADNE,1222,"Don't lose yourself. Find Saito.
And bring him back."
1223,COBB,1223,I will.
1224,MAL,1224,"We'd be together forever. You
promised me."
1225,COBB,1225,"I know. But we can't. And I'm
sorry."
1226,MAL,1226,"You remember when you asked me to
marry you? You said you dreamt that
we'd grow old together."
1227,COBB,1227,And we did...
1228,COBB,1228,"I miss you more than I can bear...
but we had our time together. And
now I have to let go..."
1229,BROWNING,1229,"I'm sorry, Robert."
1230,FISCHER,1230,"The will means that Dad wanted me
to be my own man, not live for him."
1231,FISCHER,1231,"And I'm going to, Uncle Peter."
1232,ARTHUR,1232,What happened?
1233,ARIADNE,1233,Cobb stayed.
1234,ARTHUR,1234,With Mal?
1235,ARIADNE,1235,No. To find Saito.
1236,ARTHUR,1236,He'll be lost...
1237,ARIADNE,1237,No. He'll be alright.
1238,SAITO,1238,So... have you come to kill me?
1239,SAITO,1239,"I've been waiting for someone to
come for me..."
1240,COBB,1240,"Someone from your half-remembered
dream...?"
1241,SAITO,1241,"Cobb? Not possible-he and I were
young men together. And I am an old
man..."
1242,COBB,1242,Filled with regret?
1243,SAITO,1243,"Waiting to die alone, yes."
1244,COBB,1244,"I came back for you... I came to
remind you of what you once knew..."
1245,COBB,1245,That this world is not real.
1246,SAITO,1246,"You came to convince me to honor
our arrangement?"
1247,COBB,1247,Yes. And to take a leap of faith.
1248,COBB,1248,"Come back and we'll be young men
together again."
1249,FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.),1249,"Hot towel, sir?"
1250,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,1250,"We'll be landing in Los Angeles in
about twenty minutes. Do you need
immigration forms?"
