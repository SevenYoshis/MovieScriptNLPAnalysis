Easy."

Good luck.

7,AUCTION MAN 3,7,Whoa! Whoa!
8,AUCTION MAN 3,8,"AUCTION MAN 3 (CONT'D)
Easy..."
9,DAD,9,Now that's a beauty.
10,SI EASTON,10,"Forget it, Ted. He's half
thoroughbred and not got a day's
work in him.
(points to a plow horse next to"
11,JOEY),11,"Now, there... There's your ticket."
12,DAD,12,"But look at him, Si. Look at that creature.
4."
13,SI EASTON,13,"Don't be daft. You need something
solid to plow a field."
14,DAD,14,"(fixed on Joey)
Yeah, but he's something else, that one."
15,AUCTIONEER,15,"Alright gentlemen - settle down - settle
down - horses on my right - men with money
in their pockets on my left - it's the
perfect combination. Is Fred Goddard here?"
16,FRED,16,YES! I's here.
17,AUCTIONEER,17,Good - more money than sense. Dave Hill?
18,DAVE,18,I'm here. Yes!
19,AUCTIONEER,19,"Bugger off, you tight bastard - you've been
coming here for 20 years - never bought so
much as a pork scratching."
20,AUCTIONEER (CONT'D),20,"Okay - first up today - a gorgeous young
horse - prettiest thing I've seen since my
wife on our wedding day. Let's get going,
shall we? Who wants this wonderful creature."
21,DAD,21,"One guinea.
5."
22,AUCTIONEER,22,"One guinea, one guinea, one
guinea...
YOUNG ANDREW EASTON
I thought you needed a plow horse, Mister
Narracott."
23,AUCTIONEER,23,"Any advance on one guinea? Any
advance on one guinea?"
24,LYONS,24,Two guineas.
25,DAD,25,Three!
26,SI EASTON,26,"Ted Narracott - it's completely the wrong
animal."
27,DAD,27,"Si Easton - I'm not gonna let that
bastard see me off."
28,LYONS,28,Five guineas.
29,DAD,29,Six!
30,SI EASTON,30,Oh for the love of...!
31,LYONS,31,Seven.
32,DAD,32,Greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody.
33,(BIDDING),33,"Eight.
6."
34,SI EASTON,34,"Stop it - he's your landlord - you
can't be picking fights with him."
35,LYONS,35,Ten guineas.
36,SI EASTON,36,"You haven't got the money. Let's go
home - let's have a pint."
37,DAD,37,"Eleven guineas, sir, from as good a man as
any in this town."
38,AUCTIONEER,38,Do I hear twelve guineas? Twelve guineas?
39,SI EASTON,39,"That's top price for a workin'
animal. Ted! Save it for the shire!"
40,DAD,40,"There are big days and there are
small days. Which will it be?"
41,AUCTIONEER,41,Do I hear any advance on eleven guineas?
42,DAVID LYONS,42,"Just let him go, dad, I don't care
for him, he's too... jumpy."
43,LYONS,43,Shall we say - twenty five?
44,SI EASTON,44,"Well, he's got you there. Nice try, Ted.
7."
45,ANDREW,45,"You were great, Mr N. Gave him a run
for his money."
46,AUCTIONEER,46,"Going, going..."
47,DAD,47,Thirty. Thirty guineas!
48,AUCTIONEER,48,"Thirty guineas. Thirty guineas. Going
going gone - to Mister Ted Narracott."
49,SI EASTON,49,"What have you done, Ted? What have you done?"
50,LYONS,50,"Quite a beast, there. But what you gonna do
with him - on a working farm? I hope you
got the rent, Ted. I'll be around for it
when it comes due."
51,SI EASTON,51,"You're a fool, Ted. And our Rosie'll
never forgive you."
52,SI EASTON,52,8.
53,SI EASTON,53,"MRS. NARRACOTT
What have you done?"
54,ALBERT,54,"That's Mooney's colt!
MRS. NARRACOTT
You were supposed to buy a plow horse."
55,ALBERT,55,"You bought him?
MRS. NARRACOTT
What'd you pay for him?"
56,ALBERT,56,"MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
How much, Ted Narracott?"
57,DAD,57,"I won't tell you a lie - though I would love
to. Thirty guineas.
MRS. NARRACOTT
Thirty guineas!"
58,DAD,58,"MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
He's not worth ten! Are you out of your
mind? What about the rent?"
59,DAD,59,"He's a strong one, Rosie. Look at
the way he holds his head!
MRS. NARRACOTT
How the hell are we gonna pull anything with
that? Ted - you have to take him back. You
have to take him back right now now."
60,ALBERT,60,"No.
9.
MRS. NARRACOTT
You have to get down on your knees and beg
for our money back."
61,ALBERT,61,"No. No, please don't take him back."
62,DAD,62,"We can't take him back till he's broken in.
MRS. NARRACOTT
And how are you gonna train a horse with
that leg?"
63,ALBERT,63,"I'll train him.
MRS. NARRACOTT
No, you stay out of this, Albie. You don't
know nothing about horses."
64,ALBERT,64,"Please, Mum. Please let me. I can do it."
65,DAD,65,"We have to keep him. We've no choice.
MRS. NARRACOTT
Right. Well... you've got one month to
break him in or I'm taking him back myself.
(She turns to the house,
but then...)
How did you get to thirty - what other fool
bid you up that high?"
66,DAD,66,It was Lyons.
67,DAD,67,"MRS. NARRACOTT
We're gonna lose everything. After all we've
been through - we're gonna lose it all."
68,DAD,68,10.
69,ALBIE,69,"Don't worry, Mum - I'll raise him - and I'll
raise him good.
MRS. NARRACOTT
Well, you better. Go on - get started. See
if a child can undo what your fool of a
father's done to this family of ours."
70,ALBERT,70,Right. Let's make a start then.
71,ALBERT (CONT'D),71,"It's oats. Very tasty, that is. It's
beef and gravy to us!"
72,ALBERT (CONT'D),72,Come on...
73,ALBERT (CONT'D),73,"I bet you're missing your mother.
Look at you... first time without
your mum. First time away from home.
But you're not alone, are you. In
fact. Cos I'm `ere..."
74,ALBERT (CONT'D),74,"It's alright. It's alright.
11."
75,ALBERT (CONT'D),75,"I'm gonna call you Joey. Understand? Joey.
That's you. And I'm Albert. It's alright,
You're mine now. You're mine."
76,ALBERT,76,"Whoa. I want you to stay there,
Joey. Stay. That's it. Good boy.
That's it, you've got it."
77,ANDREW,77,"Hey, look at him, Albie. He's
playing ""Grandma's Footsteps."""
78,ALBERT,78,"Right, come on, Joey. Back you go.
Come on. Back you go."
79,(MORE),79,12.
80,ALBERT (CONT'D),80,"You're all right. That's it. Good
boy. Right. You've gotta stay
there, understand?"
81,ALBERT (CONT'D),81,"That's it. Good boy. You've got it.
Good boy."
82,ANDREW,82,Good boy. Good.
83,(TO ALBERT),83,Now call him. Whistle.
84,ALBERT,84,"Come now, Joey. Come on."
85,ALBERT (CONT'D),85,"You can come now, Joey."
86,ANDREW,86,Don't think he fancies your owls.
87,ALBERT,87,"No, I read it in a story. It's how
the Indians used to summon their
horses."
88,ALBERT (CONT'D),88,"Now, Joey, when I whistle, you've
gotta come, understand?"
89,ANDREW,89,"My dad had a dog who stayed when you
called him. He used to run up
behind you when you weren't
looking, and uh..."
90,ALBERT,90,"He's not a dog. He's just puzzling
it through.
13."
91,ANDREW,91,Brilliant. Look at you.
92,ANDREW,92,"MRS. NARRACOTT
Albie."
93,LYONS,93,There's only fifteen here.
94,DAD,94,The rest will come.
95,LYONS,95,"You know by rights I could take this farm
back today, don't you? And I'm a great
believer in my rights."
96,DAD,96,It will come.
97,LYONS,97,"If you drank less beer and bought fewer
horses you might be able to look your
landlord in the eye, Narracott."
98,LYONS,98,14.
99,DAD,99,"I said I'll pay you. We got to plant the
bottom field."
100,LYONS,100,"Bottom field's rock hard. Only stones down
there."
101,DAD,101,"No, we're going to plow it. Just give me
`til the autumn. I'll pay every penny I owe
you. With interest."
102,LYONS,102,"How you going to plow it? Not with that
fancy animal of yours?"
103,DAD,103,He'll do it.
104,LYONS,104,"You'll not get that one in a harness, let
alone pulling a plow. Even drunk on a
Tuesday night, you know that. And I can't
wait for the money - there's a war coming."
105,DAD,105,"I promise you that field will be plowed.
We'll plant it with turnips. And the money
will be yours when harvest comes."
106,DAD,106,"MRS. NARRACOTT
Please, sir. Please."
107,LYONS,107,"Very well - if that fancy plows that field
I'll give you till October to set things
straight."
108,ALBERT,108,What if he doesn't?
109,LYONS,109,I'll take the horse on the day he fails.
110,"(BEAT)
(MORE)",110,15.
111,LYONS (CONT'D),111,"And I'll take your father's farm and give it
to working men who can hold their pints and
hold their heads high in decent company."
112,ALBERT,112,"No, please. Sir, you can't do that."
113,LYONS,113,"Now, now, now, lad. What - are you bladdered
as well?! Ted Narracott - I got you down in
my book!"
114,ALBERT,114,You can't harness him.
115,DAD,115,He's got to be collared.
116,ALBERT,116,"No, you can't. Look, you're scaring him,
Dad. You're scaring him. He..."
117,(DESPERATE),117,He can't take a plow!
118,DAD,118,"He's got to plow!
16."
119,ALBERT,119,"He won't be able to do it - he's too young -
he's not even been backed yet...."
120,ALBERT,120,"MRS. NARRACOTT
Ted!"
121,ALBERT,121,"It's alright, boy. It's alright. It's
alright. It's alright."
122,ALBERT,122,"MRS. NARRACOTT
I knew this would happen soon as I laid eyes
on him...."
123,ALBERT,123,"MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
Ted. No. Ted, no!"
124,DAD,124,"He's worth nothing to me! If he won't take
the collar, he's not worth a damn thing!"
125,ALBERT,125,Dad?
126,DAD,126,Move aside.
127,ALBERT,127,Dad. Stop.
128,ALBERT,128,"MRS. NARRACOTT
You shoot that horse we have nothing.
17."
129,ALBERT,129,"MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
NO!"
130,ALBERT,130,"You were right what you said, Dad. ""He'll do
it,"" you told Lyons, ""He'll plow that
field."" And he will! You'll see. He'll show
you. We'll show you. We'll get it done."
131,MUM,131,Let go. Let go.
132,MUM (CONT'D),132,Go back to the house.
133,MUM (CONT'D),133,"MRS. NARRACOTT
Here, here. Some days are best forgotten.
Today ain't one of them. Come on."
134,ALBERT,134,"How are you today, Joey? I don't know much
about life, boy, but I do know that there
are big days and there are small days. And
most days are small days, and, well, they
don't matter much to anyone - but this -
well, this is a big one. This is our big
day. Well, it's cold out there. So I'm going
to take this off -
(he takes off his coat)
Well, if it's tough for you - it should be
tough for me, too...
18."
135,ALBERT (CONT'D),135,"Now, I'm gonna teach you how to plow
and you're gonna learn. Is that
understood? And then we can be
together, which is how I believe
things are meant to be."
136,ALBERT (CONT'D),136,"Boy. Steady, boy. Here we go. Here
we go."
137,ALBERT (CONT'D),137,"Easy, easy... Look at me, Joey. See?
See? You've just gotta put your nose
through."
138,ALBERT (CONT'D),138,"That's it. See? You've got it.
You've got it. Good boy. There..."
139,SI EASTON,139,"Too large, too rocky, matted with
grass roots. Even a sturdy plow
horse'd never manage it alone.
19."
140,ANDREW,140,"Yet he will, I say."
141,SI EASTON,141,"You'd swear he'd sprout wings and
fly if Albert had told you so.
(smiling at his son:)
It's a fine thing, loyal to your
mate. Even if he is a bit barmy. A
team of two might manage, given a
month and good weather."
142,LYONS,142,"Ted too squeamish to watch, is he?"
143,SI EASTON,143,`Course he's watching.
144,LYONS,144,"Well, you've raised him up a true
Narracott, Ted, picture of his
father, he is: not a dollop of
ordinary sense but that thick
stubbornness that'll lead him to
insist on the impossible."
145,LYONS (CONT'D),145,"Wasn't a farmer in Devon didn't
admire you, myself among `em,
leaving your brothers that fine farm
and setting yourself at this stoney
patch of unpromising ground. You've
fettle enough for twenty men, but
with a gimpy leg and the drinking -
for the pain, isn't it, that you
drink?"
146,(MORE),146,20.
147,LYONS (CONT'D),147,"- yeah, none of us could have
anticipated an ending better than
this. Makes me question the wisdom
of the charity that urged me to rent
you this place, not only looking at
you, me old pal, but that pretty
little wife of yours, thought you
were a spark, she did."
148,"LYONS CONCLUDES:
LYONS (CONT'D)",148,"And now your son's sinking into the
selfsame bog that's swallowing you."
149,ALBERT,149,"See Joey - I got the collar, too!"
150,ALBERT (CONT'D),150,"Come on, boy. Walk on. That's it. Walk on!
Walk on, Joey. Come on, boy, walk on."
151,LYONS,151,"You'd be better off startin' at the
top of the hill and goin' down!
Gravity's the only friend you're
gonna have today, young lad."
152,ALBERT,152,"Walk on, Joey! Walk on! Come on,
Joey, walk on. Walk on, boy."
153,ALBERT (CONT'D),153,"Walk on. Come on, walk on."
154,"TED
(TO HIMSELF:)",154,"It'll take the whip to move him.
21."
155,LYONS,155,"Bravo! You've reached the top of the
hill! Off you go again, boy! You'll
make even better time comin' down!!"
156,ALBERT,156,"Good boy. Good lad. Good lad. Now
walk on. Good boy."
157,ANDREW,157,"Albie, we're all with ya!"
158,LYONS,158,"Look look look! The plow hasn't even cut
yet!"
159,LYONS,159,22.
160,ALBERT,160,"Do you know - I believe we can do
it, Joey. I knew when I first saw
you that you'd be the best of us.
That's why he bought you. He knows
you've all the courage he never had.
I knew when I first saw you that
you'd be the one who'd save us."
161,ALBERT (CONT'D),161,Whoa. Whoa.
162,LYONS,162,"You've got no chance, lad. He'll not
turn over half an acre. Give it up
now. You've done well. You've tried
hard. You're more of a man than your
father."
163,SI EASTON,163,"Come on now, Mr. Lyons, that's a bit
rough, isn't it?"
164,"LYONS
(A SHRUG:)",164,"Well, he'll destroy that horse."
165,LYONS (CONT'D),165,"I'll be over Thursday. Give you a
day to close it up."
166,LYONS (CONT'D),166,23.
167,NEIGHBOUR,167,Your wool.
168,(THEN),168,"I'm sorry, Rosie."
169,ALBERT,169,"Now, boy! You've got to do it, Joey.
You don't know, so I'm gonna have to
do the knowing for you when the rest
of our lives depend on this! So get
set to pull - and pull straight! And
pull hard!"
170,ALBERT (CONT'D),170,"Now, boy! Go!"
171,ALBERT (CONT'D),171,"Walk on, Joey! Walk on! That's it!
Good boy, Joey! Good boy!"

on, Joey!"
173,"ANDREW (CONT'D)
(YELLING)",173,Go around it!!
174,ALBERT,174,"Whoa, Joey! Whoa, Joey! Joey! Joey,
whoa whoa whoa! Joey, stop! You'll
break the blade -
24."
175,ANDREW,175,Will you look at you?
176,"SAYS:
LYONS",176,"I'd not let a child of mine slip in
the mud alongside a plow blade. He
could lose a foot!"
177,ROSIE NARRACOTT,177,"You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr.
Lyons, if you carry on prating at me
how to manage my son! Or my plow, or
my horse, or my field, or my farm!"
178,ROSIE NARRACOTT,178,"MRS. NARRACOTT
Come on, Albie! Push on through!"
179,ANDREW,179,"Get it done, Albie! Get it done!
25."
180,ROSIE,180,"Oh, my pair of fools. My mighty
fools."
181,ROSIE,181,You're as battered and bloodied as he is.
182,ALBERT,182,And where's Dad?
183,ROSIE,183,Still in the bottom field.
184,ALBERT,184,"Stumbling about, I suppose."
185,ROSIE,185,"It's not the drink, Albert, that
makes him stumble -
26."
186,"ALBERT
(ABRUPTLY)",186,"He drinks, mum."
187,ROSIE,187,"Well, so might you if you'd been
where he's been, seen what he's
seen!"
188,ALBERT,188,"Well, he don't talk to me about it."
189,ROSIE,189,"He don't talk about it because he
can't. There aren't words for some
things. Come here..."
190,ROSIE (CONT'D),190,The mice've been at it. Sit down.
191,ROSIE (CONT'D),191,"MRS. NARRACOTT
Here. It's his campaign pennant. He were
Sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial
Yeomanry."
192,ROSIE,192,"And that is the Queen's South Africa
Medal. Every man who fought in the
Boer War got one of those. But
this..."
193,ROSIE (CONT'D),193,"That's the Distinguished Conduct
Medal.
27."
194,ALBERT,194,Not dad's?
195,ROSIE,195,"Well it ain't mine, dear. He got
that after the fighting at
Transvaal. After he'd been hurt, and
he'd saved some other lads, and
well... I don't know what else, he
won't tell me either. But the first
day he got home he just... tossed
them out. First day he could walk,
he threw `em straight in the
dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word I
said not to."
196,ROSIE (CONT'D),196,"See, what you done today, you and
Joey, you're chuffed up now, and so
you should be, my splendid boy. It's
good to be proud when you done
something good. But what he done, in
Africa, whatever it was, he takes no
pride in it. Hard as it surely was,
and however much pain it's cost him,
he refuses to be proud of killing, I
suppose."
197,"ALBERT
(CONFUSED:)",197,"I'd be proud. If I'd gone off to
war. If I'd gone and saved my
mates, and -"
198,ROSIE,198,"Well, whether or not you think you'd
do the same thing as him... Think
how brave he is for refusing to be
proud."
199,ROSIE,199,28.
200,ROSIE (CONT'D),200,"Oh, your dad makes mistakes. And he
drinks to forget the mistakes that
he's made - but he never gave up and
he does that for us. And today, you
showed the world it's all been worth
it."
201,ROSIE (CONT'D),201,"You keep looking after Joey and
he'll always be looking after you."
202,"ALBERT
(SOFTLY:)",202,"Sergeant, Seventh Battalion,

(amazed, to Joey:)
You see this, Joey? It's been
through an entire war."

back to him, someday."

the village. No one else drives but
me."
206,YOUNG WOMAN,206,"Oh, yeah?"
207,DAVID,207,"That's right and this is my dad's
car. You're lucky that you're in
it. I'm not normally allowed to
drive it `cause it's so -"
208,YOUNG WOMAN,208,Is he a friend of yours?
209,ALBERT,209,"Come on, boy, let's show her how to
fly!"

213,ALBERT,213,"We can try planting something else, or we
could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob."

rent?"
215,ALBERT (CONT'D),215,31.
216,ALBERT (CONT'D),216,"MRS. NARRACOTT

217,DAD,217,"I used to believe that God gave each man his
fair portion of bad luck. I don't feel that
any more. I've had more than my share."

blame you when you do."

231,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,231,I'll give you twenty and not a penny more.
232,DAD,232,"Twenty is no good to me, Captain. Thirty
five and he's yours."
233,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,233,I don't even know how he rides.
234,DAD,234,"Oh, he rides... Splendidly. You'll
be astonished. I promise you that.
(his heart's in his
throat, fighting back"
235,GRIEF),235,"Finest horse in all of Devon. Finest
horse I ever seen."
236,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,236,Thank you.
237,ALBERT,237,"You can't! You can't, he's mine! I trained
him!
34."
238,DAD,238,Albert.
239,ALBERT,239,"You can't have him. He's my horse, sir."
240,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,240,"I'm afraid it's too late, lad. I've just
paid thirty guineas for him."
241,"ALBERT
(TO TED:)",241,"Please, I'll get you money. I will,
I'll get you money. I'll...I'll work
for it! I'll work for it."
242,(TO NICHOLLS:),242,"He won't obey anyone else. He won't
be any good in the war, neither.
He...he shies at every sound!"
243,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,243,I'm sorry.
244,ALBERT,244,"Well, if Joey's going, I'm going,
too. I'm volunteering."
245,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,245,"I see. What's your name, lad?"
246,ALBERT,246,"Albert, sir."
247,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,247,"And how old are you, Albert?"
248,ALBERT,248,"Nineteen, sir."
249,CAPTAIN NICHOLS,249,Is that the truth?
250,ALBERT,250,"No sir. But, but I look nineteen and
I'm bigger than most nineteen-year-
olds, sir! And I'm strong, sir! And
I...I'm not afraid of anything."
251,NICHOLLS INTERJECTS:,251,35.
252,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,252,"I don't doubt your qualifications,
Albert, but the law is very clear
about the proper age for soldiering,
and your father's done what he had
to do. You know that. Thirty guineas
isn't nearly enough to purchase a
horse as fine as your Joey, I know
that. But it's all I've got. Will
you lease him to me, Albert, to be
my own mount?
(he removes his cap,"
253,EARNEST),253,"I promise you, man to man, that I'll
look after him as closely as you've
done, I'll respect him and all the
care that you've taken with him. And
if I can - I'll return him to your
care."
254,EARNEST),254,"CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
Now say goodbye."
255,ALBERT,255,"It's all right, boy..."
256,SAM PERKINS,256,"All right, turn it in, eh? That's enough.
He's a horse, not a dog. Now, on your way."
257,(TO JOEY),257,Come on.
258,DAD,258,"Do you want to lose the farm, Rose?"
259,ROSIE,259,It's the way you did it.
260,DAD,260,"But we're at war.
36."
261,ROSIE,261,Aren't we just.
262,ALBERT,262,Joey...
263,SAM PERKINS,263,"Here now, I've told you - sling your
hook!"
264,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,264,"Let him be, Perkins."
265,ALBERT,265,"This isn't the end. This isn't the
end, my brother... I, Albert
Narracott, solemnly swear we will be
together again. Wherever you are, I
will find you. And I will bring you
home!"
266,ALBERT,266,37.
267,SAM PERKINS,267,"Whoa. Steady, steady. Steady now,
come on. Walk on! Walk on now,
come on!"
268,GROOM,268,Whoa whoa whoa. Easy easy...
269,SAM PERKINS,269,"Whoa whoa whoa, Joey! Stop muckin'
about, you hear? Yer in the army
now, son."
270,SAM PERKINS,270,"SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
Good boy, good boy. Steady
steady... Easy. Relax. Easy easy,
back up."
271,SAM PERKINS,271,"SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
Joey - meet Topthorn. Topthorn - this is
Joey. Sort out who's in charge between the
two of you, you hear? If you want to fight,
you get it over with - `cause once we're
over there, you're gonna need everything
you've got for Fritz!"
272,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,272,"Gently, Perkins. I don't want to sour him.
38."
273,SAM PERKINS,273,"There'll be nothing gentle about the war,
sir. And there'll be nothing gentle about
this one either!
SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
I understand that, Sergeant, but I
want him fit and shining. He's my
horse.
SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
Sir."
274,CHARLIE WAVERLY,274,Scares the living daylights out of me.
275,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,275,Who?
276,CHARLIE WAVERLY,276,Perkins. Glad he's on our side.
277,MAJOR STEWART,277,"Not bad. Not bad at all. Still not
a patch on my Topthorn."
278,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,278,"I wouldn't be so sure. I think he's got
potential. He's certainly got the bit
between his teeth."
279,CHARLIE WAVERLY,279,"I actually think my Blenheim is faster than
the pair of them."
280,MAJOR STEWART,280,Clear off!
281,MAJOR STEWART,281,"39.
MAJOR STEWART (CONT'D)
All right, gentlemen, listen here.
Everything tells us the same story, from
Waterloo to Omdurman, from Pickett's Charge
to the Battle of Mars La Tours - the first
attack can and should be the decisive one.
Perkins..."
282,SAM PERKINS,282,"Yes, sir!"
283,MAJOR STEWART,283,"No excuses, no mistakes - every
horse groomed and fit for
presentation! I want a full practice
charge tomorrow."
284,SAM PERKINS,284,Sir.
285,MAJOR STEWART,285,Thought you two had bottled out.
286,CHARLIE WAVERLY,286,As if.
287,MAJOR STEWART,287,"All right, then, let's see what you
two jokers are made of, shall we?
40."
288,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,288,This is what quiet confidence looks like.
289,CHARLIE WAVERLY,289,I'll wait for you two at the Duke of York.
290,MAJOR STEWART,290,"Over to you, Captain Nicholls."
291,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,291,Draw...swords!
292,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,292,"CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
Give...point!"
293,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,293,"CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
Charge!!!!"
294,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,294,"41.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
Come on, Joey. I know you've got
it. Come on, boy! Come on!"
295,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,295,"CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
Come on, boy!"
296,MAJOR STEWART,296,Whoa. Whoa.
297,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,297,Nice of you to turn up.
298,MAJOR STEWART,298,"He's got speed...I'll give him that. But
has he got stamina?"
299,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,299,He has everything.
300,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,300,42.
301,MAJOR STEWART,301,What are you up to?
302,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,302,I'm writing a letter.
303,MAJOR STEWART,303,With a picture in it?
304,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,304,"It's to the boy who owned Joey. I want to
show him how wonderful he's looking."
305,MAJOR STEWART,305,"Before we take him away across the Channel
to face a million Germans guns."
306,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,306,Yes. Before that...
307,MAJOR STEWART,307,"4 a.m. start tomorrow - travelling with the
Dragoon Guards and the Royals. Transport
detachment - they'll need to be at the docks
at 5 am. Check all kit. Battle orders: no
polishing - buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup
irons - let `em all go dull. I want nothing
to flash in the sun and give us away."
308,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,308,Of course.
309,MAJOR STEWART,309,Charlie...
310,CHARLIE WAVERLY,310,Jamie.
311,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,311,"Charlie.
43."
312,CHARLIE WAVERLY,312,What do you think of the cap?
313,CHARLIE WAVERLY,313,"CHARLIE WAVERLY (CONT'D)
Silk lining. I quite like it."
314,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,314,"I'm not sure it's going to make a lot of
difference to the Germans."
315,CHARLIE WAVERLY,315,"Oh, I don't know about that. Think about it -
you're a Boche, just working out which of
two chaps to shoot - and you thought - ""Good
Lord - one of them really is wearing a very
stylish cap indeed!"" You might shoot the
other one instead."
316,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,316,"Or, alternatively, think - ""I fancy that
cap"" and kill you first of all."
317,CHARLIE WAVERLY,317,Hadn't thought of that.
318,CHARLIE WAVERLY,318,44.
319,CHARLIE WAVERLY,319,"SGT. MAJOR SINGH
That is our target - the German 11th
Division - at the moment bivouacked three
miles to the east of the Menin Road. We have
been watching them and they have pitched
tents for the night and lit cooking fires.
Knock them out - and we could slide in
behind the German lines and come at them
from the South at Geluveld."
320,MAJOR STEWART,320,Excellent.
321,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,321,"Numbers?
SGT. MAJOR SINGH
About six hundred. Infantry."
322,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,322,Twice our size...
323,MAJOR STEWART,323,"In regiments of horse and men, the
advantage is ours.
SGT. MAJOR SINGH
And we have surprise on our side.
But the sooner we move, the better -
we have no assurance they'll still
be there tomorrow morning."
324,MAJOR STEWART,324,"Right. Good. So - today it is.
Charlie - tell the men."
325,CHARLIE WAVERLY,325,"Salisbury formation?
45."
326,MAJOR STEWART,326,"Salisbury formation. We'll charge
through them and secure the ground
behind.
SGT. MAJOR SINGH
The grass to the left is taller than
we are - it's perfect cover."
327,MAJOR STEWART,327,"Excellent work, Sergeant Major.
Time spent on reconnaissance is
rarely wasted."
328,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,328,"Thank you, Singh."
329,(CALLING AFTER),329,Jamie!
330,(CALLING AFTER),330,"CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
They have no idea we're coming."
331,MAJOR STEWART,331,"Not having scruples, are you, Jim?"
332,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,332,"No. I understand the surprise is
everything. But if it must be done,
let's do it quickly."
333,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,333,"CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
Are you alright, Charlie?"
334,CHARLIE WAVERLY,334,"Never been better. Literally, never
better."
335,MAJOR STEWART,335,Prepare to mount! Mount!
336,MAJOR STEWART,336,46.
337,CAPTAIN NICHOLLS,337,"Thank you, Standley."
338,(TO JOEY),338,"Hey, Joey. My bonny boy. You're
all right, aren't you, Joey? Hey?"
339,MAJOR STEWART,339,"Gentleman. It is an honour to ride
beside you. Make the Kaiser rue the
day he dared to cross swords with
us. Let every man make himself, his
King, his country, and his fallen
comrades proud! Be brave. Fear
God. Honor the King!"
340,TROOPERS,340,"(in unison shout)

What do we do with the horses?"
351,GERMAN OFFICER,351,"If they're injured, shoot them.
JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER
And the others, sir?"
352,GERMAN OFFICER,352,"The others you round up and take to
base camp - they will pull guns."
353,THIRD OFFICER,353,"You'll never get fancy horses like
these to pull guns."
354,GERMAN OFFICER,354,Then shoot them also.
355,GUNTHER,355,"Sir - perhaps we could use some of
them with the ambulances - to get
the injured men off the field."
356,GERMAN OFFICER,356,Will they take the harness?
357,GUNTHER,357,"I'd like to try, sir."
358,GUNTHER,358,50.

360,GUNTHER,360,Let's try.
361,MICHAEL,361,You won't get the harness on.

Easy now, easy."

over there?"

373,ALBERT,373,"It's a sketchbook...

That's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook!
See that? That's a picture of Joey!"

never!"

I'm keeping you here. You are best
with the horses and we need to move
the camp quickly if the enemy
continue to push through from the
west."

BASE CAMP OFFICER
I'm told. We will move later when we
find where the horses are needed
most."
390,GUNTHER,390,"Yes, sir. Perhaps I can keep my
brother here with me, he's also very
good with horses.

Oh no no. Not necessary."
391,(TO MICHAEL),391,Get moving. We leave tonight.
392,MICHAEL,392,"It's all right, Gunther."

how to fold a shirt."

now! I promised her, I made her a
solemn promise, that you would be
safe with me. With me, Michael!!"

stay here - slip underneath the bed -
until they move out."

399,MICHAEL (CONT'D),399,"Gunther, it will be fine. And when
all the machines break down and they
call up the horses, I'll see you at
the front. We'll be together again."

401,GUNTHER,401,I'm giving this to you. For luck.

over there - a wind so strong it
will lift you off the ground..."

you aren't worried but it's clear
you are. I know the war is
approaching but you say, ""Oh, it's
just a trick of the wind."""

Do you think I'll die if you tell me
the truth?"

with respect."

war, I will tell you the truth about

hands on his hips)
Now - who is the one telling lies!"
446,GRANDFATHER,446,In the windmill?

windmill waiting for Don Quixote.
This is François (Joey) and this is

449,EMILIE,449,"I named them after two boys who
broke my heart last Summer."

like this don't just appear from a

not unicorns - so I will be fair and
wait -- one day."

night-time, then they belong to me."

484,GERMAN SOLDIER,484,"A pot is a pot. We'll find some use
for it. Sir, where's the livestock?"
485,GRANDFATHER,485,I make jam. We have no animals.
486,GERMAN SOLDIER,486,But there's fresh hay in your barn.
487,EMILIE,487,"We use it to replace the mattress
stuffings."
488,GERMAN SOLDIER,488,"Her grandfather?
66."
489,GRANDFATHER,489,Yes.
490,GERMAN SOLDIER,490,Where are her parents?
491,"EMILIE
(BREAKING IN)",491,They're dead. They died.
492,GERMAN SOLDIER,492,What is that?
493,GRANDFATHER,493,"The wind. It plays tricks in the
attic."
494,BRANDT,494,There is no wind.
495,GRANDFATHER,495,An old house creaks.
496,(TO EMILIE),496,Go - close the shutters.
497,GERMAN SOLDIER,497,"She's sickly, no?"
498,GRANDFATHER,498,"If you or any of your friends harm
her, as old as I am, I will kill
you."
499,GERMAN SOLDIER,499,"You know, I was going to give you
back your pot. But now I'm going to
keep it. For soup."
500,GERMAN SOLDIER,500,67.
501,BRANDT,501,We will be back in the new season.
502,EMILIE,502,"Tell me what happened to them. To my
mother and father."
503,EMILIE (CONT'D),503,"You said you would tell me how they
died. On my birthday. And tomorrow's
my birthday! They died fighting,
didn't they? But when the soldiers"
504,EMILIE (CONT'D),504,"- you do nothing. You are a coward,
aren't you?"
505,GRANDFATHER,505,"Yes. Yes. It was your parents who
were brave. I make jams."
506,EMILIE,506,"And you've never done a brave thing
in your life?"
507,GRANDFATHER,507,"Maybe there are different ways to be
brave. Did you know the French have
the best carrier pigeons? And this
could be the difference in the war -
our messages getting through.
68."
508,EMILIE,508,"I don't want to hear about the
birds."
509,GRANDFATHER,509,"They are released at the front and
told to go home - this is all they
know. But to get there they must
fly over a war. Can you imagine
such a thing? Here you are flying
over so much pain and terror - and
you know you can never look down.
You have to look forward or you'll
never get home. I ask you - what
could be braver than that?"
510,EMILIE,510,What is that?
511,GRANDFATHER,511,A present.
512,EMILIE,512,"I hope you have not bought me a
disgusting dress that I then have to
wear like last year."
513,"GRANDFATHER
(LAUGHING)",513,It was disgusting?
514,EMILIE,514,"Yes. I looked like an ugly nun.
69."
515,EMILIE (CONT'D),515,"Give me your hand.
(she takes it in hers)
Grandpére, we have no money. When
the war is over, then you can buy me
jewels and carriages."
516,GRANDFATHER,516,"Anything you say, my sweet one.
Anything-you-say! You are, of
course, the boss. It's just an old
thing I found - don't worry yourself
- leave it, I'll put it back."
517,GRANDFATHER,517,"It was your mother's. I hid it, so
as not to encourage you. Emilie, I
want you to ride very slowly, very
carefully. And promise me you won't
go far --"
518,EMILIE,518,"Of course. Okay, I promise."
519,GRANDFATHER,519,"To the top of the hill and straight
back again."
520,EMILIE,520,I promise.
521,EMILIE,521,70.
522,EMILIE (CONT'D),522,My hero.
523,GRANDFATHER,523,Slowly...slowly...
524,GRANDFATHER (CONT'D),524,Emilie!
525,GRANDFATHER (CONT'D),525,Emilie!
526,EMILIE,526,"No! Let go of me! No!
71."
527,GRANDFATHER,527,"She is my granddaughter! Emilie,
stop! Don't hurt her, please!
Don't hurt her."
528,EMILIE,528,"You don't need them! There are so
many others!"
529,GRANDFATHER,529,"Please, take the bigger one and
leave the smaller one. You are
breaking my granddaughter's heart."
530,"BRANDT
(LEAVING)",530,"The war has taken everything from
everyone."
531,"GRANDFATHER
(CALLING AFTER)",531,What will happen to them?
532,BRANDT,532,They will pull artillery until they
533,"DIE -
EMILIE
(COUGHING)",533,François!
534,BRANDT,534,- or until the war is over.
535,GRANDFATHER,535,It will never be over!
536,BRANDT,536,You have your answer then.
537,BRANDT,537,72.
538,BRANDT,538,Heiglemann - these are yours.
539,FRIEDRICH,539,"Yes, sir."
540,BRANDT,540,"They look strong - should last a
month or two."
541,FRIEDRICH,541,You are beautiful.
542,FRIEDRICH (CONT'D),542,It's a pity they found you.
543,FRIEDRICH (CONT'D),543,Such a pity...
544,FRIEDRICH (CONT'D),544,73.
545,ARTILLERY OFFICER,545,Pull together!
546,ARTILLERY SOLDIER,546,Halt! Halt! Stop!
547,FRIEDRICH,547,Stop! Stop!
548,BRANDT,548,"Heiglemann, bring up another one!"
549,ARTILLERY OFFICER,549,"Heiglemann, bring up another horse!"
550,BRANDT,550,That one!
551,BRANDT (CONT'D),551,"No, no. The big black one!"
552,BRANDT (CONT'D),552,74.
553,FRIEDRICH,553,"He's a good horse, sir. But if you
move him up to the heavy gun, he
will be no use at all. Prince is
already losing condition. His leg,
sir."
554,BRANDT,554,You have given them names?
555,FRIEDRICH,555,"Yes, sir."
556,BRANDT,556,"You should never give a name to
anything you are certain to lose."
557,FRIEDRICH,557,"His leg is not good enough, sir."
558,BRANDT,558,"Private, you will do as you are
told."
559,(CALLING OFF),559,Hook him up.
560,FRIEDRICH,560,"As you see, sir, this one is
stronger."
561,BRANDT,561,Hook him up.
562,BRANDT,562,75.
563,OFFICER,563,Halt! Halt! Take the horses away!
564,ARTILLERY OFFICER,564,Shell!
565,ARTILLERY OFFICER,565,"ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
And load!"
566,ARTILLERY OFFICER,566,"ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
Back! Case!"
567,ARTILLERY OFFICER,567,"ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
Position!"
568,ARTILLERY OFFICER,568,"ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
And...fire!"
569,ARTILLERY OFFICER,569,76.
570,SERGEANT MARTIN,570,"Valuables in the bucket, lads. If
you live, you'll get them back. If
you live, you'll get them back.
Good lads."
571,ANDREW,571,"Maybe it's a drill, Albie. Maybe
it's a drill like last time."
572,ANDREW,572,77.
573,DAVID,573,Love letter?
574,ALBERT,574,That's my business.
575,DAVID,575,"I hear you and your mate were doing
bird imitations again. You gonna
write a letter to your horse?"
576,DAVID (CONT'D),576,"After you find your horse, I've lost
my needle in a haystack, and I could
use some help."
577,DAVID (CONT'D),577,"Anything valuable. Anyone who comes
back gets to share it out."
578,"ALBERT
(TO ANDREW)",578,Stay here.
579,ALBERT (CONT'D),579,"Remember that day me and Joey raced
you in your car?"
580,DAVID,580,"I remember you somersaulting through
the air."
581,ALBERT,581,Who was that girl you were with?
582,DAVID,582,There was a girl?
583,ALBERT,583,"There was. Don't you remember?
78."
584,DAVID,584,"It was just some girl, I suppose. I
don't recall which one. I do
remember you falling on your bum in
a ditch."
585,DAVID (CONT'D),585,"You see? Always entertaining,
Narracott, I'll give you that."
586,ANDREW,586,You did that? You fell on your bum?
587,SERGEANT MARTIN,587,"Be ready! Be ready! Let's go, men,
get ready to go! Get ready to move
out! Stay in position!"
588,DAVID,588,"Hold your nerve, boys. Remember,
it's not far to go. There's a way
through.
(he moves down the line)
Run fast, keep your wits about you,
keep your eyes open and God and the
King will keep an eye on you.
Company will fix bayonets! Fix
bayonets!"
589,ALBERT,589,"You know what it reminds me of out
there?
79."
590,ANDREW,590,What?
591,ALBERT,591,"That bloody impossible lower field
the day me and Joey plowed it. Best
day of my life that was and you were
there."
592,ANDREW,592,"And this here is the worst day of my
life, about to begin, and you're
here cheering me on. Us two, always.
And him."
593,DAVID,593,"Once you're in no man's land, go to
the flanks. Stay on the flanks."
594,SOLDIER,594,"Yes, sir."
595,DAVID,595,"Come on, boys, come on. To the
ladder!"
596,"ALBERT
(TO ANDREW)",596,"Stick close to the gentry, that's
our ticket, yeah? We have the pluck
but they have the luck."
597,DAVID,597,"You, too, Narracott."
598,(TO ANDREW),598,"And you, too."
599,(TO ANDREW),599,80.
600,DAVID (CONT'D),600,"Come on, on your ladders, boy. On
your ladders. In you go, in you go.
That's it."
601,SERGEANT MARTIN,601,Listen to your sergeant!
602,SERGEANT MARTIN,602,"SERGEANT MARTIN (CONT'D)
If anybody turns back, if any one of
our boys come running towards you -
you take this rifle and you shoot
them dead. Do you understand?"
603,SOLDIERS,603,"Yes, sir!"
604,SERGEANT,604,"Do you understand me? Do you
understand what I'm telling you,
son? You take this rifle and you
shoot them dead. Understand?"
605,SERGEANT (CONT'D),605,"Up there, son. Up your ladder. Up
your ladder to your work!"
606,ALBERT,606,"It's good. Andrew, it's good.
Andrew! Nobody's retreating today.
Andrew! Andrew! Nobody. Is
retreating. Today."
607,ALBERT,607,81.
608,DAVID,608,I'm shot! No!
609,DAVID (CONT'D),609,Just leave me. Leave me!
610,ALBERT,610,"You'll be all right here. You'll be
safe. Someone'll come for ya."
611,DAVID,611,"Albert. Albert, listen..."
612,ALBERT,612,"It's all right. It's all right.
We're Devon boys, yeah?"
613,DAVID,613,Yeah...
614,DAVID,614,82.
615,RANDOM SOLDIER,615,Get down!
616,ANDREW,616,"NO!
83."
617,ANDREW (CONT'D),617,Albie.
618,ALBERT,618,We made it. We made it.
619,ALBERT (CONT'D),619,"Andrew, this way out!"
620,SOLDIER,620,Gas! Gas! Gas!
621,ANDREW,621,Albie...
622,GERMAN OFFICER,622,"Hey, there's no stopping here. Keep
them moving.
84."
623,FRIEDRICH,623,"Sir, there's something wrong. This
one needs to rest."
624,GERMAN OFFICER,624,"There's no rest for them. Move them
along. Move them along!"
625,FRIEDRICH,625,"Please, please, please. Stay on
your feet. No, please. No no no..."
626,FRIEDRICH (CONT'D),626,Please please... Stay on your feet.
627,"DECLINE:
FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)",627,Come on. Please please...
628,GERMAN OFFICER,628,"They're coming! Leave it, private!"
629,GERMAN OFFICER,629,"85.
GERMAN OFFICER (CONT'D)
Leave it! Come with me!"
630,FRIEDRICH,630,Go to hell!
631,FRIEDRICH (CONT'D),631,Run. Run! Run! Run!
632,FRIEDRICH (CONT'D),632,86.
633,FRIEDRICH (CONT'D),633,"GEORDIE SOLDIER (O.S.)
Stand to, stand to -"
634,FRIEDRICH (CONT'D),634,"GEORDIE SOLDIER (CONT'D)
There's something moving."
635,SOLDIER,635,What the hell is it?
636,GEORDIE SOLDIER,636,It looks like a cow.
637,SOLDIER,637,"What the hell would a cow be doing out
there?"
638,SOLDIER 2,638,That definitely isn't a cow.
639,SOLDIER,639,"(handing over periscope)
Well, what is it?
87."
640,SECOND GERMAN,640,"It can't be a horse. Nothing alive could be
out there."
641,THIRD GERMAN,641,It isn't a horse. It isn't a horse.
642,SECOND GERMAN,642,Yes - it's a horse.
643,THIRD GERMAN,643,It's a horse.
644,PETER,644,"Yeah, it's a horse."
645,BRITISH CAPTAIN,645,"Well, bugger me. It's a horse."
646,GEORDIE SOLDIER,646,"Lads, we should call him."
647,BRITISH SOLDIER,647,How do you call a horse?
648,BRITISH SOLDIER,648,88.
649,PETER,649,He's caught on the wire.
650,GEORDIE SOLDIER,650,Oh sod it...
651,BRITISH CAPTAIN,651,"What do you think you're doing? Get
back, do you hear me? Corporal,
that's an order! Get back!"
652,BRITISH SOLDIER,652,"Listen to him, sir. We can't leave him."
653,PETER,653,What's he doing?
654,SECOND GERMAN,654,It's a trap.
655,PETER,655,"No, I don't think so. I think he's
trying to help."
656,THIRD GERMAN,656,Scare him back into his hole.
657,THIRD GERMAN,657,89.
658,GEORDIE,658,"It's a white flag, ent it? You see
the white flag!? I'm just after
tending to this here horse, is all!"
659,BRITISH CAPTAIN,659,"Get back, you stupid git!"
660,GEORDIE,660,"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
want, he leadeth me into green
pastures, he lay me down beside the
still waters..."
661,GEORDIE (CONT'D),661,"Poor beastie. Poor babbie. It's
alright. It's alright. Don't buck
and wriggle so, you're only
shredding yourself."
662,GEORDIE (CONT'D),662,You'll blind yourself.
663,GEORDIE (CONT'D),663,90.
664,GEORDIE (CONT'D),664,"Bugger me worthless - I didn't think
to bring gloves or something to cut"
665,GEORDIE (CONT'D),665,OW! DAMN! OW!!
666,PETER,666,"I thought perhaps you might need
these."
667,PETER (CONT'D),667,For the barbed wire?
668,GEORDIE,668,"Yeah, yeah I... Ummm, thanks.
Cheers. Cheers..."
669,GEORDIE (CONT'D),669,Thanks.
670,PETER,670,"That...That's a very long strand.
When you cut it, it's going to
release this -"
671,"ENTANGLED:
PETER (CONT'D)",671,"- and this, and this, and they'll
coil back rather violently, which
I'm afraid will only wound the poor
fellow further.
91."
672,GEORDIE,672,You speak good English.
673,PETER,673,"I speak English well.
(re: the cutters)
May I?"
674,PETER (CONT'D),674,"What if we cut his head free first?
So he won't try to stand up and
blind himself? And then -"
675,GEORDIE,675,"Pity you didn't bring a second pair.
Then I could cut the wire here -"
676,PETER,676,WE NEED MORE WIRE CUTTERS!
677,PETER (CONT'D),677,"His blind spot. The cutters won't
frighten him. If you could cut
here, holding this wire -"
678,PETER (CONT'D),678,92.
679,PETER (CONT'D),679,I could -
680,GEORDIE,680,"Say no more, I'm right behind you."
681,GEORDIE (CONT'D),681,"And you understand what's happening,
do you not, O Best Beloved? That you
must lay so very nice and still.
There's a lad, you're a remarkable
horse, you are, helping us help you.
There's a lad. There's a remarkable
lad."
682,GEORDIE (CONT'D),682,So how's things in yonder trench?
683,PETER,683,"Delightful. We read, we knit
sweaters, and we train our rats to
perform circus tricks."
684,GEORDIE,684,"Well, if ever you need any more
rats, we can always send ours over.
`Cause we've more than we need,
strictly speaking. Besides, they
scare off all the pretty girls."
685,PETER,685,Our girls aren't afraid of rats.
686,GEORDIE,686,"Big strapping German girls, eh? Kind
what gives robust massages?"
687,PETER,687,"Every Thursday! And they bring rum
cake on your birthday."
688,PETER,688,93.
689,GEORDIE,689,"Look at that horse! Look at the
muscles he's got, them long legs.
They're made for running, horses.
Runnin' away from danger."
690,PETER,690,Running away is all they have.
691,GEORDIE,691,"Yet we taught `em opposite. Running
into the fray."
692,PETER,692,War horse.
693,GEORDIE,693,"Yeah. War horse. And there he is.
What a strange beast you've become."
694,PETER,694,And now?
695,GEORDIE,695,"I take him back with me, yeah?"
696,PETER,696,"Since I supplied the cutters, the
horse is mine. This is fair, no?"
697,GEORDIE,697,"In a pig's eye. He's English, plain
to see."
698,PETER,698,"Oh, you mean because he's so filthy?"
699,GEORDIE,699,"Because he's so smart. And you're
none too clean yourself.
94."
700,PETER,700,"We could box. And the winner gets
the horse."
701,GEORDIE,701,"No, thanks, pet. Must be careful not
to start a war.
(patting his pockets:)
Do you have a coin of any sort?"
702,PETER,702,Coin toss?
703,GEORDIE,703,Yeah.
704,GEORDIE (CONT'D),704,"All right, Fritz - you're on."
705,PETER,705,My name is not Fritz - it is Peter.
706,GEORDIE,706,Peter - I'm Colin.
707,PETER,707,"You call it, Colin."
708,GEORDIE,708,Heads.
709,PETER,709,"That's the face of my Kaiser and he does not
look pleased with me. The horse is yours."
710,GEORDIE,710,"Gone quiet, hasn't it?"
711,PETER,711,Yes.
712,"(PAUSE)
(MORE)",712,95.
713,PETER (CONT'D),713,"But wait half an hour and we'll be shooting
again."
714,GEORDIE,714,"I'm a terrible shot, Pete, don't believe
I'll ever hit the target."
715,PETER,715,Thanks.
716,PETER (CONT'D),716,"Cheerio, mate."
717,(RE JOEY:),717,"You'll take good care of him, yes?"
718,GEORDIE,718,I will.
719,PETER,719,Our strange beast.
720,GEORDIE,720,"And you take care of your own
strange self."
721,PETER,721,"Colin! A pair of German cutters - in memory
of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf."
722,GEORDIE,722,Thanks.
723,GEORDIE (CONT'D),723,"I'll use `em back in the garden in
South Shields. You keep your head
down, now, Pete me lad!"
724,PETER,724,Remarkable! A remarkable horse!
725,PETER,725,96.
726,SERGEANT MARTIN,726,We're full up. Move on.
727,DAVID,727,"The gas got him - we had to wait
till morning."
728,MEDICAL OFFICER,728,This can't be all of us.
729,SERGEANT MARTIN,729,"This is all.
(bellowing to the men)
All walking wounded, away to the
dressing station! Away to the
dressing station!"
730,SERGEANT MARTIN,730,97.
731,DOCTOR,731,What's this doing here?
732,GEORDIE,732,"We need a vet, sir."
733,DOCTOR,733,"There are no vets. We've scarcely
any horses left."
734,GEORDIE,734,"He's cut all over, but this leg
here's got the worst of it."
735,DOCTOR,735,It's probably tetanus. It's no good.
736,GEORDIE,736,"Please, sir -"
737,DOCTOR,737,"I've all these men to take care of,
corporal, you can see that, can't
you?"
738,GEORDIE,738,"Please, sir, this horse can pull
through anything."
739,ALBERT,739,"What is it?
98."
740,AN ORDERLY,740,"It's a horse they found, wandering about in
No Man's Land.
(easing him back onto a"
741,COT),741,Down you go.
742,ALBERT,742,What kind of an horse?
743,AN ORDERLY,743,"Bloody miraculous kind of an horse,
be my guess. Nothing makes it out
of No Man's Land."
744,ALBERT,744,Miraculous horse...
745,GEORDIE,745,"(to the doctor:)
He was alive, y'see, sir, where
nothing survives, so to me and me
mates, to the men, sir, he's - Well,
we have high hopes for him -"
746,DOCTOR,746,You should shoot him now.
747,GEORDIE,747,"Oh, but I can't."
748,DOCTOR,748,"It'd be a mercy, lad, that leg's not
going to mend."
749,DOCTOR (CONT'D),749,"Sergeant. Put him out of his misery.
99."
750,SERGEANT FRY,750,"Ladies, if you please."
751,SERGEANT FRY,751,"SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)
All right, back off. Back off."
752,SOLDIER,752,Go on. Do it again.
753,ALBERT,753,Joey?
754,"ALBERT (CONT'D)
(SOFTLY:)",754,"Hello, Joey. Hello boy. Where you
been then, hey? Where in the world
you been?"
755,"ALBERT (CONT'D)
(SOFTLY:)",755,100.
756,DOCTOR,756,"(to the Geordie:)
Do you know this man?"
757,DOCTOR (CONT'D),757,What's your name?
758,ALBERT,758,"Narracott, Private Albert Narracott,
sir."
759,DOCTOR,759,"This is a random horse, Narracott,
and too badly injured.
(to the orderly)
Is this man in your care?"
760,AN ORDERLY,760,"Yes, sir."
761,ALBERT,761,"He's not random at all, sir! He's my
horse, I raised him, in Devon. Sir,
look at his legs! He's got four
white socks, he's brown all over -
(points to his own"
762,FOREHEAD),762,"- and he has a white mark here -
like so..."
763,DOCTOR,763,Take him back.
764,AN ORDERLY,764,"Come on, son."
765,GEORDIE,765,"Wait! You can't see `cause of the
mud."
766,GEORDIE,766,101.
767,GEORDIE (CONT'D),767,Four white socks!
768,SERGEANT FRY,768,"All right, break it up. Clear off,
the lot of ya."
769,ALBERT,769,"You see, sir? He's not random at
all."
770,DOCTOR,770,"We will attend to your horse. Patch
him up best we can. Treat him like
the soldier he is."
771,ALBERT,771,"Thank you, sir."
772,SERGEANT FRY,772,"Gentlemen! Gentlemen! It falls on me to give
you some important news. At eleven o'clock
today, in two minutes time - the War will
come to an end."
773,SERGEANT FRY,773,"SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)
The King and Queen thank you for your
service. We have been victorious - even if
at a higher price than many of us might have
imagined."
774,(MORE),774,"102.
SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)
When the bells ring out - and they will in a
moment, for the first time for four years -
let us remember our brothers fallen in the
field. And thank God for the end of this
struggle and victory."
775,ALBERT,775,"I don't understand, sir."
776,MAJOR TOMPKINS,776,"Officers' horses only. All other
horses are to be auctioned
immediately."
777,SERGEANT FRY,777,"That is a complete and bloody outrage. It's
the lad's horse, sir, from Devon. He raised
him up from a pup, he did. Trained him
right up to the day when the army came to
town."
778,MAJOR TOMPKINS,778,"These aren't my orders, sergeant."
779,(TO ALBERT),779,"You'll have to take him to market. That's
all."
780,GEORDIE,780,"We've all clubbed together. It's everything
we have. There's twenty-nine pounds there.
Buy him back.
103."
781,ALBERT,781,Does the Major know?
782,GEORDIE,782,The Major put in ten.
783,GEORDIE (CONT'D),783,"Mum's the word where the Major's
concerned. Your friend on the
crutches over there -"
784,GEORDIE (CONT'D),784,"- even asked the Major to say that
Joey was his, an officer's horse, so
that he could go back with the
others."
785,SERGEANT FRY,785,"Come on, Narracott! Get a move on. We don't
want to miss the show."
786,AUCTIONEER,786,"Seven pounds! Seven pounds there!
Seven pounds! Eight pounds here!"
787,AUCTIONEER (CONT'D),787,"Eight pounds! Ten pounds here! Any
advance? Sold!"
788,AUCTIONEER (CONT'D),788,104.
789,GEORDIE,789,"You're alright. Nobody's gonna bid more than
fifteen for a thoroughbred. They want work
horses."
790,AUCTIONEER,790,"Next one. We start at four pounds.
Four pounds."
791,THE BUTCHER,791,Eleven.
792,SERGEANT FRY,792,"It's the butcher from Cambrai. He's
been bidding for the best all
morning."
793,AUCTIONEER,793,Eleven. Eleven pounds. Eleven pounds.
794,SERGEANT FRY,794,"Let me handle this, private.
(he calls out) )
Fifteen, and let that be an end to it."
795,AUCTIONEER,795,Fifteen pounds.
796,BUTCHER,796,Sixteen.
797,AUCTIONEER,797,Sixteen pounds.
798,SERGEANT FRY,798,Seventeen.
799,BUTCHER,799,"Twenty of your English pounds. And let THAT
be the end of it, my friend.
105."
800,AUCTIONEER,800,Twenty pounds.
801,SERGEANT FRY,801,Twenty Five.
802,AUCTIONEER,802,Twenty five pounds.
803,BUTCHER,803,Twenty Six.
804,AUCTIONEER,804,Twenty six pounds.
805,SERGEANT FRY,805,Twenty seven.
806,BUTCHER,806,Twenty eight.
807,AUCTIONEER,807,Twenty eight pounds.
808,SERGEANT FRY,808,Twenty nine.
809,BUTCHER,809,And thirty.
810,AUCTIONEER,810,Any advance at thirty pounds?
811,FINAL BIDDER,811,One hundred pounds.
812,GRANDFATHER,812,"And sir, if you bid against me, I will sell
the coat on my back and bid to one hundred
and ten. And if you bid against me again, I
will sell my farm and bid to a thousand."
813,GRANDFATHER,813,106.
814,AUCTIONEER,814,"One hundred pounds. Going, going,
gone."
815,ALBERT,815,"Sir, I'll give you all your money.
Everything you paid when we get back
to England. I'll give you twice -"
816,GRANDFATHER,816,You don't know anything about him.
817,ALBERT,817,"Oh, but you're wrong, sir, I know
everything!"
818,GRANDFATHER,818,"Yes, you found him! I heard you
found a horse in the wire between
the armies -"
819,GEORDIE,819,"No, I found him, he raised him -"
820,GRANDFATHER,820,"When I heard about the miracle
horse, I traveled three days because
I knew whose horse it was. My
granddaughter's. She saved his life!
He was everything to her."
821,GEORDIE,821,Where is your granddaughter?
822,GRANDFATHER,822,"The war has taken everything from
everyone. He is all that I have left
of her."
823,GRANDFATHER,823,107.
824,ALBERT,824,"Don't be worried, boy, when I go. I
won't worry over you none. Hey, I
found you, didn't I, and you found
me."
825,ALBERT (CONT'D),825,"And we'll both... we'll both know
that we made it through. Now go on."
826,ALBERT (CONT'D),826,"We're the lucky ones. Always have
been. Lucky since the day I met you."
827,ALBERT (CONT'D),827,"God be with you, sir."
828,GRANDFATHER,828,Do you know what this is?
829,ALBERT,829,"It's my father's. It's his
regimental pennant. How did you come
by this, sir?"
830,GRANDFATHER,830,You may have this.
831,ALBERT,831,"Thank you ever so much for this,
sir...
108."
832,GRANDFATHER,832,"(with a sigh)
... And this."
833,GRANDFATHER (CONT'D),833,"No no, not necessary. He belongs to
you. That is, of course, what my
little girl would have wanted. And
she was the boss."
834,ALBERT,834,What was her name?
835,GRANDFATHER,835,"Emilie.
(turns back with a smile)
Her name is Emilie."
836,GRANDFATHER,836,109.
