0,WOODWARD,0,"No, no trouble, Harry, be right down."
1,WOODWARD,1,Son of a bitch.
2,ROSENFELD,2,"Where's that cheery face we've come
to know and love?"
3,WOODWARD,3,"You call me in on my day off because
some idiots have broken into local
Democratic Headquarters--tell me,
Harry, why should I be smiling?"
4,ROSENFELD,4,"As usual, that keen mind of yours
has pegged the situation perfectly."
5,ROSENFELD,5,"Except (a) it wasn't local Democratic
Headquarters, it was National
Democratic Headquarters--"
6,ROSENFELD,6,"--and (b) these weren't just any
idiots, these were special idiots,
seeing as when they were arrested at
2:30 this morning, they were all
wearing business suits and Playtex
gloves and were carrying--"
7,ROSENFELD,7,"--a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of
film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized
tear gas guns, plus various bugging
devices."
8,ROSENFELD,8,"Not to mention over two thousand
dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred
dollar bills."
9,WOODWARD,9,"Preliminary hearing at Superior
Courthouse?"
10,ROSENFELD,10,"Two o'clock, work the phones 'til
you go."
11,WOODWARD,11,"Could you give me the names of the
lawyers for the men arrested in the
Watergate."
12,CLERK,12,These two were appointed--
13,CLERK,13,"--only now it turns out the burglars
got their own counsel."
14,FIRST ANGRY LAWYER,14,"When you gonna stop thinking it's so
funny."
15,SECOND ANGRY LAWYER,15,"We wouldda done a terrific job
protecting those guys."
16,FIRST ANGRY LAWYER,16,"You think we're not as good as some
hotshot fancy lawyer?--"
17,WOODWARD,17,"Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward,
I'm from the Post and I wanted to
ask about how you happened to come
on this case--"
18,CADDY,18,--I'm not here.
19,WOODWARD,19,OK.
20,WOODWARD,20,"Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record,
when questioned about his presence
in the courtroom, denied he was in
the courtroom, ""I'm not here,"" Mr.
Caddy said."
21,CADDY,21,"Clearly, I am here, but only as an
individual, I'm not the attorney of
record."
22,CADDY,22,"Mr. Rafferty has that position.
Whatever you want, you'll have to
get from him, I have nothing more to
say."
23,WOODWARD,23,"Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four
Cuban-Americans and this other man,
James McCord."
24,CADDY,24,"Look, I told you inside--"
25,WOODWARD,25,"--you have nothing more to say, I
understand that."
26,WOODWARD,26,"What I don't understand is how you
got here."
27,CADDY,27,"I assure you, there's nothing
mysterious involved."
28,WOODWARD,28,"Probably you're right, but a little
while ago, I was talking to a couple
of lawyers who'd been assigned to
represent the burglars."
29,CADDY,29,So?
30,WOODWARD,30,"Well, they never would have been
assigned if anyone had known the
burglars had arranged for their own
counsel. And that could only mean
the burglars didn't arrange for their
own counsel--they never even made a
phone call."
31,WOODWARD,31,"So if they didn't ask for you to be
here, how did you know to come?"
32,WOODWARD,32,"Did you know to come because one of
the other men involved in the break-
in called you?"
33,CADDY,33,"There is no reason to assume other
people were involved."
34,WOODWARD,34,"Your clients were arrested with a
walkie-talkie; they didn't need that
to talk among themselves."
35,CADDY,35,They are not my clients.
36,WOODWARD,36,You're a lawyer and you're here--
37,CADDY,37,"--I met one of the defendants, Mr.
Barker, at a social occasion once--"
38,CADDY,38,--I have nothing more to say.
39,WOODWARD,39,A Miami social occasion?
40,WOODWARD,40,"Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were
from Miami."
41,CADDY,41,"Barker's wife called me at three
this morning; her husband apparently
had told her to call if he hadn't
called her by then."
42,WOODWARD,42,"It was really nice of you to come,
since you'd only met him once."
43,CADDY,43,"Are you implying you don't believe
me?"
44,WOODWARD,44,I have nothing more to say.
45,CADDY,45,"You don't mind getting on people's
nerves, do you?"
46,WOODWARD,46,Nope.
47,JUDGE,47,"Will you please state your
professions."
48,BARKER,48,Anti-Communists.
49,JUDGE,49,Anti-Communists?
50,JUDGE,50,"That, sir, is not your average
occupation."
51,JUDGE,51,"Your name, please."
52,MCCORD,52,James McCord.
53,JUDGE,53,"Will you step forward, sir."
54,JUDGE,54,"And what is your occupation, Mr.
McCord?"
55,MCCORD,55,Security consultant.
56,JUDGE,56,Where?
57,MCCORD,57,Government. Recently retired.
58,JUDGE,58,Where in government?
59,MCCORD,59,"...Central... Intelligence...
Agency..."
60,JUDGE,60,Where?
61,MCCORD,61,The C.I.A.
62,WOODWARD,62,Holy shit.
63,UNION POST EMPLOYEE,63,"""Five men, one of whom said he is a
former employee..."""
64,UNION POST EMPLOYEE,64,Schmucks.
65,FIRST VOICE (V.O.),65,"Hurry it, huh, Bachinski?"
66,BACHINSKI,66,You said I could look at it--
67,COP,67,"--I said look, not memorize--"
68,BACHINSKI,68,"--almost done, give it a rest, all
right..."
69,COP (V.O.),69,What'd you find?
70,BACHINSKI (V.O.),70,"Beats me. These notebooks belonged
to Cuban guys?"
71,COP (V.O.),71,S'right.
72,BACHINSKI (V.O.),72,"It's gotta mean either White House
or whore house, one or the other."
73,WOODWARD,73,Bachinski?
74,WOODWARD,74,What?--hold it--
75,WOODWARD,75,"--OK, go on, go on..."
76,ROSENFELD,76,"...go on, go on..."
77,WOODWARD,77,"That's everything Bachinski had, I
think it's worth following up."
78,ROSENFELD,78,"Don't know; who the hell's Howard
Hunt?"
79,ROSENFELD,79,"It's probably nothing but check it
out. Just go easy, it could be crazy
Cubans."
80,SIMONS,80,Anything?
81,ROSENFELD,81,"Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with
the break-in thing--absolute page
one stuff--"
82,SIMONS,82,"--in other words, you got nothing,
you're thumbsucking."
83,ROSENFELD,83,Could develop.
84,SIMONS,84,"Let me see what you get, but don't
jump--The New York Times thinks it's
crazy Cubans."
85,ROSENFELD,85,"OK, get on this W.House guy and do a
better job then you did on McCord."
86,WOODWARD,86,I did all right on McCord.
87,ROSENFELD,87,"Then how come the Associated Press
were the ones found out that Mr.
McCord is security coordinator for
the Committee to Re-elect the
President, otherwise known as CREEP?"
88,WOODWARD,88,"The head of security for the
reelection of a Republican President
got caught bugging the national
offices of the Democrats? What the
hell does that mean?"
89,ROSENFELD,89,"Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP,
says it means nothing."
90,ROSENFELD,90,"""...This man and the other people
involved were not operating on either
our behalf or with our consent. These
is no place in our campaign or in
the electoral process for this type
of activity, and we will not forget
it or condone it."""
91,WOODWARD,91,You can't believe that.
92,ROSENFELD,92,"As a rough rule of thumb, as far as
I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's
how much I trust John Mitchell..."
93,ROSENFELD,93,What'd you get on W.House?
94,WOODWARD,94,Lotsa hints--
95,ROSENFELD,95,I can't sell hints to Simons--
96,ROSENFELD,96,--you called everyone you know?
97,ROSENFELD,97,Call someone you don't know.
98,WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR (V.O.),98,White House.
99,WOODWARD,99,"Howard Hunt, please."
100,WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR (V.O.),100,Mr. Hunt does not answer.
101,WOODWARD,101,"Thanks, anyway--"
102,WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR (V.O.),102,"I'll bet he's in Mr. Colson's office.
Let me connect you."
103,SECRETARY (V.O.),103,Charles Colson's wire.
104,WOODWARD,104,"Howard Hunt, please."
105,SECRETARY (V.O.),105,Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.
106,WOODWARD,106,"Thanks, anyway."
107,SECRETARY (V.O.),107,"Have you tried Mullen and Company
Public Relations? He works at Mullen
and Company Public Relations as a
writer. The number is 555-1313. I'm
sorry I couldn't be more helpful."
108,WOODWARD,108,"Listen, forget it."
109,WOODWARD,109,Who's Charles Colson?
110,ROSENFELD,110,"I would liken your query to being in
Russia half a century ago and asking
someone, ""I understand who Lenin is
and Trotsky I got too, but who's
this yokel Stalin?"""
111,WOODWARD,111,"Who's Colson, Harry?"
112,ROSENFELD,112,"The most powerful man in America is
President Nixon, probably you've
heard his name."
113,ROSENFELD,113,"The second most powerful man is Robert
Haldeman. Just below him are a trio:
Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend,
and they protect the President from
everybody which is why they are
referred to as either The German
Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr.
Mitchell we've already discussed.
Mr. Colson is the President's special
counsel."
114,WOODWARD,114,"Thanks, Harry."
115,WOODWARD,115,Know anything about Colson?
116,ROSENFELD,116,"Just that on his office wall there's
a cartoon with a caption reading,
""When you've got them by the balls,
their hearts and minds will follow."""
117,WOODWARD,117,"Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing
Post and..."
118,WOODWARD,118,"Mullen and Company Public Relations?
Could you tell me when you expect
Mr. Hunt?"
119,WOODWARD,119,He is?
120,HUNT (V.O.),120,Howard Hunt here.
121,WOODWARD,121,"Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--"
122,HUNT (V.O.),122,"--yes, yes, what is it?"
123,WOODWARD,123,"I was just kind of wondering why
your name and phone number were in
the address books of two of the men
arrested at Watergate?"
124,HUNT (V.O.),124,Good God!
125,WOODWARD,125,"I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Bennett,
but we're doing some investigating
of one of your employees, Howard
Hunt."
126,BENNETT (V.O.),126,"Well, if you've been doing some
investigating then obviously it's no
secret to you that Howard was with
the C.I.A."
127,WOODWARD,127,No secret at all.
128,WOODWARD,128,"Hello, C.I.A. This is R.W. Woodward,
of the Washington Post--get me
Personnel--"
129,WOODWARD,129,"Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington
Post--and--what's that?--you've never
heard of me?--I can't help that--you
don't believe I'm with the Post?--
what do you want me to do, Madam,
shout ""extra--extra""?"
130,ROSENFELD,130,"Whaddya got, whaddya got?"
131,WOODWARD,131,Hunt is Colson's man--
132,WOODWARD,132,"--that's Charles Colson, Nixon's
special counsel--"
133,WOODWARD,133,--they both went to Brown University--
134,WOODWARD,134,"--Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till
'70, and this is on deep background,
the FBI thinks he's involved with
the break-in."
135,SIMONS,135,What else have you got?
136,WOODWARD,136,"According to White House personnel,
Hunt definitely works there as a
consultant for Colson. But when I
called the White House Press office,
they said he hadn't worked there for
three months. Then the P.R. guy said
the weirdest thing to me."
137,WOODWARD,137,"""I am convinced that neither Mr.
Colson nor anyone else at the White
House had any knowledge of, or
participation in, this deplorable
incident at the Democratic National
Committee."""
138,SIMONS,138,"Isn't that what you'd expect them to
say?"
139,WOODWARD,139,Absolutely.
140,ROSENFELD,140,So?
141,WOODWARD,141,"I never asked them about Watergate.
I only said what were Hunt's duties
at the White House. They volunteered
that he was innocent when nobody
asked was he guilty."
142,ROSENFELD,142,"I think we got a White House
consultant linked to the bugging."
143,SIMONS,143,Just be careful how you write it.
144,WOODWARD,144,Here's the first take--
145,WOODWARD,145,"This is all of it, Harry."
146,WOODWARD,146,We have to talk.
147,WOODWARD,147,"What the hell were you doing rewriting
my story--"
148,BERNSTEIN,148,"--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--"
149,WOODWARD,149,--it was fine the way it was--
150,BERNSTEIN,150,--it was bullshit the way it was--
151,WOODWARD,151,"--I have to stand here and listen to
the staff correspondent from Virginia?--"
152,BERNSTEIN,152,"--what have you been here, nine
months?--I been in this business
since I was sixteen--"
153,WOODWARD,153,"--and you've had some fucking meteoric
rise, that's for sure--by the time
you turn forty you might be the head
of the Montana bureau--"
154,BERNSTEIN,154,"--you only got the job because both
you and Bradlee went to Yale--"
155,WOODWARD,155,--Bradlee went to Harvard--
156,BERNSTEIN,156,"--they're all the same, all those
Ivy League places--they teach you
about striped ties and suddenly you're
smart--"
157,WOODWARD,157,"--I'm smart enough to know my story
was solid--"
158,BERNSTEIN,158,--mine's better--
159,WOODWARD,159,--no way--
160,BERNSTEIN,160,--read 'em both and you'll see--
161,WOODWARD,161,...crap...
162,BERNSTEIN,162,Is mine better?
163,WOODWARD,163,"What is it about my writing that's
so rotten?"
164,BERNSTEIN,164,"Mainly it has to do with your choice
of words."
165,WOODWARD (V.O.),165,Carl?
166,BERNSTEIN,166,Yeah?
167,WOODWARD,167,"Fuck you, Carl."
168,BERNSTEIN,168,You heard?
169,BERNSTEIN,169,"They put us both on the break-in
thing. Simons liked the way we worked
together."
170,BERNSTEIN,170,"Listen, I'm sorry I said your story
was bullshit."
171,WOODWARD,171,"It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a
failure."
172,BERNSTEIN,172,"Forget it, the main thing--"
173,BERNSTEIN,173,--did you call me a failure?
174,WOODWARD,174,I was sure trying.
175,WOODWARD,175,"All right, what do we know?"
176,BERNSTEIN,176,Let me lay a little theory on you--
177,WOODWARD,177,"--I'm not interested in theory. What
do we know? For example, Hunt's
disappeared."
178,BERNSTEIN,178,"Well, Barker tried to get blueprints
of the Miami Convention Center and
the air-conditioning system."
179,WOODWARD,179,"And McCord was carrying an application
for college press credentials for
the Democratic convention."
180,WOODWARD,180,"The Times has got to be full of it--
it can't be crazy Cubans."
181,BERNSTEIN,181,"What, though?"
182,BERNSTEIN,182,"It can't be the Republicans--he'd
never allow something as stupid as
this, not when he's gonna slaughter
McGovern anyway."
183,WOODWARD,183,"Right. Nixon didn't get where he got
by being dumb--"
184,WOODWARD,184,"--listen, that was a Watergate
question--"
185,NIXON,185,"The White House has had no involvement
whatever in this particular incident."
186,WOODWARD,186,Hey?
187,BERNSTEIN,187,Hmm.
188,WOODWARD,188,"What do you think he meant, this
particular incident? Were there
others? How would we find out? You
know anyone important?"
189,BERNSTEIN,189,"I lived here all my life, I got a
million contacts, but they're all
bus boys and bellhops."
190,RINGLE,190,What do you need?
191,BERNSTEIN,191,"Someone inside the White House would
be nice."
192,RINGLE,192,"Call her. She worked for Colson, if
that's any help."
193,GIRL,193,"Kenny's crazy, I never worked for
Colson, I worked for an assistant.
Colson was big on secrets anyway.
Even if I had worked for him, I
wouldn't have known anything."
194,BERNSTEIN,194,Nothing at all you can remember?
195,SECRETARY,195,Sorry.
196,SECRETARY,196,"Now if it was Hunt you were interested
in--"
197,BERNSTEIN,197,--Howard Hunt?
198,SECRETARY,198,"Sure. Him I liked, he was a very
nice person. Secretive too, traveled
all over, but a decent man."
199,BERNSTEIN,199,Any idea what he did?
200,SECRETARY,200,"Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was
he was investigating Kennedy--"
201,BERNSTEIN,201,--Teddy Kennedy?
202,SECRETARY,202,"Sure. I remember seeing a book about
Chappaquiddick on his desk and he
was always getting material out of
the White House Library and the
Library of Congress and--"
203,BERNSTEIN,203,"White House Library, please."
204,OPERATOR (V.O.),204,One moment.
205,LIBRARIAN (V.O.),205,Library.
206,BERNSTEIN,206,"Hi. Carl Bernstein of the Washington
Post. I was just wondering if you
remember the names of any of the
books that Howard Hunt checked out
on Senator Kennedy."
207,LIBRARIAN (V.O.),207,"I think I do remember, he took out a
whole bunch of material. Let me just
go see."
208,BERNSTEIN,208,--what do you think?--
209,WOODWARD,209,"--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary
consultant."
210,BERNSTEIN,210,"Maybe a political operative of some
sort--"
211,WOODWARD,211,"--a spy, you mean?"
212,BERNSTEIN,212,"It makes sense; Hunt worked for the
C.I.A. and the White House was
paranoid about Teddy Kennedy."
213,LIBRARIAN (V.O.),213,Mr. Bernstein?
214,BERNSTEIN,214,"Yes, ma'am."
215,LIBRARIAN (V.O.),215,"What I said before? I was wrong. The
truth is, I don't have a card that
Mr. Hunt took out any Kennedy
material."
216,LIBRARIAN (V.O.),216,"I remember getting that material out
for somebody, but it wasn't Mr. Hunt.
The truth is, I've never had any
requests at all from Mr. Hunt."
217,LIBRARIAN (V.O.),217,"The truth is, I don't know Mr. Hunt."
218,LIBRARIAN,218,"You want all the material requested
by the White House?"
219,LIBRARIAN,219,"All White House transactions are
confidential."
220,WOODWARD,220,"You think they are confidential? I
don't know anything about how this
town works, I haven't lived here a
year yet."
221,BERNSTEIN,221,We need a sympathetic face.
222,YOUNG CLERK,222,You want every request since when?
223,BERNSTEIN,223,"When did Hunt start at the White
House?"
224,WOODWARD,224,July of '71.
225,BERNSTEIN,225,About the past year.
226,CLERK,226,"I'm not sure you want 'em, but I got
'em."
227,CLERK,227,"I can't believe you guys are actually
doing this."
228,WOODWARD,228,"You do a lot of things when you're
on a story."
229,WOODWARD,229,"Can you believe we're actually doing
this?"
230,BERNSTEIN,230,That was fun.
231,BERNSTEIN,231,What now?
232,WOODWARD,232,"I met a Presidential aide once at a
social occasion."
233,BERNSTEIN,233,And you haven't called him?--
234,ROSENFELD,234,"You got accurate notes on the White
House librarian?"
235,ROSENFELD,235,"OK, we'll leave space for the White
House denial and we should be set."
236,ROSENFELD,236,"Benjy, we got a present for you.
Above the fold on page one for sure.
It may not change our lives one way
or the other. Just a good, solid
piece of American Journalism--"
237,ROSENFELD,237,"--that The New York Times doesn't
have."
238,BRADLEE,238,You haven't got it.
239,BRADLEE,239,"A librarian and a secretary say Hunt
looked at a book."
240,BRADLEE,240,Not good enough.
241,WOODWARD,241,"I was told by this guy at the White
House that Hunt was investigating
Teddy Kennedy."
242,BRADLEE,242,How senior?
243,WOODWARD,243,You asking me to disclose my source?
244,BRADLEE,244,Just tell me his title.
245,WOODWARD,245,I don't know titles.
246,BRADLEE,246,"Is he on the level of Assistant to
the President or not?"
247,BRADLEE,247,"Get some harder information next
time."
248,DEEP THROAT,248,I saw the flag signal--what's up?
249,WOODWARD,249,"Nothing, that's the problem--the
story's gone underground."
250,DEEP THROAT,250,You thought I'd help out on specifics?
251,DEEP THROAT,251,"I'll confirm what you get, try to
keep you on the right track, but
that's all."
252,DEEP THROAT,252,Are you guys really working?
253,DEEP THROAT,253,How much?
254,WOODWARD,254,"I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen
hours a day--we've got sources at
Justice, the FBI, but it's still
drying up."
255,DEEP THROAT,255,"Then there must be something, mustn't
there. Look, forget the myths the
media's created about the White House--
the truth is, these are not very
bright guys, and things got out of
hand."
256,WOODWARD,256,"If you don't like them, why won't
you be more concrete with me?"
257,DEEP THROAT,257,"Because the press stinks too--history
on the run, that's all you're
interested in."
258,DEEP THROAT,258,You come up with anything?
259,WOODWARD,259,"John Mitchell resigned as head of
CREEP to spend more time with his
family. That doesn't exactly have
the ring of truth."
260,WOODWARD,260,"Howard Hunt's been found--there was
talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand
in cash in a paper bag."
261,DEEP THROAT,261,"Follow the money. Always follow the
money."
262,WOODWARD,262,To where?
263,DEEP THROAT,263,Go on.
264,WOODWARD,264,"This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to
be tried along with Hunt and the
five burglars--we know he knows a
lot, we just don't know what."
265,DEEP THROAT,265,"You changed cabs? You're sure no one
followed you?"
266,WOODWARD,266,"I did everything you said, but it
all seemed--"
267,DEEP THROAT,267,--melodramatic?
268,DEEP THROAT,268,"Things are past that--remember, these
are men with switchblade mentalities
who run the world as if it were Dodge
City."
269,WOODWARD,269,"What's the whole thing about--do you
know?"
270,DEEP THROAT,270,"What I know, you'll have to find out
on your own."
271,WOODWARD,271,"Liddy--you think there's a chance
he'll talk?"
272,DEEP THROAT,272,"Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put
his hand over a candle. And he kept
it there. He kept it right in the
flame until his flesh seared. A woman
who was watching asked, ""What's the
trick?"" And he replied. ""The trick
is not minding."""
273,BERNSTEIN,273,What's that?
274,WOODWARD,274,The fucking New York Times.
275,BERNSTEIN,275,Goddamnit--
276,WOODWARD,276,--see?--
277,BERNSTEIN,277,--I'm trying--
278,WOODWARD,278,--fifteen phone calls--
279,BERNSTEIN,279,"---fifteen or more phone calls from
the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy
at CREEP--"
280,WOODWARD,280,Why didn't we get that?
281,BERNSTEIN,281,"Christ, and I even know somebody at
the phone company--"
282,WOODWARD,282,--you do?--with access to records?
283,BERNSTEIN,283,"Why couldn't you have just dialed me
from the office, Irwin?"
284,IRWIN,284,"'Cause I'm not calling out from the
phone company anymore--"
285,IRWIN,285,--I think the place is bugged.
286,BERNSTEIN,286,So tell me about the Times article.
287,IRWIN,287,What do you want to know?
288,BERNSTEIN,288,"No games, Irwin; give."
289,IRWIN,289,My big civil rights buddy--
290,IRWIN,290,"--boy, if John Mitchell was after
your phone records, would you be
screaming."
291,IRWIN,291,What're you onto?
292,BERNSTEIN,292,Something maybe big.
293,IRWIN,293,"And that makes anything you do OK,
is that it?"
294,BERNSTEIN,294,"Just tell me about the goddamn
article."
295,IRWIN,295,"It was accurate, but I can't get a
fuller listing for you--all Barker's
phone records have been subpoenaed."
296,BERNSTEIN,296,Who by?
297,IRWIN,297,"A Miami D.A. The guy doing the
investigating is named Martin Dardis."
298,BERNSTEIN,298,"Irwin? I really feel bad, doing
something like this--you know that,
don't you?"
299,IRWIN,299,"Don't give me any more of your liberal
shit, OK, Carl?"
300,BERNSTEIN,300,"Harry, I just talked to a Miami
investigator about Barker--"
301,ROSENFELD,301,--so?
302,BERNSTEIN,302,"I think it might be helpful if you'd
send me to Miami."
303,ROSENFELD,303,"I'm the one sent you to Toronto,
Bernstein--"
304,BERNSTEIN,304,--that was awhile ago--
305,ROSENFELD,305,"--""I think it might be helpful if
you'd send me to Toronto."" That was
your spiel then. ""The Lifestyles of
Deserters."""
306,ROSENFELD,306,I'm still waiting for it.
307,BERNSTEIN,307,"Down to Miami and back--how much
damage can I do?"
308,ROSENFELD,308,"You're the fella who forgot he rented
a Hertz car, do I have to tell you
they didn't forget to send us the
bill?"
309,ROSENFELD,309,"I can predict the next words you're
gonna say: ""anyone but Bernstein."""
310,ROSENFELD,310,I want to send a reporter to Miami.
311,SIMONS,311,Anyone but Bernstein.
312,ROSENFELD,312,Howard--
313,SIMONS,313,"--remember Toronto, Harry."
314,ROSENFELD,314,That was awhile ago.
315,SIMONS,315,"I don't get it--you were the one who
wanted to fire him."
316,ROSENFELD,316,"I know, I did, but damnit Howard--"
317,ROSENFELD,317,"For the first time since I've known
him, I think he's really humping..."
318,BERNSTEIN,318,Yeah?
319,BERNSTEIN,319,"Yes, this is Carl Bernstein."
320,BERNSTEIN,320,You're repossessing my bicycle?
321,BERNSTEIN,321,"Listen, I'm sure I paid this month's
installment, so why don't you check
your records before you go around
hassling people?"
322,BERNSTEIN,322,Oh...
323,BERNSTEIN,323,"Hannah, I never would have bothered
you but I'm off to Miami and they're
gonna take away my ten speed unless
I get it straightened out fast."
324,HANNAH,324,"Where are your bills, Carl?"
325,BERNSTEIN,325,"Oh, they're here."
326,BERNSTEIN,326,"I'm keeping much better records now,
Hannah."
327,BERNSTEIN,327,See?
328,HANNAH,328,"Carl, it's a jungle."
329,HANNAH,329,"I suggest you either pay this
immediately or lay in a large supply
of candles."
330,HANNAH,330,"You'd give a stranger the shirt off
your back--except it wouldn't be
paid for."
331,BERNSTEIN,331,Hey... very tense.
332,HANNAH,332,Lot of pressure at the Star.
333,HANNAH,333,"Carl, when we got married, you were
four thousand dollars in debt; when
we split, you were solvent. That may
prove to be the outstanding single
achievement of my life, and now look
at this."
334,HANNAH,334,How much did the damn bike cost?
335,BERNSTEIN,335,Five hundred; six maybe.
336,HANNAH,336,"You're two months behind--you got
enough to cover?"
337,BERNSTEIN,337,I think.
338,HANNAH,338,Give me your checkbook then.
339,BERNSTEIN,339,It's right under that pile.
340,HANNAH,340,I thought you had to get to Miami.
341,BERNSTEIN,341,There's always a later plane.
342,HANNAH,342,"You're a sex junkie, you know that,
Carl?"
343,BERNSTEIN,343,Nobody's perfect.
344,BERNSTEIN,344,"I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah--
you're a terrific reporter and I
turned you into a bookkeeper."
345,HANNAH,345,"Aw baby, you can get it up... I just
wonder if you'll ever be able to get
it together."
346,BERNSTEIN,346,"Hi, it's me. I'm still here."
347,SECRETARY,347,I'm so glad.
348,BERNSTEIN,348,I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
349,SECRETARY,349,And you will.
350,SECRETARY,350,But not now.
351,BERNSTEIN,351,"I called him from Washington. He's
the one who asked me to be here at
eleven in the morning."
352,SECRETARY,352,"I told you, he had to go out on a
case."
353,UNIFORMED COP,353,Is it OK to go on back?
354,BERNSTEIN,354,"Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car
radio?"
355,SECRETARY,355,He is not in the car.
356,SECRETARY,356,Sorry.
357,SECOND COP,357,"Hey, babe."
358,BERNSTEIN,358,"Mr. Dardis does call in every so
often?"
359,SECRETARY,359,Well of course.
360,BERNSTEIN,360,"Good. Just tell him I was here, that
I'm sorry I missed him--"
361,BERNSTEIN,361,"Mr. Dardis' office, please."
362,SECRETARY,362,Mr. Dardis' office.
363,BERNSTEIN,363,"This is Mr. Tomlinson in the clerk's
office. Could you come across the
hall for a moment? We've got some
documents your boss probably should
see."
364,VOICE (V.O.),364,Dardis.
365,BERNSTEIN,365,"Carl Bernstein's here to see you--I
don't know why, but he seems angry--"
366,BERNSTEIN,366,"Look, you've been jerking my chain
all day. If there's some reason you
can't talk to me--like the fact that
you've already leaked everything to
The New York Times--just say so."
367,DARDIS,367,"Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we
do this tomorrow?"
368,BERNSTEIN,368,I'm on deadline.
369,DARDIS,369,"You want Barker's phone stuff or his
money stuff?"
370,BERNSTEIN,370,Whatever.
371,DARDIS,371,I'll never get out of here in time.
372,BERNSTEIN,372,"The telephone calls... we know about
that."
373,DARDIS,373,"The rest is Barker's bank records.
It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand
in Mexican cashier's checks--"
374,BERNSTEIN,374,"--yeah, that was in The Times this
morning."
375,BERNSTEIN,375,What's this Dahlberg check?
376,DARDIS' VOICE,376,"That the twenty-five grand one?--
Don't know--"
377,DARDIS,377,"I never could figure just who this
Dahlberg was."
378,DARDIS,378,Think it might be anything?
379,BERNSTEIN,379,This?
380,BERNSTEIN,380,Naw...
381,BERNSTEIN,381,"--Woodward--Woodward, listen, I don't
know what I got--"
382,BERNSTEIN,382,--and I think the Times has it too--
383,BERNSTEIN,383,"--but somewhere there's a Kenneth H.
Dahlberg in this world and we've
gotta find him--"
384,RESEARCHER,384,"Were you after the Dahlberg articles
from the files?"
385,RESEARCHER,385,"There aren't any, sorry."
386,WOODWARD,386,Whazzis?
387,RESEARCHER,387,Our Dahlberg file.
388,BERNSTEIN'S VOICE (V.O.),388,Harry--I know how to get Dahlberg--
389,ROSENFELD,389,--Woodward's talking to him know.
390,WOODWARD,390,"--this should take only a minute,
Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow-
up on the break-in--"
391,WOODWARD,391,"--and I was kind of curious about
your check."
392,DAHLBERG (V.O.),392,...check...?
393,WOODWARD,393,The twenty-five thousand dollar one.
394,WOODWARD,394,The one with your name on it.
395,WOODWARD,395,In Bernard Barker's Florida account.
396,WOODWARD,396,"Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--"
397,DAHLBERG (V.O.),397,...you're definitely doing a story...?
398,WOODWARD,398,"Yes, sir."
399,DAHLBERG (V.O.),399,"I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent
man, I don't do anything that isn't
decent or proper."
400,DAHLBERG (V.O.),400,I know I shouldn't tell you this...
401,DAHLBERG (V.O.),401,"That twenty-five thousand dollars is
money I collected for Nixon in this
year's campaign."
402,WOODWARD,402,"I see. And how do you think it reached
Miami?"
403,DAHLBERG (V.O.),403,"I don't know; I really don't. The
last time I saw it was when I was in
Washington. I gave it to the Finance
department of the Committee to Re-
Elect the President. How it got to
that burglar, your guess is as good
as mine."
404,WOODWARD,404,"That checks out with our finding,
thank you, Mr. Dahlberg."
405,ROSENFELD,405,"CREEP financed the Watergate break-
in, Jesus Christ."
406,WOODWARD,406,One sec'--
407,SIMONS,407,"--OK, last go-round. Foreign, anything
else?"
408,SIMONS,408,National?
409,NATIONAL EDITOR,409,"I'll stand with the Eagleton follow-
ups and McGovern not being able to
get a replacement--that's your page
one stuff right there, Howard--"
410,SIMONS,410,--Metropolitan?--
411,ROSENFELD,411,"--you are ignoring the importance of
the Dahlberg repercussions--"
412,NATIONAL EDITOR,412,"--nobody gives a shit about the
Dahlberg repercussions--"
413,ROSENFELD,413,"--quit equivocating, say what you
mean--"
414,ROSENFELD,414,"--our story got Government Accounting
to start an audit on CREEP's finances--"
415,BRADLEE,415,"--and we printed that, didn't we,
Harry? And when the frigging audit's
done, we'll print that too--"
416,NATIONAL EDITOR,416,"--let me tell what happened when I
was having lunch today at the Sans
Souci--"
417,ROSENFELD,417,"--correction--when you were drinking
your lunch at the bar of the Sans
Souci--"
418,NATIONAL EDITOR,418,"--this White House guy, a good one,
a pro, came up and asked what is
this Watergate compulsion with you
guys and I said, well, we think it's
important and he said, if it's so
goddamn important, who the hell are
Woodward and Bernstein?"
419,ROSENFELD,419,"Ask him what he's really saying--he
means take the story away from
Woodstein and give it to his people
at the National Desk--"
420,NATIONAL EDITOR,420,"--well, I've got some pretty
experienced fellas sitting around,
wouldn't you say so?--"
421,ROSENFELD,421,"--absolutely--and that's all they
do, sit sit sit--every once in a
while, they call up a Senator, some
reporting--"
422,NATIONAL EDITOR,422,"--well, what if your boys get it
wrong--"
423,BRADLEE,423,"Then it's our asses, isn't it?"
424,SIMONS,424,"And we'll all have to go to work for
a living."
425,FOREIGN EDITOR,425,"I don't think either Metropolitan or
National should cover the story."
426,FOREIGN EDITOR,426,"I don't think we should cover the
story, period."
427,BRADLEE,427,Go on.
428,FOREIGN EDITOR,428,"It's not that we're using unnamed
sources that bothers me, or that
everything we print the White House
denies, or that almost no other papers
are reprinting our stuff."
429,SIMONS,429,What then?
430,FOREIGN EDITOR,430,"I don't believe the goddamn story,
Howard, it doesn't make sense."
431,BRADLEE,431,"It will, it just hasn't bottomed out
yet, give it time."
432,FOREIGN EDITOR,432,"Ben, Jesus, there are over two
thousand reporters in this town, are
there five on Watergate? Where did
we suddenly get all this wisdom?"
433,FOREIGN EDITOR,433,"Look--why would the Republicans do
it? --my God, McGovern is self-
destructing before our eyes--just
like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch
of 'em."
434,FOREIGN EDITOR,434,"Why would the burglars have put the
tape around the door instead of up
and down unless they wanted to get
caught? Why did they take a walkie-
talkie and then turn it off, unless
they wanted to get caught? Why would
they use McCord--the only direct
contact to the Republicans?"
435,BRADLEE,435,"You saying the Democrats bugged
themselves?"
436,FOREIGN EDITOR,436,"The FBI thinks it's possible--the
Democrats need a campaign issue,
corruption's always a good one."
437,FOREIGN EDITOR,437,"Get off the story, Ben--or put some
people on McGovern's finances; fair
is fair, even in our business."
438,UNION GUY,438,What'd'ya think?
439,SECOND UNION GUY,439,"Politics as usual, someone just got
caught with his hand in the cookie
jar, that's all."
440,UNION GUY,440,Big fuckin' cookie jar.
441,BERNSTEIN,441,"This is practically a high school
reunion for us, Jane--I would have
sprung for a classier place."
442,JANE,442,"Anyplace really public, they'd know
about it--they know everything at
the Committee, Carl--"
443,BERNSTEIN,443,"--you don't really think you're being
followed?"
444,JANE,444,"This girlfriend of mine at the
Committee, the other day she went
back to the D.A. to tell the things
the FBI didn't ask her. That night,
her boss, he knew what she'd done.
They control everything; that's how
they know it all."
445,BERNSTEIN,445,FBI too?
446,JANE,446,"You don't believe me? Well, I was
working the weekend of the break-in
and my God, all the executives were
running around like crazy--you had
to practically wait in line to use
the shredding machine--and when the
FBI came to investigate, they never
even asked me about it."
447,BERNSTEIN,447,"If you don't like it down there, why
don't you quit?"
448,JANE,448,I don't know what they'd do to me.
449,BERNSTEIN,449,"Hey, easy..."
450,JANE,450,"We're a long way from high school,
Carl..."
451,JANE,451,...and I'm scared.
452,JANE'S VOICE (O.S.),452,They found out I saw you--
453,JANE'S VOICE (O.S.),453,--they wanted to know everything.
454,JANE'S VOICE (O.S.),454,Don't call me again.
455,BERNSTEIN,455,I can help if you'll--
456,JANE (O.S.),456,"--stay away from me, Carl!"
457,CLERK,457,"We have no one by the name of Mitchell
registered."
458,WOODWARD,458,"My mistake, sorry."
459,WOODWARD,459,"Get me John Mitchell, it's urgent."
460,OPERATOR (V.O.),460,"That would be room 710, I'll connect
you."
461,MAN'S VOICE (V.O.),461,The Mitchells.
462,WOODWARD,462,"Can I speak to Martha Mitchell,
please."
463,MAN'S VOICE (V.O.),463,Who is this?
464,WOODWARD,464,"I've met Mrs. Mitchell in Washington,
I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and
tell her--"
465,FIRST MAID,465,We'll be back after lunch.
466,BLACK MAN,466,We'll be here.
467,SECOND MAID,467,I think they went out.
468,WOODWARD,468,I don't mind waiting.
469,BERNSTEIN,469,See her?
470,BERNSTEIN,470,Get anything?
471,WOODWARD,471,"For the paper, no; for us, plenty."
472,WOODWARD,472,"I waited a long time and finally
this big guy--I guess a bodyguard--
he left and I knocked and she
remembered me, we talked awhile."
473,BERNSTEIN,473,And?--And?--
474,WOODWARD,474,"--she was panicked, Carl--every time
I mentioned Watergate, you could
tell."
475,BERNSTEIN,475,Were you eyebrow reading?
476,WOODWARD,476,"It was there. I just don't get it; a
CREEP secretary being scared, that's
one thing. But what does the wife of
one of the most powerful men in
America have to be afraid of...?"
477,BERNSTEIN,477,Left up ahead.
478,WOODWARD,478,Who's first?
479,BERNSTEIN,479,"Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone
list, Miss Helen Abbott of South
George Street."
480,BERNSTEIN,480,Now hang your second right--
481,BERNSTEIN,481,--this was my turf when I was a kid.
482,BERNSTEIN (V.O.),482,"I brought you over one street too
many--go back and hang a left again."
483,BERNSTEIN,483,"I don't get it... this really was my
turf..."
484,WOODWARD,484,You're not a kid anymore.
485,BERNSTEIN,485,"My first day as a copy boy I was
sixteen and wearing my only grown-up
suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30
the head copy boy comes running up
to me and says, ""My God, haven't you
washed the carbon paper yet? If it's
not washed by three, it'll never by
dry for tomorrow."""
486,BERNSTEIN,486,"And I said, ""Am I supposed to do
that?"" and he said, ""Absolutely,
it's crucial."" So I run around and
grab all the carbon paper from all
the desks and take it to the men's
room. I'm standing there washing it
and it's splashing all over me and
the editor comes in to take a leak,
and he says, ""What the fuck do you
think you're doing?"" And I said,
""It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon
paper."""
487,BERNSTEIN,487,"Just wanted you to know I've done
dumber things than get us lost, that's
all."
488,WOODWARD,488,"Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington
Post and I hate to bother you at
home--"
489,SWEET OLD LADY,489,"--I already get the Post. I don't
need another subscription."
490,WOODWARD,490,"No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk
to you about the Committee to Re-
Elect."
491,SWEET OLD LADY,491,The what to what?
492,WOODWARD,492,"You work there, Miss Abbott."
493,SWEET OLD LADY,493,I'm not Miss Abbott.
494,WOODWARD,494,Miss Abbott?
495,MISS ABBOTT,495,Yes?
496,WOODWARD,496,"We're from the Washington Post and
we wanted to ask you some questions
about the Committee."
497,MISS ABBOTT,497,I'm sorry--
498,MIDDLE-AGED MAN,498,"God, it's just so awful--"
499,A YOUNG GIRL,499,--I can't--I'd like to but--
500,OLD MAN,500,"--go--you've got to go before they
see you--please--"
501,OLD WOMAN,501,--no... good...
502,BERNSTEIN,502,"You had the Mighty Mo and the fries
without gravy, right?"
503,WOODWARD,503,"This is terrific work, if you like
rejection."
504,BERNSTEIN,504,I never scared anyone before.
505,WOODWARD,505,"It's not us, they were scared before
we got there."
506,WOODWARD,506,What do we know?
507,BERNSTEIN,507,Facts or theory?
508,WOODWARD,508,Anything you've got.
509,BERNSTEIN,509,"We know there's got to be something
or they wouldn't be so panicked."
510,WOODWARD,510,"And that something's got to be more
than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five
burglars--those indictments are gonna
be bullshit when they come down.
What else do we know?"
511,BERNSTEIN,511,"I just wish we knew when someone
would talk to us, that's all."
512,WOODWARD,512,"A friend at the Committee told us to
contact you--"
513,WOMAN,513,--who was it?
514,BERNSTEIN,514,"We never reveal our sources, which
is why you can talk to us."
515,WOODWARD,515,"It's safe, try it, you'll see."
516,BERNSTEIN,516,We understand your problem--
517,WOODWARD,517,"--you believe in the President, you
wouldn't ever want to do anything
disloyal."
518,BERNSTEIN,518,We appreciate your position--really.
519,WOMAN,519,"You people--you think that you can
come into someone's life, squeeze
what you want, then get out."
520,WOMAN,520,"You don't appreciate a goddamn thing,
mister."
521,WOMAN,521,And you don't understand nothing.
522,WOMAN,522,"But the Committee's briefed us on
you--so get the hell out of here--"
523,WOMAN,523,"--do you like scaring the life out
of decent people?--'cause if you
don't, in the name of God--stop it!"
524,WOODWARD,524,"At Yale once, they held an auction.
There was this woman and her name
was Lulu Landis. Her postcards came
up for sale. She had 1400 postcards
written to her and I'd never heard
of her before but I knew I had to
have those cards, I had to know why
anyone would get so many messages. I
paid sixty-five dollars for them...
I got all crazy trying to work it
out and first it was just a maze but
then I found that her husband killed
himself in Dayton, and once I had
that, it all began to open, an
evangelist had come to Dayton and
his horses hit Lulu Landis at the
corner of 13th and Vermillion and
she was paralyzed. Permanently, and
her favorite thing til then had been
traveling and all her friends,
whenever they went anyplace, they
wrote her. Those cards, they were
her eyes..."
525,MIDDLE-AGED MAN,525,"I know who you are and I'm not afraid
but that don't mean I'll talk to you
either--you're just a couple Democrats
out to stop Nixon getting re-elected."
526,WOODWARD,526,Democrats?
527,MIDDLE-AGED MAN,527,That's right.
528,BERNSTEIN,528,I hate both parties.
529,WOODWARD,529,And I'm a Republican.
530,BERNSTEIN,530,Republican?
531,WOODWARD,531,Sure.
532,BERNSTEIN,532,Who'd you vote for?
533,WOODWARD,533,When?
534,BERNSTEIN,534,'68.
535,WOODWARD,535,Nixon.
536,MIDDLE-AGED MAN,536,"Mitchell never left the Committee--
he resigned, sure, but he was there
as much as before--"
537,YOUNGER MAN,537,"--oh, don't worry, Gordon Liddy will
be happy to take the fall for everyone
because, well, it's not that Gordon's
crazy, he's..."
538,YOUNGER MAN,538,"...weird. I'll give you some Committee
people who know about him--only don't
tell it was me--"
539,YOUNGER WOMAN,539,"--of course we were briefed on what
to say--and never to volunteer
anything--"
540,OLD WOMAN,540,"--oh, we were never alone with the
FBI, there was always someone from
the Committee right there--"
541,NIXON,541,"...No one in this administration,
presently employed, was involved in
this very bizarre incident..."
542,NIXON,542,"...What really hurts in matters of
this sort is not the fact that they
occur, because overzealous people in
campaigns do things that are wrong.
What really hurts is if you try to
cover it up."
543,WOODWARD,543,Did he just say what I think he said?
544,BERNSTEIN,544,You voted for him.
545,BERNSTEIN,545,"Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of the
Washington Post and--"
546,WOMAN,546,"--oh, you don't want me, you want my
sister."
547,WOMAN,547,For you.
548,BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER,548,This here is Carl Bernstein--
549,BOOKKEEPER,549,"--omigod, you're from that place,
you've got to go."
550,BERNSTEIN,550,Could I bum one of your cigarettes?--
551,BERNSTEIN,551,"--don't bother, I'll get it."
552,BOOKKEEPER,552,You've really got to go.
553,BERNSTEIN,553,Just let me get a match.
554,BERNSTEIN,554,"But I want you to know that I
understand why you're afraid--a lot
of good people down there at the
Committee are afraid. I'm really
sorry for what you're being put
through."
555,BOOKKEEPER,555,"All those articles you people write--
where do you find that stuff?"
556,BERNSTEIN,556,"We don't tell anyone that. Which is
why you can talk to us. And if we
can't verify what you say someplace
else, we don't print it. That's
another reason you can relax."
557,BOOKKEEPER,557,I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
558,BERNSTEIN,558,"You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper
when he worked for Maurice Stans at
Finance, and we were sort of
wondering, did you go work for Stans
immediately after Sloan quit or was
there a time lapse?"
559,BOOKKEEPER,559,I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
560,BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER,560,"Would you like some coffee or
anything?"
561,BERNSTEIN,561,"Please, yes, thank you."
562,BERNSTEIN,562,Can I sit down for a minute?
563,BOOKKEEPER,563,One minute but then--
564,BERNSTEIN,564,"--right, right, I've got to go."
565,BERNSTEIN,565,Why did you lie just then?
566,BERNSTEIN,566,"I was just curious--you don't do it
well, so I wondered. Have you been
threatened, if you told the truth,
is that it?"
567,BOOKKEEPER,567,...No... never in so many words...
568,BERNSTEIN,568,"It's obvious you want to talk to
someone--well, I'm someone."
569,BERNSTEIN,569,"I'm not even going to put your name
down. It's just so I can keep things
straight."
570,BERNSTEIN,570,"Start with the money, why don't you?"
571,BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER,571,How do you like it?
572,BERNSTEIN,572,"Everything, please."
573,BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER,573,I won't be a minute.
574,BERNSTEIN,574,"The General Accounting report said
there was a 350 thousand cash slush
fund in Stans' safe. Did you know
about that from the beginning?"
575,BOOKKEEPER,575,"There are too many people watching
me--they know I know a lot--"
576,BERNSTEIN,576,"--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?"
577,BOOKKEEPER,577,"A lot of it was. I just thought it
was sort of an all-purpose political
fund--you know, for taking fat cats
to dinner, things like that."
578,BERNSTEIN,578,"Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000
dollars."
579,BOOKKEEPER,579,"I can't be positive that it was used
for the break-in but people sure are
worried."
580,BERNSTEIN,580,Which people?
581,BOOKKEEPER,581,The ones who could disburse the money.
582,BERNSTEIN,582,Who were they?
583,BOOKKEEPER,583,"There were a group of them--I think
five, I don't know their names."
584,BERNSTEIN,584,"Sloan knew which five, didn't he?"
585,BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER,585,Here we are.
586,BOOKKEEPER,586,I don't want to say anymore.
587,BERNSTEIN,587,It's awfully hot--
588,BERNSTEIN,588,"--and you haven't finished telling
me about the money--"
589,BOOKKEEPER,589,"--omigod, there was so much of it,
six million came in one two-day period--
six million cash, we couldn't find
enough places to put it. I thought
it was all legal, I guess I did, til
after the break-in, when I remembered
Gordon got so much of it."
590,BERNSTEIN,590,"Gordon Liddy, you mean?"
591,BOOKKEEPER,591,"It was all so crazy--the day after
the break-in he gave us a speech,
bouncing up and down on his heels in
that loony way of his--Gordon told
us not to let Jim McCord ruin
everything--don't let one bad apple
spoil the barrel, he said. You just
know that when Gordon Liddy's calling
someone a bad apple, something's
wrong somewhere."
592,BOOKKEEPER,592,"...It's all so rotten... and getting
worse... and all I care about is
Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to
leave him if he didn't stand up and
do what was right. And he quit. He
quit because he saw it and didn't
want any part of it."
593,BERNSTEIN,593,"Think Sloan's being set up as a fall
guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it
looks that way."
594,BOOKKEEPER,594,"If you guys... if you guys could
just get John Mitchell... that would
be beautiful..."
595,BERNSTEIN,595,"I  couldn't believe what she told
me. Eight cups of coffee worth."
596,WOODWARD,596,"Go on, go on--"
597,BERNSTEIN,597,"--we've got to find out who the five
guys are--the five with access to
the slush fund--they were aware of
the break-in."
598,WOODWARD,598,"Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments
will just be bullshit."
599,BERNSTEIN,599,"It goes very high--we've got to find
out where--"
600,WOODWARD,600,--we will--
601,BERNSTEIN,601,"--she was really paranoid, the
bookkeeper."
602,WOODWARD,602,That happens to people.
603,WOODWARD,603,"OK, go on."
604,BERNSTEIN,604,How do you want to handle Sloan?
605,WOODWARD,605,"You mean, who's going to play the
mean M.P. and who's going to be the
nice one?"
606,WOODWARD,606,Whichever.
607,BERNSTEIN,607,"He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll
probably expect you to be
understanding--might surprise him if
you're not."
608,WOODWARD,608,You want me to be the bastard.
609,BERNSTEIN,609,"And I'll just shitkick in my usual
way."
610,WOODWARD,610,To see Mr. Sloan.
611,MRS. SLOAN,611,He's out.
612,MRS. SLOAN,612,"You're those two from the Post, aren't
you."
613,MRS. SLOAN,613,I'll tell him.
614,BERNSTEIN,614,"This must be a difficult time for
the both of you."
615,MRS. SLOAN,615,This is an honest house.
616,WOODWARD,616,"That's why we wanted to see your
husband."
617,MRS. SLOAN,617,That decision is up to him.
618,BERNSTEIN,618,Maybe you could put in a good word.
619,WOODWARD,619,"We've got another appointment tonight
in this area--we'll just stop back
later, all right?"
620,MRS. SLOAN,620,It's a free country--
621,MRS. SLOAN,621,--in theory.
622,MRS. SLOAN,622,Be careful--
623,MRS. SLOAN,623,--you can destroy lives.
624,WOODWARD,624,Think Sloan's back?
625,WOODWARD,625,What's wrong?
626,BERNSTEIN,626,"Nothing--I just found out that Jeb
Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike
freak than I am."
627,BERNSTEIN,627,"I never like it when the other guy's
human..."
628,WOODWARD,628,Mr. Sloan?
629,SLOAN,629,My wife told me to expect you.
630,SLOAN,630,"As you know, I haven't talked to the
press."
631,BERNSTEIN,631,"We were hoping that maybe now you
could. We know why you left the
Committee. We know you're not guilty
of anything. But we know you know
who is--"
632,SLOAN,632,"--look, come in. We'll have to be
quiet--my wife's asleep."
633,SLOAN,633,"I'd like to talk to you, I really
would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't
until after the Watergate trial."
634,WOODWARD,634,"You handed out the money. Maybe
there's a legitimate explanation for
the way it was done--"
635,BERNSTEIN,635,"--then again, maybe things are even
worse than we've written--"
636,SLOAN,636,--they're worse. That's why I quit.
637,SLOAN,637,"Try and understand this. I'm a decent
Republican. I believe in Richard
Nixon. I worked in the White House
four years--so did my wife. What
happened on June 17 I don't think
the President knew anything about.
Some of his men I'm not so sure of."
638,BERNSTEIN,638,"Do you think the truth will come out
at the trial?"
639,SLOAN,639,"That's another of the things I'm not
so sure of."
640,BERNSTEIN,640,"Because people at the Committee were
told to lie to the prosecutors?"
641,SLOAN,641,"We were never told flat out ""Don't
talk."" But the message was clear."
642,BERNSTEIN,642,To cover up?
643,SLOAN,643,"Well, they sure didn't ask us to
come forward and tell the truth."
644,WOODWARD,644,"Does ""they"" mean the White House?"
645,SLOAN,645,"As opposed to the Committee? The
Committee's not an independent
operation. Everything is cleared
with the White House. I don't think
that the FBI or the prosecutors
understand that."
646,WOODWARD,646,"The report on the cash in Maurice
Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty
thousand, that's true?"
647,SLOAN,647,"No. It was closer to seven hundred
thousand."
648,WOODWARD,648,"And as treasurer, you could release
those funds?"
649,SLOAN,649,When so ordered.
650,WOODWARD,650,"We're not sure we've got all the
guys who could order you, but we
know there were five."
651,BERNSTEIN,651,"Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they're
obvious--"
652,WOODWARD,652,"--there had to be a White House
overseer--"
653,BERNSTEIN,653,--Colson.
654,SLOAN,654,"Colson's too smart to get directly
involved with something like that."
655,WOODWARD,655,Haldeman.
656,WOODWARD,656,Right?
657,SLOAN,657,I won't talk about the other two.
658,BERNSTEIN,658,"But they both worked at the White
House?"
659,SLOAN,659,I will not talk about the other two.
660,BERNSTEIN,660,Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
661,SLOAN,661,"I can't say anything, I'm sorry."
662,WOODWARD,662,"One thing I'm not completely clear
on--when you gave out the money to
Liddy, how did that work?"
663,SLOAN,663,Badly.
664,SLOAN,664,"You don't realize how close all this
came to staying undiscovered--I gave
Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave
it to Barker who took it to Miami
and deposited it."
665,BERNSTEIN,665,Right.
666,SLOAN,666,"Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand
in hundred dollar bills and gave it
back to Liddy who gave it back to me
and I put it in the office safe which
was crammed."
667,WOODWARD,667,Go on.
668,SLOAN,668,"Well, when Liddy came and asked for
money for what turned out to be the
break-in funds, I went to the safe
and gave him--out of this whole
fortune--I happened to give him the
same hundreds he gave me--banks have
to keep track of hundreds. If the
money had been in fifties, or if I'd
grabbed a different stack, there
probably wouldn't have been any
Watergate story."
669,BERNSTEIN,669,"Ordinarily, though, what was the
procedure?"
670,SLOAN,670,"Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell
over at the Justice Department and
he'd say ""go ahead, give out the
money."""
671,BERNSTEIN,671,What happens when the baby comes?
672,SLOAN,672,We're moving.
673,SLOAN,673,"I've been looking for a job but it's
been... hard. My name's been in the
papers too much. Sometimes I wonder
if reporters understand how much
pain they can inflict in just one
sentence. I'm not thinking of myself.
But my wife, my parents, it's been
very rough on them."
674,SLOAN,674,"I wish I could put down on paper
what it's like--you come to Washington
because you believe in something,
and then you get inside and you see
how things actually work and you
watch your ideals disintegrate."
675,SLOAN,675,"The people inside, the people in the
White House, they start to believe
they can suspend the rules because
they're fulfilling a mission. That
becomes the only important thing--
the mission. It's so easy to lose
perspective. We want to get out before
we lose ours altogether."
676,BERNSTEIN,676,"Look--five men controlled that slush
fund as CREEP--three of them we've
got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and
we're pretty sure of Kalmbach."
677,WOODWARD,677,"We'd like to wait til we have all
five before we print it."
678,BRADLEE,678,"This is a daily paper, we'll explain
it tomorrow."
679,BRADLEE,679,You're certain on Mitchell?
680,WOODWARD,680,"He approved the payments to Liddy
while he was still Attorney General--"
681,ROSENFELD,681,--you got more than one source?--
682,BERNSTEIN,682,--yes--
683,SIMONS,683,--has any of them got an ax?--
684,ROSENFELD,684,"--political, personal, sexual,
anything at all against Mitchell?--"
685,WOODWARD,685,--no--
686,SIMONS,686,--can we use their names?--
687,BERNSTEIN,687,--no--
688,BRADLEE,688,"--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna
go on the record on this story--"
689,ROSENFELD,689,--who you got?--
690,WOODWARD,690,"--well, Sloan--"
691,BERNSTEIN,691,--and we got a guy in Justice--
692,BRADLEE,692,--Deep Throat?--
693,WOODWARD,693,--I saw him. He verifies.
694,BRADLEE,694,OK.
695,BRADLEE,695,"You're about to write a story that
says that the former Attorney General--
the man who represented law in America--
is a crook."
696,BRADLEE,696,"Just be right, huh?"
697,BRADLEE,697,Leave plenty of room for his denial.
698,OPERATOR'S VOICE (V.O.),698,"Essex House, can I help you?"
699,BERNSTEIN,699,"John Mitchell, please."
700,JOHN MITCHELL'S VOICE (V.O.),700,Yes?
701,BERNSTEIN,701,"Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the
Washington Post, and I'm sorry to
bother you but we're running a story
in tomorrow's paper that we thought
you should have a chance to comment
on."
702,MITCHELL (V.O.),702,What does it say?
703,BERNSTEIN,703,"John N. Mitchell, while serving as
US Attorney General, personally
controlled a secret cash fund that--"
704,MITCHELL (V.O.),704,--jeeeeeeesus--
705,BERNSTEIN,705,"--fund that was used to gather
information against the Democrats--"
706,MITCHELL (V.O.),706,--jeeeeeeesus--
707,BERNSTEIN,707,"--according to sources involved in
the Watergate investigation. Beginning
in the spring of 1971--"
708,MITCHELL (V.O.),708,--jeeeeeeesus--
709,BERNSTEIN,709,"--almost a year before he left the
Justice Department--"
710,MITCHELL (V.O.),710,--jeeeeeeeeesus--
711,BERNSTEIN,711,"--to become President Nixon's campaign
manager on March 1, Mitchell
personally approved withdrawals from
the fund--"
712,MITCHELL (V.O.),712,"--all that crap, you're putting it
in the paper? It's all been denied.
You tell your publisher--tell Katie
Graham she's gonna get her tit caught
in a big fat wringer if that's
published. Good Christ! That's the
most sickening thing I ever heard."
713,BERNSTEIN,713,"Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--"
714,MITCHELL (V.O.),714,--what time is it?
715,BERNSTEIN,715,11:30.
716,MITCHELL (V.O.),716,Morning or night?
717,BERNSTEIN,717,Night.
718,MITCHELL (V.O.),718,Oh.
719,BRADLEE,719,"He really made that remark about
Mrs. Graham?"
720,BRADLEE,720,"This is a family newspaper--cut the
words ""her tit"" and run it."
721,BRADLEE,721,"Once when I was reporting, Lyndon
Johnson's top guy gave me the word
they were looking for a successor to
J. Edgar Hoover. I wrote it and the
day it appeared Johnson called a
press conference and appointed Hoover
head of the FBI for life... And when
he was done, he turned to his top
guy and the President said, ""Call
Ben Bradlee and tell him fuck you."""
722,BRADLEE,722,"I took a lot of static for that--
everyone said, ""You did it, Bradlee,
you screwed up--you stuck us with
Hoover forever--"""
723,BRADLEE,723,--I screwed up but I wasn't wrong.
724,BRADLEE,724,"You guys haven't been wrong yet, is
that why you're scared shitless?"
725,BRADLEE,725,You should be...
726,SENATOR,726,"Although I am a Republican, I would
like to state in a pure bipartisan
spirit that I feel only sadness that
a once fine journal of record like
the Post would have become merely
the hysterical spokesman for the
equally hysterical left wing of the
Democratic Party--"
727,CREEP P.R. MAN,727,"--hearsay, innuendo, and character
assassination. I can only conclude
that the so-called sources of the
Washington Post are a fountain of
misinformation--"
728,WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN,728,"--the White House has long since
stopped being surprised at this type
of reporting by certain elements of
the Eastern liberal press--"
729,SIMONS,729,Same kind of crap--
730,BRADLEE,730,"--all non-denial denials--we're dirty
guys and they doubt we were ever
virgins but they don't say the story
is inaccurate."
731,BERNSTEIN,731,What's a real denial?
732,BRADLEE,732,"If they ever start calling us goddamn
liars--"
733,BRADLEE,733,"--it's time to start circling the
wagons."
734,FIRST UNION GUY,734,"You think they know what they're
doing on the fifth floor?"
735,SECOND UNION GUY,735,"I got eight kids to support--they
better."
736,WOODWARD,736,"What do you think Mrs. Graham wants
to see me for?"
737,SIMONS,737,"Maybe to fire you--since you two
started on this story, the Post stock
has dropped, what, 50 percent?"
738,SIMONS,738,"And the word is some Nixon people
are challenging her TV licenses. I'm
not saying she's going on relief,
but I don't think it's unreasonable
for her to want to meet you."
739,WOODWARD,739,"You think she wants us to ease up on
the story?"
740,SIMONS,740,"I don't know, but I don't think that's
unreasonable either, do you?"
741,MRS. GRAHAM,741,"I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--"
742,WOODWARD,742,--I'm Woodward.
743,MRS. GRAHAM,743,"You know, the paper was my father's
and my husband's when they were alive
and I was thinking back a year or
two ago when Ben called me and said
he wanted to publish the Pentagon
Papers the next day. The Times had
already been stopped from publishing
anymore of them and all my legal
counsel said ""don't, don't"" and I
was frightened but I knew if I said
no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor.
So we published, and that night,
after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I
woke up in the darkness and I thought,
""Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this
newspaper?"""
744,MRS. GRAHAM,744,"I woke up again last night with that
same question."
745,MRS. GRAHAM,745,Are we right on this story?
746,WOODWARD,746,I think so.
747,MRS. GRAHAM,747,Are you sure?
748,WOODWARD,748,No.
749,MRS. GRAHAM,749,"When will you be, do you think?--
when are we going to know it all?"
750,WOODWARD,750,It may never come out.
751,MRS. GRAHAM,751,Never? Please don't tell me never.
752,MRS. GRAHAM,752,"Ben says you've found some wonderful
sources."
753,WOODWARD,753,"Some Justice Department lawyers and
an FBI man, and some people from the
Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am."
754,MRS. GRAHAM,754,And the underground garage one.
755,MRS. GRAHAM,755,Would I know him?
756,WOODWARD,756,I couldn't say.
757,MRS. GRAHAM,757,But it's possible.
758,WOODWARD,758,It is.
759,MRS. GRAHAM,759,You've never told anyone who he is?
760,MRS. GRAHAM,760,"But you'd have to tell me if I asked
you."
761,MRS. GRAHAM,761,Tell me.
762,WOODWARD,762,"I would, if you really ever wanted
to know."
763,MRS. GRAHAM,763,I really want to know.
764,MRS. GRAHAM,764,"I wasn't serious. I have plenty of
burdens to carry around, I don't
need another."
765,MRS. GRAHAM,765,"We're going to need lots of good
luck, aren't we?"
766,WOODWARD,766,Nobody ever had too much.
767,MRS. GRAHAM,767,Do better.
768,WOODWARD,768,What?
769,BRADLEE,769,"I thought you guys were supposed to
be working on this story--"
770,BRADLEE,770,--you think I like being aced out?
771,BERNSTEIN,771,--what?--
772,WOODWARD,772,"--The L.A. Times has a huge interview
with Baldwin--"
773,BERNSTEIN,773,--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--
774,BERNSTEIN,774,--he say anything we don't know?--
775,WOODWARD,775,"--just that a lot of reports were
sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name
who, not here anyway--"
776,BRADLEE,776,"--it would have been nice to have
had this, I sure would have liked to
have had this--"
777,BERNSTEIN,777,--there's nothing new in it--
778,BRADLEE,778,"--it makes the break-in real--it's a
major goddamn story--"
779,BRADLEE,779,"--I'm not going to kick ass over
this, but I'd like you to know I
hate getting beat, I just hate it--
don't forget that I hate it--"
780,BERNSTEIN,780,Goddamnit--
781,WOODWARD,781,--shit--
782,BERNSTEIN,782,--we gotta top the Times--
783,WOODWARD,783,"--I know, I know--"
784,BERNSTEIN,784,"--if we could name the guys got the
reports, we'd be ahead again--"
785,WOODWARD,785,"--shit, who do we know?--"
786,BERNSTEIN,786,--I know a lawyer at Justice--
787,WOODWARD,787,--has he got an ax?--
788,BERNSTEIN,788,"--almost every source we've used has
been Republican, this guy's a card-
carrying Democrat."
789,WOODWARD,789,Then he's got an ax.
790,WOODWARD,790,Call him anyway.
791,FIRST UNION GUY,791,Who is this Woodstein?
792,FIRST UNION GUY,792,Two stories on the front page.
793,SECOND UNION GUY,793,"If he can't pick a winner at Pimlico,
to hell with him."
794,BERNSTEIN,794,"--I want you to shut up and listen
to me--"
795,WOODWARD,795,--I haven't said anything--
796,BERNSTEIN,796,"--for the first time I'm beginning
to feel like a fucking reporter--
Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called
me up with a tip--"
797,BERNSTEIN,797,"--someone named Donald Segretti
contacted a bunch of lawyers and
asked them if they'd like to go to
work with him screwing up the
Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like
that. The FBI knows about Segretti--
Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone
calls to him--they interrogated him,
but on account of Segretti wasn't
involved with the break-in, they
didn't follow through. But Segretti
did a lot of traveling--he called
these lawyers from different places,
and he told them the Republicans
knew what he was doing."
798,WOODWARD,798,"How high up, which Republicans?"
799,BERNSTEIN,799,"That's what we've got to find out,
but Segretti went to Southern Cal.
and so did a bunch of Nixon men--"
800,WOODWARD,800,"--Haldeman I know, who else?"
801,BERNSTEIN,801,"Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments
chief--he knew Segretti in school.
Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the
first time any of this starts to
make sense. What were the three
theories?"
802,WOODWARD,802,"The burglary was done by Cubans or
Democrats or Republicans."
803,BERNSTEIN,803,"Now the reason no one believed the
Republicans is because there wasn't
any reason, they were so far ahead.
But Segretti was talking to these
other lawyers a year before the break-
in."
804,WOODWARD,804,"So maybe Watergate wasn't really
about Watergate--maybe that was just
a piece--"
805,BERNSTEIN,805,"--because a year before, the
Republicans weren't ahead, not in
the polls, Muskie was running ahead
of Nixon then. Before he self-
destructed."
806,WOODWARD,806,If he self-destructed.
807,WOODWARD,807,"Segretti criss-crossed the country
over ten times in six months--and
never stayed anyplace over a night
or two."
808,WOODWARD,808,"Switch to another station, huh? You're
driving me crazy with that."
809,BERNSTEIN,809,"Segovia begged me for me secret but
I said, ""No, Andres, you'll have to
try and make it without me."""
810,WOODWARD,810,"California, Illinois, Florida, New
Hampshire--all the major Democratic
primary states."
811,WOODWARD,811,"Why does everything you play sound
the same?"
812,BERNSTEIN,812,--'cause I only know four chords--
813,BERNSTEIN (V.O.),813,Donald Segretti?
814,SEGRETTI,814,That's right.
815,BERNSTEIN,815,I'm Carl Bernstein.
816,BERNSTEIN,816,"My paper sent me out to see if I
couldn't persuade you to go on the
record."
817,SEGRETTI,817,You can't.
818,BERNSTEIN,818,Mind if I try?
819,BERNSTEIN,819,"According to what we've been able to
verify, you've been busy."
820,SEGRETTI,820,I've got a lot of energy.
821,BERNSTEIN,821,"Listen--we know you're involved in
this--we're going to get the story,
why not help?"
822,SEGRETTI,822,"They never told me anything except
my own role--I had to find out the
rest in the papers."
823,BERNSTEIN,823,"By ""they"" you mean...?"
824,BERNSTEIN,824,"By ""they"" you mean the White House,
don't you?"
825,BERNSTEIN,825,"Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin--
he works for the White House."
826,SEGRETTI,826,I know where Dwight works.
827,BERNSTEIN,827,When did he hire you?
828,BERNSTEIN,828,"Do you feel much about the things
you did?"
829,SEGRETTI,829,I didn't do anything wrong.
830,BERNSTEIN,830,Tell that to Muskie.
831,SEGRETTI,831,"Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff."
832,BERNSTEIN,832,"During the Florida primary, you wrote
a letter on Muskie stationery saying
Scoop Jackson had a bastard child.
You wrote another that said Hubert
Humphrey was out with call girls."
833,SEGRETTI,833,"Sometimes it got up to a quarter
maybe--"
834,SEGRETTI,834,--off the record.
835,BERNSTEIN,835,"You wrote the Canuck letter--the one
where you claimed Muskie slurred the
Canadians."
836,SEGRETTI,836,I didn't.
837,BERNSTEIN,837,But you know who did.
838,SEGRETTI,838,"When you guys print it in the paper,
then I'll know."
839,SEGRETTI,839,"I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go
to jail, and be disbarred, and what
did I do that was so awful?"
840,SEGRETTI,840,"None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't
go looking for the job."
841,BERNSTEIN,841,Chapin did contact you then?
842,SEGRETTI,842,Sure--off the record.
843,BERNSTEIN,843,On the orders of Haldeman?
844,SEGRETTI,844,"I don't know anything about Haldeman,
except, Dwight's frightened of him--
everybody's frightened of him--Christ,
I wish I'd never gotten messed around
with this--all I wanna do is sit in
the sun; sit, swim, see some girls."
845,BERNSTEIN,845,"It gets interesting if it was
Haldeman, because our word is that
when Chapin says something, he's
gotten the OK from Haldeman, and
when Haldeman says something, he's
gotten the OK from the President."
846,SEGRETTI,846,Can't help you.
847,BERNSTEIN,847,"At USC, you had a word the this--
screwing up the opposition you all
did it at college and called it
ratfucking."
848,BERNSTEIN,848,"Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out
to be the biggest ratfucker of them
all?"
849,SEGRETTI,849,"What would you have done if you were
just getting out of the Army, if
you'd been away from the real world
for four years, if you weren't sure
what kind of law you wanted to
practice, and then one day you got a
call from an old friend asking you
to go to work for the President of
the United States...?"
850,BERNSTEIN,850,What would you have done?
851,WOODWARD,851,"You asking would I have been one of
the President's men?"
852,WOODWARD,852,I would have been.
853,DEEP THROAT,853,My turn to keep you waiting.
854,DEEP THROAT,854,What's the topic for tonight?
855,WOODWARD,855,Ratfucking.
856,DEEP THROAT,856,"In my day, it was simply called the
double cross. I believe the CIA refers
to it as Mindfuck. In our context,
it simply means infiltration of the
Democrats."
857,WOODWARD,857,"I know what it means--Segretti
wouldn't go on the record, but if he
would, we know he'd implicate Chapin.
And that would put us inside the
White House."
858,DEEP THROAT,858,"Yes, the little ratfuckers are now
running our government."
859,WOODWARD,859,Who?--be specific. How high up?
860,DEEP THROAT,860,"You'll have to find that out, won't
you."
861,WOODWARD,861,"The slush fund at CREEP financed the
ratfucking, we've almost got that
nailed down, so--"
862,WOODWARD,862,What?
863,DEEP THROAT,863,Did you change cabs?
864,DEEP THROAT,864,"It didn't work, something moved there--"
865,WOODWARD,865,Who are you?
866,WOODWARD,866,Here.
867,WOODWARD,867,"Forget your troubles and just be
happy."
868,DEEP THROAT,868,"I hope you noticed how coolly I
behaved under the threat of discovery."
869,WOODWARD,869,"Do Justice and the FBI know what we
know, and why the hell haven't they
done anything about it?"
870,DEEP THROAT,870,"They know, but they focused on the
burglary--if it didn't deal with the
break-in, they didn't pursue it."
871,WOODWARD,871,"Why didn't they?--who told them not
to?"
872,DEEP THROAT,872,"Someone with authority I'd imagine,
wouldn't you?"
873,DEEP THROAT,873,"Don't you know what you're onto?
Come on."
874,WOODWARD,874,Mitchell knew then.
875,DEEP THROAT,875,"Of course--my God, you think something
this big just happens? The break-in
and the cover up, of course Mitchell
knew, but no more than Ehrlichman."
876,WOODWARD,876,Haldeman too?
877,DEEP THROAT,877,"You get nothing from me about
Haldeman?"
878,WOODWARD,878,"Why did they do all this for
Chrissakes?--what were they after?"
879,DEEP THROAT,879,"Total manipulation. I suppose you
could say they wanted to subvert the
Constitution, but they don't think
along philosophical lines."
880,WOODWARD,880,Talk about Segretti--
881,DEEP THROAT,881,"--don't concentrate on Segretti or
you'll miss the overall scheme too."
882,WOODWARD,882,There were more then.
883,DEEP THROAT,883,"Follow every lead--every lead goes
somewhere--"
884,WOODWARD,884,"--the Canuck letter--was that a White
House operation--"
885,DEEP THROAT,885,"--don't you miss the grand scheme
too."
886,WOODWARD,886,How grand?
887,DEEP THROAT,887,"Nationwide--my God, they were
frightened of Muskie and look who
got destroyed--they wanted to run
against McGovern, and look who they're
running against. They bugged, they
followed people, false press leaks,
fake letters, they canceled Democratic
campaign rallies, they investigated
Democratic private lives, they planted
spies, stole documents, on and on--
don't tell me you think this was all
the work of little Don Segretti."
888,WOODWARD,888,And Justice and FBI know all this?
889,DEEP THROAT,889,"Yes, yes, everything. There were
over fifty people employed by the
White House and CREEP to ratfuck--
some of what they did is beyond
belief."
890,WOODWARD,890,"Fifty ratfuckers directed by the
White House to destroy the Democrats?"
891,"DEEP THROAT
DEEP THROAT",891,I was being cautious.
892,"DEEP THROAT
DEEP THROAT",892,You can safely say more then fifty...
893,BERGER,893,"Do you guys know about the Canuck
letter?"
894,BERNSTEIN,894,Um-hmm.
895,BERNSTEIN,895,Why?
896,BERGER,896,"I just wanted to be sure you knew
who wrote it."
897,BERNSTEIN,897,Tell him what you just told me.
898,BERGER,898,"Just than Ken Clawsen--he used to be
a reporter here before he went to
work for Nixon--I had him over for a
drink a few weeks ago and he told me
he wrote the Canuck letter."
899,BERGER,899,"You did want to know, didn't you?"
900,BERNSTEIN,900,"You think we're being set up?--Christ,
Deep Throat tells you last night
that the letter came from inside the
White House and up traipses Marilyn
naming names."
901,WOODWARD,901,"It makes a crazy kind of sense--
remember that initiation rite they
have at the White House? Each new
member of the President's staff has
to prove his guts by getting an enemy
of Nixon."
902,BERNSTEIN,902,"You think this was Clawsen's
initiation?"
903,WOODWARD,903,"Could have won him a fraternity paddle
with a White House seal."
904,WOODWARD,904,God knows it worked.
905,WOODWARD (V.O.),905,"You claiming it was all a
misunderstanding, Ken?"
906,CLAWSEN (V.O.),906,"Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it
totally wrong--"
907,WOODWARD,907,"She's an awfully good reporter--I
can't remember her getting too much
wrong before, can you?"
908,CLAWSEN (V.O.),908,"That's a bullshit question, that's a
question straight out of Wichita,
Kansas."
909,WOODWARD,909,"Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing:
where did your talk with Berger
happen?"
910,CLAWSEN (V.O.),910,Where?
911,CLAWSEN (V.O.),911,"What do you mean, where?"
912,WOODWARD,912,"Well, was it in a bar, her apartment,
some restaurant--"
913,CLAWSEN (V.O.),913,"--I've completely forgotten where it
was, except I know it wasn't her
apartment."
914,WOODWARD,914,"Non denial-denial, Marilyn--"
915,CLAWSEN (V.O.),915,"For Chissakes, don't tell them I
came to your place."
916,BERGER,916,I already told them.
917,CLAWSEN (V.O.),917,"Oh, that's terrific, that's just so
terrific, I'm thrilled you did that."
918,BERGER,918,I have a clear conscience.
919,CLAWSEN (V.O.),919,"Marilyn, I have a wife and a family
and a cat and a dog."
920,BRADLEE,920,I got Clawsen on hold--
921,WOODWARD,921,"--his dialing finger must be falling
off--"
922,BRADLEE,922,--what do you think?--
923,WOODWARD,923,"--he went to her apartment and he
told her--"
924,BERNSTEIN,924,"--if he did it or just said he did
it, God knows."
925,BRADLEE,925,"I could care less about where it
happened; what happened is what
counts."
926,BRADLEE,926,Put him on.
927,BRADLEE,927,"Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut
and they were having a crisis, what's
up, kid?"
928,BRADLEE,928,"Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled."
929,BRADLEE,929,"A wife and a family and a cat and a
dog, right, Ken."
930,BRADLEE,930,"Ken, I would never print that you
were in Marilyn's apartment at night--
unless, of course, you force me to."
931,BRADLEE,931,"It's like they taught us at Harvard:
few things are as gratifying to the
soul as having another man's nuts in
a vise..."
932,WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN,932,"The story is based entirely on hearsay
and--"
933,CREEP P.R. MAN,933,"--we at the Committee are continually
amazed at the creativity shown by
the Washington Post--"
934,WESTERN SENATOR,934,"--although I am a Republican, I would
like to state in a pure bipartisan
spirit that I am happy that this
latest onslaught against the
intelligence of the American people
will be wrapping fish tomorrow. I
offer my condolences to the fish..."
935,ROSENFELD,935,Speak.
936,BERNSTEIN,936,We've just been talking to Young--
937,SIMONS,937,--which Young?
938,WOODWARD,938,"Larry Young, a California lawyer--"
939,BERNSTEIN,939,"--he was going to go into law practice
with Segretti."
940,ROSENFELD,940,And?--
941,WOODWARD,941,--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
942,SIMONS,942,"--well and good, but when will he
say it on the record."
943,WOODWARD,943,He just did.
944,BERNSTEIN,944,He'll give us a sworn statement.
945,WOODWARD,945,We're inside the White House now.
946,BRADLEE,946,"Look, I wanted to talk because things
are getting really hairy and there's
a couple of things we've got to be
careful of because--"
947,BRADLEE,947,"--either of you want a drink or should
I order?--"
948,BRADLEE,948,--because--
949,BRADLEE,949,"--because our cocks are on the
chopping block and you've got to be
sure that you're not just dealing
with people who hate Richard Nixon
and want to get him through us. You
see, I don't give a shit who's
President--I really don't, it's an
adversary situation between them and
us and it's always gonna be. I never
had a closer friend than Jack Kennedy
and once I printed something that
pissed him off and for seven months
I didn't exist."
950,MAN,950,"You none of you know who I am, do
you?"
951,MAN,951,"You screw me up good, you don't even
know what I look like."
952,BRADLEE,952,"OK, you've had your preamble; who
the hell are you?"
953,MAN,953,"Glenn Sedam--you wrote about me last
week, you said I was one of the guys
at the Committee who was sent reports.
You were wrong."
954,BERNSTEIN,954,Baldwin told the FBI it was you.
955,SEDAM,955,"Baldwin told the FBI it was someone
whose first name sounded like a last
name. They showed him a list and he
picked me but it wasn't me, it was
Gordon Liddy."
956,SEDAM,956,"My phone hasn't stopped ringing, my
wife's hysterical, my kids think I'm
mixed up with the burglary, my friends
don't like me around all of a sudden."
957,SEDAM,957,"You fucked around my life, you two."
958,SEDAM,958,I just wanted to say thanks.
959,BRADLEE,959,"That didn't sound to me like a non-
denial denial; could you have been
wrong?"
960,BRADLEE,960,You had a good source?
961,BRADLEE,961,Did he have an ax?
962,BRADLEE,962,"All right, you made a mistake maybe,
we all have, just don't make another.
And watch your personal lives, who
you hang around with. Someone once
said the price of democracy is a
bloodletting every ten years."
963,BRADLEE,963,Make sure it isn't our blood...
964,SLOAN,964,I really can't talk now--
965,BERNSTEIN,965,--this'll only take one second--
966,SLOAN,966,"--my wife just had the baby, my in-
laws are arriving, I'm trying to get
the house in some kind of shape."
967,WOODWARD,967,A boy or a girl?
968,SLOAN,968,A girl. Melissa.
969,WOODWARD,969,Where does this go?
970,WOODWARD,970,"--That cash fund that financed the
sabotaging of the Democrats--five
guys had control--"
971,BERNSTEIN,971,"--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--"
972,WOODWARD,972,"--we're working on the last guy now
and we're going all the way--that
fifth man was Haldeman."
973,SLOAN,973,--I'm not your source on that--
974,BERNSTEIN,974,"--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone
from the White House had to be
involved--"
975,WOODWARD,975,"--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson
or the President."
976,SLOAN,976,"No, none of those."
977,BERNSTEIN,977,"--that leaves Haldeman, period."
978,SLOAN,978,I'm not your source on that.
979,WOODWARD,979,"--look, when the Watergate grand
jury questioned you, did you name
names?"
980,SLOAN,980,Of course--everything they asked--
981,BERNSTEIN,981,"--if we wrote a story that said
Haldeman controlled the fund?--"
982,SLOAN,982,"--let me put it this way: I'd have
no problem if you did."
983,WOODWARD'S VOICE (V.O.),983,Hey?
984,WOODWARD,984,I think that's him.
985,BERNSTEIN,985,Who?
986,WOODWARD,986,Haldeman.
987,BERNSTEIN,987,Nah.
988,BERNSTEIN,988,Maybe.
989,WOODWARD,989,"What if I went up and introduced
myself--think he'd slug me?"
990,BERNSTEIN,990,"Well, we are trying to ruin his life."
991,WOODWARD,991,"It's nothing personal, though."
992,BERNSTEIN,992,What's the matter?
993,WOODWARD,993,"Same as Magruder, I don't like it
when they turn out to be human."
994,BERNSTEIN,994,"I wish we were investigating Attila
the Hun."
995,WOODWARD,995,Maybe we are...
996,PUDGY MAN,996,"--Goddamnit, I'm not gonna say it
again--you get nothing about Haldeman
outta me--"
997,WOODWARD,997,"--we don't need it now, because
tomorrow's story is about the FBI--"
998,BERNSTEIN,998,"--about how all you supposed experts
really blew the whole investigation--"
999,FBI GUY,999,--we didn't miss so much--
1000,WOODWARD,1000,"--you never knew Haldeman had control
of the slush fund--"
1001,FBI GUY,1001,--it's all in our files--
1002,BERNSTEIN,1002,--not about Haldeman--
1003,FBI GUY,1003,"--yeah, Haldeman, John Haldeman."
1004,BERNSTEIN,1004,--Jesus--
1005,WOODWARD,1005,"--he said John Haldeman, not Bob
Haldeman--"
1006,BRADLEE,1006,"--I don't know, I don't know, it
feels thin--"
1007,SIMONS,1007,"--Christ, I wish I knew if we should
print this--"
1008,ROSENFELD,1008,"--listen, we didn't make them do
these things--once they did, it's
our job to report it--"
1009,SIMONS,1009,--go over your sources again--
1010,WOODWARD,1010,"--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he
answered everything they asked him--
that means there's a record somewhere--"
1011,BERNSTEIN,1011,"--and the FBI confirms--what more do
you need?--"
1012,ROSENFELD,1012,"--listen, I love this country, you
think I want to bring it down?--I'm
not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--"
1013,SIMONS,1013,"--Harry, weren't you just arguing
the opposite way?--"
1014,ROSENFELD,1014,--maybe I'm tense--
1015,BRADLEE,1015,"--well shit, we oughtta be tense--
we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman
who only happens to be the second
most important man in America of
conducting a criminal conspiracy
from inside the White House--"
1016,BRADLEE,1016,--it would be nice if we were right--
1017,SIMONS,1017,--you double-checked both sources?--
1018,BRADLEE,1018,"--Bernstein, are you sure on this
story?"
1019,BERNSTEIN,1019,Absolutely--
1020,BRADLEE,1020,--what about you?--
1021,WOODWARD,1021,--I'm sure--
1022,BRADLEE,1022,"--I'm not sure, it still feels thin--"
1023,SIMONS,1023,--get another source.
1024,BERNSTEIN,1024,"How many fucking sources they think
we got?--"
1025,WOODWARD,1025,"--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never
thought he was scared of anyone, but
he's scared of Haldeman."
1026,BERNSTEIN,1026,"I know a guy in the Justice Department
who was around the Grand Jury."
1027,WOODWARD,1027,--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
1028,LAWYER'S VOICE (O.S.),1028,"...You shouldn't ever call me like
this, Carl..."
1029,BERNSTEIN,1029,"Will you confirm that Haldeman was
mentioned by Sloan to the Grand Jury?"
1030,LAWYER'S VOICE (O.S.),1030,"...I won't say anything about
Haldeman... not ever..."
1031,BERNSTEIN,1031,"All right--listen--it's against the
law if you talk about the Grand Jury,
right? But you don't have to say a
thing--I'll count to ten--if the
story's wrong, hang up before I get
there--if it's OK stay on the line
till after, got it?"
1032,LAWYER (O.S.),1032,"Hang up, right?"
1033,BERNSTEIN,1033,"Right, right--OK, counting: one, two--"
1034,BERNSTEIN,1034,"--three, four, five, six--"
1035,BERNSTEIN,1035,"--seven, eight--"
1036,BERNSTEIN,1036,"--nine, ten, thank you."
1037,LAWYER (O.S.),1037,"You've got it straight now? Everything
OK?"
1038,BERNSTEIN,1038,Yeah!
1039,WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN,1039,"On the record let me say just this:
the story is totally untrue. On
background, I'd like to add that Bob
Haldeman is one of the greatest public
servants this country has ever had
and the story is a goddamned lie."
1040,BRADLEE,1040,Woodstein!
1041,SCHORR,1041,"Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment
on your testimony before the Grand
Jury."
1042,SLOAN,1042,My lawyer says--
1043,SLOAN'S LAWYER,1043,"--the answer is an unequivocal no.
Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr.
Haldeman in that testimony at all."
1044,FBI MAN,1044,"--I'll deny everything--everything--
I never talked to you about Haldeman--
I never talked to you about anything--
I'm not talking to you now--"
1045,BERNSTEIN,1045,--what went wrong?--
1046,WOODWARD,1046,--for Chrissakes just tell that--
1047,PUDGY FBI MAN,1047,--fuck you fuck you fuck you--
1048,BERNSTEIN,1048,Woodward?
1049,WOODWARD,1049,Hmm?
1050,BERNSTEIN,1050,"What was the mistake? Do you think
it's been rigged, all along the way,
leading us on so they could slip it
to us when it mattered? They couldn't
have set us up better; after all
these months our credibility's gone,
you know what that means?"
1051,WOODWARD,1051,Only everything...
1052,SIMONS,1052,More denunciations?
1053,ROSENFELD,1053,"One Senator just gave a speech
slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes."
1054,SIMONS,1054,What's this?
1055,BRADLEE,1055,My non-denial denial.
1056,ROSENFELD,1056,We're not printing a retraction?
1057,BRADLEE,1057,"Fuck it, let's stand by the boys."
1058,WOODWARD,1058,Hello?
1059,BERNSTEIN'S VOICE (O.S.),1059,What'd you find?
1060,WOODWARD,1060,"Jesus Christ, what time is it?"
1061,BERNSTEIN,1061,You overslept?
1062,WOODWARD,1062,Goddamnit!--
1063,DEEP THROAT,1063,"--you were doing so well and then
you got stupid, you went too fast--
Christ, what a royal screw up--"
1064,WOODWARD,1064,"--I know, I know, the pressure's off
the White House and it's all back on
the Post--"
1065,DEEP THROAT,1065,"--you've done worse than let Haldeman
slip away, you've got people feeling
sorry for him--I didn't think that
was possible. A conspiracy like this--
the rope has to tighten slowly around
everyone's neck. You build from the
outer edges and you go step by step.
If you shoot too high and miss, then
everybody feels more secure. You've
put the investigation back months."
1066,WOODWARD,1066,"We know that--and if we were wrong,
we're resigning--were we wrong?"
1067,DEEP THROAT,1067,"You'll have to find that out, won't
you?--"
1068,WOODWARD,1068,"--I'm tired of your chickenshit games--
I don't want hints, I want what you
know!"
1069,DEEP THROAT,1069,"It was a Haldeman operation--the
whole business--he ran the money,
but he was insulated, you'll have to
find out how--"
1070,DEEP THROAT,1070,--wait--
1071,DEEP THROAT,1071,--there's more...
1072,WOODWARD,1072,"We gotta go see Bradlee--I'll fill
you in in the car."
1073,BRADLEE,1073,"You couldn't have told me over the
phone?"
1074,WOODWARD,1074,"We can't trust the phones, not
anymore. Deep Throat says so."
1075,BRADLEE,1075,We can't talk inside either?
1076,WOODWARD,1076,Electronic surveillance.
1077,BERNSTEIN,1077,"I finally got through to Sloan--it
was all a misunderstanding that we
had: he would have told the Grand
Jury about Haldeman, he was ready
to, only nobody on the Grand Jury
asked him the goddamn question."
1078,WOODWARD,1078,"So I guess you could say that we
screwed up, but we weren't wrong."
1079,BRADLEE,1079,Anything else from Mr. Throat?
1080,WOODWARD,1080,"Mitchell started the cover-up early,
everyone is involved in the cover-
up, all the way to the top. The whole
U.S. intelligence community is mixed
in with the covert activities. The
extent of it is incredible."
1081,WOODWARD,1081,"And people's lives are in danger,
maybe including ours."
1082,BRADLEE,1082,"He's wrong on that last, we're not
in the least danger, because nobody
gives a shit--what was that Gallup
Poll result? Half the country's never
even heard the word Watergate."
1083,BRADLEE,1083,"Look, you're both probably a little
tired, right?"
1084,BRADLEE,1084,"You should be, you've been under a
lot of pressure. So go home, have a
nice hot bath, rest up fifteen minutes
if you want before you get your asses
back in gear--"
1085,BRADLEE,1085,"--because we're under a lot of
pressure, too, and you put us there--
not that I want it to worry you--
nothing's riding on you except the
First Amendment of the Constitution
plus the freedom of the press plus
the reputation of a hundred-year-old
paper plus the jobs of the two
thousand people who work there--"
1086,BRADLEE,1086,"--but none of that counts as much as
this: you fuck up again, I'm gonna
lose my temper."
1087,BRADLEE,1087,"I promise you, you don't want me to
lose my temper."
1088,BRADLEE,1088,"Move-move-move--what have you done
for me tomorrow...?"
1089,WESTERN SENATOR (O.S.),1089,"Although I'm a Republican, I would
like to state in a pure bipartisan
spirit tht the greatest political
scandal of this campaign is the brazen
manner in which, without benefit of
clergy, the Washington Post has set
up housekeeping with the McGovern
campaign..."
1090,CREEP P.R. MAN,1090,"For twenty years, the Eastern liberal
press has been trying to smear Dick
Nixon. Fortunately, the American
public is too smart to be fooled
by..."
1091,WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN,1091,"I have been informed reliably by
John Dean that no one connected with
the White House..."
1092,WESTERN SENATOR,1092,"It is only our pathetic Post that
deliberately tries to infuse the
Watergate caper with a seriousness
far beyond those shenanigans that
have been the stock trade of political
pranksters ever since..."
1093,WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN,1093,An insult to the American public--
1094,CREEP P.R. MAN,1094,"--the deplorable tactics employed by
the Washington Post--"
1095,WESTERN SENATOR,1095,"--I have been given access to evidence
in possession of the White House and
that evidence--"
1096,WESTERN SENATOR,1096,"Well, if I was wrong, I sure the
hell wasn't alone--"
1097,CREEP,1097,"--the fact remains that except for
Watergate, we ran one hell of a great
campaign..."
