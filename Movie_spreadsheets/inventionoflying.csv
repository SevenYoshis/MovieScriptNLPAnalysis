0,CHIEF CAVEMAN,0,"Me see beast today. Beast scary.
Beast danger for caveman."
1,CHIEF CAVEMAN,1,"If caveman kill beast? Caveman
safe. Caveman have food."
2,CHIEF CAVEMAN,2,Who kill beast?
3,CHIEF CAVEMAN,3,Grob kill beast. Good Grob.
4,CHIEF CAVEMAN,4,Loser want kill beast?
5,CHIEF CAVEMAN,5,Loser kill nothing!
6,CAVEMAN #1,6,Look at Loser cave! So small!
7,CAVEMAN #2,7,Loser dumb!
8,CAVEMAN #3,8,Fuck that guy!
9,CHIEF CAVEMAN,9,The beast! It dead!
10,CAVEMAN #2,10,"Hey, look at loser! He almost die!
Look he scared!"
11,CHIEF CAVEMAN,11,"Loser, what happen?"
12,LOSER CAVEMAN,12,"The Beast, it came at me. It smash
my cave."
13,LOSER CAVEMAN,13,Hold on one minute!
14,LOSER CAVEMAN,14,Loser wasn't finished.
15,LOSER CAVEMAN,15,"After beast smash cave, Loser look
at beast and say, ""not on Loser's
watch."" Loser grab rock on ground,
lift above head and smash it
down... right onto motherfucker's
head."
16,LOSER CAVEMAN,16,Loser kill beast.
17,LOSER CAVEMAN,17,"Now fuck off, Loser going back to
sleep."
18,CHIEF CAVEMAN,18,"Loser kill beast! Loser caveman
hero!"
19,NARRATOR,19,"The world's first lie. A monumental
occasion in the history of mankind."
20,NARRATOR,20,"That lowly caveman who stumbled
upon the ability to lie went on to
become chief of his village,
married dozens of cavewomen, and
passed on the lying gene to
hundreds of newborn cave-children."
21,NARRATOR,21,"Over time lying spread throughout
the world, sparking the eventual
birth of imagination itself, story-
telling, religion, and the oh-so-
important polite lie, as in, ""Oh
Patty, have you lost weight? You
look fantastic."""
22,NARRATOR,22,"The world would be a very different
place if events had gone otherwise
on that prolific, Paleolithic eve.
If not for that night, man would
have never acquired the ability to
lie to himself and to others."
23,NARRATOR,23,"A world without lying would be a
world without dreams. A world
without pretense. A world without
fiction. A world without flattery.
A world very unlike our own."
24,CHIEF CAVEMAN,24,"Loser, what happen?"
25,LOSER CAVEMAN,25,"The Beast, it came at me. It smash
my cave."
26,LOSER CAVEMAN,26,"Rock fall on beast. Loser do
nothing. I think Loser even soil
bear pants."
27,LOSER CAVEMAN,27,Loser smell bad.
28,CHIEF CAVEMAN,28,"Loser biggest loser ever! Caveman,
throw rocks at loser!"
29,JENNIFER,29,"Hi. You're early. I was just
masturbating."
30,MARK,30,"That makes me think of your vagina.
I'm Mark, how are you?"
31,JENNIFER,31,"A little frustrated at the moment.
Also equally depressed and
pessimistic about our date tonight.
I'm Jennifer."
32,MARK,32,I hope this date ends in sex.
33,JENNIFER,33,"Not me. I don't find you
attractive. Come on in."
34,JENNIFER,34,"I need to finish getting ready.
While doing that I might realize
I'm still horny and try to finish
masturbating without you hearing."
35,MARK,35,"I feel awkward and I regret being
early."
36,JENNIFER (O.S.),36,"Yeah, I'm disappointed you're early
and not really looking forward to
tonight in general, but the thought
of being alone the rest of my life
scares both my mother and I
equally."
37,MARK,37,"I have an erection now because I
assume you began masturbating once
we stopped talking."
38,MARK,38,"I'm embarrassed because I think the
restaurant I've made reservations
at might not be expensive enough or
hip enough to impress you, but it
was the best I could do because I
don't make very much money. You
see, I'm forty years old and have
no real financial assets to speak
of, I've never owned a home, and
never had a significant
relationship. My boss even told me
today that I'm most likely going to
get fired tomorrow and..."
39,JENNIFER,39,I just masturbated.
40,MARK,40,That makes me very horny.
41,JENNIFER,41,Shall we go?
42,MARK,42,Sure.
43,JENNIFER,43,After you.
44,JENNIFER,44,"I'm only doing this as a favor for
my cousin Greg. He keeps begging me
to go out on a date with you. He
says you're funny."
45,MARK,45,Greg's a good friend.
46,JENNIFER,46,Where are we eating tonight?
47,MARK,47,"A cute little place called La
Bonisera in West Hollywood."
48,JENNIFER,48,"You obviously don't have very much
money but that's not necessarily a
deal breaker."
49,MARK,49,I have very little money.
50,JENNIFER,50,"I also don't really care about a
guy who knows all the latest,
hippest restaurants."
51,MARK,51,I don't know any of them.
52,JENNIFER,52,"In fact, there are very few things
in life that I care about all that
much. The only things I have to
offer myself or anyone else are my
good looks and my affected sense of
quirkiness which artistically
inclined men interpret as
intellect."
53,JENNIFER (cont'd),53,"In fact, I think my best trait is
the fact that I've made very few
mistakes: socially, academically,
financially or romantically. I take
very few risks and therefore lead a
relatively happy and light-hearted
existence. Mostly though, I'm a
kind, sweet person with the
potential of genuinely becoming a
vital and interesting human being
the day I take the energy I expend
on hyper self-reflexivity and apply
it to actual action in the reality
of my life."
54,MARK,54,"I found that boring and started
thinking about this place's fish
tacos."
55,VALET PARKING GUY,55,I'm extremely bored.
56,JENNIFER,56,Hello.
57,JENNIFER,57,"This isn't as nice as I remember
it."
58,MARK,58,What are we going to talk about?
59,HOSTESS,59,I'm threatened by you.
60,MARK,60,"Two, please."
61,HOSTESS,61,"Of course, come with me."
62,WAITER,62,"I'm very embarrassed that I work
here. Hi."
63,MARK,63,Hello.
64,JENNIFER,64,Hello.
65,WAITER,65,"And you're pretty and that only
makes me feel worse. Can I get you
two started on some drinks?"
66,MARK,66,I'll have a Budweiser.
67,JENNIFER,67,"I'll start with your Mango
Margarita and probably have three
more drinks by the end of the
night."
68,WAITER,68,Excellent.
69,WAITER,69,She's out of your league.
70,MARK,70,Yup.
71,WOMAN,71,"All of a sudden I got EXTREMELY
angry!"
72,MARK,72,"I'm going to ask you some questions
about your life because that's what
you do, but I'll only really listen
to about half of what you're
saying."
73,MARK,73,How do you spend your days?
74,JENNIFER,74,"I get up at eight in the morning
because the noise from my alarm
clock interrupts my sleep, so I
lean over and..."
75,MARK,75,"That's a little more specific than
I expected."
76,JENNIFER,76,Well what did you want to know?
77,MARK,77,Do you have a job?
78,JENNIFER,78,Yes.
79,MARK,79,What job do you have?
80,JENNIFER,80,I have a job at an office.
81,MARK,81,What do you do?
82,JENNIFER,82,Just typing and filing and stuff.
83,MARK,83,Do you enjoy it?
84,JENNIFER,84,"No. But I enjoy the end result of
the job which is money. And the
hours are pretty good for the
amount of money I make, which I
spend on things I like, such as
clothes, hiking, drinking -- even
though I know it's bad for me."
85,JENNIFER (cont'd),85,"But I'd rather just get all the
money and not work for the results."
86,MARK,86,"Sure. Tell me more. I'm trying to
get a little insight into you."
87,JENNIFER,87,"Well you already know a lot about
me. You know I'm good looking
because... well... here I am. You
know I'm successful because you've
seen my apartment and the clothes
I'm wearing. And you know I'm happy
because I'm smiling."
88,MARK,88,Are you always happy?
89,JENNIFER,89,"Usually. Some days I stay in bed
eating and crying."
90,MARK,90,Sure.
91,WAITER,91,Here you go.
92,WAITER,92,I had a sip of this.
93,JENNIFER,93,Okay.
94,WAITER,94,"Do you guys know what you want or
do you need a moment?"
95,MARK,95,I'm ready.
96,JENNIFER,96,"I'll have a caesar salad with
chicken because I think I'm fat but
I also think I deserve something
that tastes good."
97,MARK,97,"I'll have the fish taco's because I
had them once here and it's all I
know."
98,WAITER,98,"Excellent, I'll get those both
started for you."
99,JENNIFER,99,"Sorry, one second."
100,JENNIFER,100,"It's my mother, this won't take
long. Probably checking in on our
date."
101,JENNIFER (ON PHONE),101,"Hello? Yes, I'm with him right now.
No, not very attractive. No,
doesn't make much money. He's all
right though. Seems nice. Kind of
funny. A bit fat. Funny little snub
nose. No, I won't be sleeping with
him tonight. Nope, probably not
even a kiss. Okay, you too. Bye."
102,JENNIFER,102,Sorry about that.
103,MARK,103,Don't think twice. How is your mom?
104,JENNIFER,104,She's all right.
105,MARK,105,Fantastic.
106,WAITER,106,"If I give you my number will you
call me?"
107,JENNIFER,107,No.
108,MARK,108,"Thanks for going on this date with
me. You're way, way out of my
league and I know you were just
doing it as a favor to Greg, and
that most likely I'll never hear
from you again."
109,JENNIFER,109,"I actually had a better time than I
thought I'd have, but I won't know
for sure how I feel about you until
I'm less drunk."
110,MARK,110,"Give me a call if you still like me
once you're sober."
111,JENNIFER,111,I might.
112,MARK,112,"Thanks for kissing me on the cheek,
I know you didn't have to do that
and...."
113,MARK,113,... you're very pretty. Thank you!
114,JIM,114,"Hi, I'm Jim and I'm the
spokesperson for the Coca-Cola
company. I'm here today to ask you
to continue buying coke. I'm sure
it's a drink you've been drinking
for years, and if you still enjoy
it, I'd like to remind you to buy
it again sometime soon. It's
basically just brown sugar water,
we haven't changed the ingredients
much lately, so there's nothing new
about it I can say. We changed the
can around a little bit. See, the
colors here are a little different,
and we even put a polar bear on it
for the kids. Also, coke is very
high in sugar, can lead to obesity
in children and adults who don't
sustain a healthy diet, and has a
Ph acidity level high enough to
dissolve teeth and bones over
extended periods of time. Coke also
works great at removing corrosion
from car batteries and loosening
rusted bolts. So that's it, it's
coke. Everyone knows it. It's very
famous. I'm Jim, I work for coke,
and I'm asking you to not stop
buying coke. That's all. Thanks."
115,FRANK,115,Hi Mark. How's it going?
116,MARK,116,"Not so good. Last night I went on a
date with a girl I've had a crush
on for years who will most likely
never call me again and I'm pretty
sure I'm going to get fired today.
You?"
117,FRANK,117,"I spent the whole night throwing up
pain killers because I'm too afraid
to take enough to kill myself."
118,MARK,118,See you tomorrow.
119,FRANK,119,Bye.
120,BUSINESS MAN,120,"I'm not talking to anyone on my
cell phone. I only want people to
assume I'm very busy."
121,GIRLFRIEND,121,"I woke up this morning and realized
that, not only do I not love you,
but that the thought of touching
you sickens me."
122,BOYFRIEND,122,"The more you hate me the more I
fall in love with you."
123,HONKING MAN,123,"Move it, fatty!"
124,SCREAMING MAN,124,"This isn't natural! None of this is
natural! We're all animals! This
doesn't feel right! Why am I
wearing clothes? How can you people
live like this? Where did all this
concrete come from?!"
125,WOMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT,125,"I don't want to go in there today.
I just don't. You know?"
126,TOUR GUIDE,126,"All of Lecture Films' productions
are written, filmed and edited
right here on this very lot. In
fact, this building is where
Lecture Films' talented writers
scour through the world's past
events, searching for the most
entertaining, dramatic and even
hilarious moments of world history,
which are then turned into scripts,
handed over to our world-famous
Readers, and filmed for your
viewing pleasure."
127,TOUR GUIDE,127,"If you'll just follow me over to
this monitor you'll get a sneak
peak at Lecture Film's upcoming
summer's blockbuster: ""Napoleon
1812 to 1813."""
128,NARRATOR,128,"Coming this summer from Lecture
Films Motion Picture Studios.
Written by Oscar winning
screenwriter Rob Marlowe."
129,NARRATOR (O.S.),129,"And starring Oscar winning Reader
Nathan Goldfrappe, comes the epic
sequel to last year's most talked
about film: ""Napoleon 1810 to
1811"". Prepare for the adventure."
130,NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE,130,"And so Napoleon invaded Russia with
a brute force of nearly seven
hundred thousand men behind him
armed with muskets and supported by
canon brigades."
131,NARRATOR (O.S.),131,Learn of his defeat.
132,NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE,132,"Through the devastating snow they
marched, crippled by disease and
hunger, Napoleon's men marched on."
133,NARRATOR (O.S.),133,Listen to his redemption.
134,TOURIST #1,134,"I love these films. Saves me
reading the book."
135,NARRATOR,135,"Napoleon 1812 to 1813. Coming this
summer from Lecture Films."
136,TOUR GUIDE,136,"Look everyone, there goes Mark
Bellison, one of Lecture Films very
own screenwriters!"
137,TOUR GUIDE,137,"He's one of our least successful
writers here at Lecture Films."
138,TOUR GUIDE,138,"I also hear he's most likely
getting fired today."
139,TOUR GUIDE,139,"Now let's head to editing bay where
we can watch...."
140,MARK,140,"Hi Shelley. I'm still attracted to
you today."
141,SHELLEY,141,"Hi Mark. Everyday I realize more
and more how over-qualified I am
for this position and how
incompetent you are at yours."
142,MARK,142,Any messages?
143,SHELLEY,143,"Anthony's coming by within the hour
to see if he can work up the
courage to fire you. If he can't,
he said he'll definitely do it
tomorrow."
144,MARK,144,"Nobody else called? No calls to do
with actual work?"
145,SHELLEY,145,"Well, I told everybody you were
getting fired this week and not to
expect their calls returned, so no
one left any messages."
146,MARK,146,"Next time I'd rather you took down
the messages just in case I don't
get fired."
147,SHELLEY,147,"You're almost definitely getting
fired."
148,MARK,148,"Well, it hasn't happened yet."
149,SHELLEY,149,"Okay, but everybody knows you are."
150,MARK,150,"Okay, I'll be in my office."
151,SHELLEY,151,"Okay, I'll be searching for new
jobs on Craigslist."
152,ANTHONY,152,"Wow, you look really depressed
today. That's going to make this so
much harder."
153,MARK,153,"Anthony, don't fire me."
154,ANTHONY,154,"Mark, the 1300's are boring.
Nothing interesting happened in
that century. Nobody cares about
the post-Roman, pre-enlightenment
era. The last few scripts you
turned in were depressing."
155,MARK,155,"They were about the black plague!
It's the 1300's Anthony, what else
am I going to write about!"
156,ANTHONY,156,"It's not totally your fault, Mark.
You got stuck with a bad century."
157,MARK,157,No! I can make it work!
158,ANTHONY,158,"Give it up Mark, it's not like
something new is going to have
happened in the 1300's. At Lecture
Films we're no longer interested in
searching through the less well-
known historical periods for great
events, we just want to take the
big name Reader's of the day and
have them read the historical
events that people know and love:
the holocaust, D-day, the birth of
electricity. These are the stories
people want to see, because they
know them. They find comfort in
them."
159,ANTHONY,159,"Do you think I could come back and
do this tomorrow? I just got very
nervous about firing you. I don't
do well with confrontation."
160,MARK,160,"Is there anyway you could do it
now? I'd rather not put it off."
161,ANTHONY,161,You're fired?
162,MARK,162,Damn.
163,MARK,163,"She's a really good writer, too."
164,SHELLEY,164,"I loathed almost every minute I
worked for you."
165,MARK,165,I often fantasized about you naked.
166,SHELLEY,166,What are you going to do now?
167,MARK,167,"I have no idea. But I have very
little hope for the future."
168,SHELLEY,168,"I don't have much hope for you
either, but I wish you good luck."
169,MARK,169,"Bye, Shelley."
170,SHELLEY,170,"Bye, Mark."
171,ROB,171,"So they fucking fired you, huh
dipshit? I always knew the Black
Plague would never work as a movie.
Guess the 1300's were as much of a
loser as you are."
172,MARK,172,"Please don't make me feel worse. Or
actually whatever, go ahead, I
don't think I could possibly feel
worse."
173,ROB,173,"I fucking always hated you. You're
a shitty writer assigned to a
shitty century and you're a little
man bitch. But I was always
threatened by you because I knew
there was something different about
you that I didn't understand and I
fucking hate things I don't
understand. But you will always be
a loser and I will always be more
successful than you in nearly every
way. That's just the way it is. And
Shelley calls you an ass fag behind
your back."
174,MARK,174,"Well, now I feel worse."
175,RECEPTIONIST,175,"Are you looking to abandon an
elderly person?"
176,MARK,176,"I already have. Martha Bellison.
I'm her grandson."
177,RECEPTIONIST,177,"Ooh, it's good you're here. She's
not doing well. You should say your
final goodbyes today."
178,MARK,178,You say that every time I'm here.
179,RECEPTIONIST,179,She's at the top of our death pool.
180,ELDERLY PERSON #1,180,You look like my dead son.
181,ELDERLY PERSON #3,181,"Life gets worse with each passing
minute."
182,ELDERLY PERSON #4,182,"I'm on pills that make everything
orange."
183,MARK,183,"Oh Grandma, that is so depressing.
Come on, at least stare at the
ceiling or something."
184,MARTHA,184,The television is broken.
185,MARK,185,"The television isn't broken. You
probably sat on the remote and
changed it to channel two again."
186,MARK,186,"See, you had it on the wrong
channel. It needs to be on channel
three in order for the satellite to
work."
187,MARTHA,187,"I don't understand anything you
just said and that makes me scared
and angry."
188,MARTHA (cont'd),188,"And maybe one day you'll have a
wife that you love very much too."
189,MARK,189,"Yeah, but I'm not talking about the
past, Grandma. I'm talking about
right now. And right now we're both
losers, Grandma. We're both shitty,
shitty losers. Don't you know that?"
190,MARTHA,190,"I suppose we are. But things could
be worse. We could be homeless."
191,MARK,191,"I'd rather be dead than be
homeless. That's why I need to get
out there and find a job. If I have
to be homeless, I'm going to kill
myself."
192,MARTHA,192,"Well that's sad. I love you, Mark.
Good luck finding a job!"
193,MARK,193,"I love you too, Grandma."
194,MARTHA (O.S.),194,Oops.
195,MARK,195,"I'll start looking for a job
tomorrow."
196,GREG,196,Lately I don't like Indian people.
197,GREG,197,"I don't like white people even more
though. I fucking hate white
people. I fucking hate people."
198,MARK,198,"Hey, thanks for setting me up with
your cousin by the way."
199,GREG,199,Third cousin. She's hot right?
200,MARK,200,Very.
201,GREG,201,"Way out of your league. Dunno why
you bothered."
202,MARK,202,"It felt nice to go out with someone
that pretty. Like for just one
moment I experienced what it would
be like to be the type of person
someone like that would date. It
felt good. Doesn't matter anyway. I
will always be just who I am right
now: average looking, of average
intelligence with an average
personality. Just a completely
generic human being."
203,GREG,203,"Your life is still better than
mine."
204,MARK,204,By a good margin.
205,GREG,205,"Lately I've been crying in my sleep
and waking up in a pool of urine."
206,MARK,206,"I really wish I had a better friend
than you."
207,GREG,207,"So, what are you going to do now?"
208,MARK,208,"I don't know. Guess I'll start
looking for another crappy job."
209,GREG,209,"Doubt you'll find one. Not much
need for an out-of-work writer
specializing in the Black Plague."
210,MARK,210,"I'm going to go now. You're
seriously depressing me. I really
wish I was cool enough to have a
better friend than you."
211,GREG,211,"I'm the best you're gonna get, man.
Call me later."
212,MARK,212,Yeah.
213,JENNIFER (ON PHONE),213,Hello?
214,JENNIFER (ON PHONE),214,"Hello? I can hear you breathing. Is
this a rapist?"
215,MARK,215,"No, it's Mark. I'm sorry."
216,MARK,216,"Shut the fuck up, I don't even have
a job!"
217,LANDLORD,217,I'm here for the rent.
218,MARK,218,"I was going to come talk to you
about that. I got fired yesterday."
219,LANDLORD,219,"I know. That's why I'm here for the
rent."
220,MARK,220,"Well, I haven't got it."
221,LANDLORD,221,How much do you have?
222,MARK,222,"I think I've got about three
hundred dollars in my bank account."
223,LANDLORD,223,The rent is eight hundred dollars.
224,MARK,224,I know. I haven't got it.
225,LANDLORD,225,"Then you're evicted. I'll help you
with your things."
226,LANDLORD,226,"Help me with the couch. It looks
heavy."
227,LANDLORD,227,"You have one day to get your things
out of this hallway."
228,MARK,228,How am I supposed to do that?
229,LANDLORD,229,"You've got three hundred dollars.
Rent a truck."
230,MARK,230,"Oh, fuck me."
231,BANK TELLER,231,How can I help you today?
232,MARK,232,I'd like to make a withdrawal.
233,BANK TELLER,233,"Okay, sir. I'm confident I can help
you with that."
234,MARK,234,"I've just been evicted from my
apartment so I need to withdraw
what I have left in my account so I
can move my things out. I guess I
need to close out my account to do
that."
235,MARK,235,I think I'm about to be homeless.
236,BANK TELLER,236,"Unfortunately sir the system is
down right now so I'm not going to
be able to perform an account
closure until the system is back
up. But I can assist you in a
withdrawal. How much would you like
to withdraw?"
237,MARK,237,"Well, I'd like to withdraw eight
hundred dollars."
238,BANK TELLER,238,"How much are you going to withdraw
today, sir?"
239,MARK,239,All of it. Just whatever is left.
240,BANK TELLER,240,"The system is down, sir. Please
tell me how much you have in your
account?"
241,BANK TELLER,241,Sir?
242,MARK,242,Eight hundred dollars.
243,BANK TELLER,243,Pardon me?
244,MARK,244,"I have eight hundred dollars in my
bank account."
245,BANK TELLER,245,"Wait a second here. The system just
came back up."
246,BANK TELLER,246,"System seems to be back up, guys."
247,BANK TELLER,247,"Just one second while I access your
account. You said you're
withdrawing eight hundred, correct?"
248,MARK,248,Yup.
249,BANK TELLER,249,"Well, look at this. It says here
you've only got three hundred
dollars in your account. But you
said you wanted to withdraw eight
hundred?"
250,BANK TELLER,250,"I apologize for this sir, but it
seems our system has made a
mistake. Hold on one second while I
go and get your eight hundred
dollars. Did you want that in large
or small bills?"
251,MARK,251,Large bills.
252,BANK TELLER,252,"Guys the computers seem to be a bit
buggy. Will someone call James to
come in and look into it, please?"
253,BANK TELLER,253,"There you are. Eight hundred
dollars. Anything else I can do for
you today?"
254,BANK TELLER,254,"Sometimes our computers can get a
bit buggy, especially when the
system goes down. Sorry for any
inconvenience."
255,MARK,255,It's no problem.
256,LANDLORD,256,What are you doing here?
257,MARK,257,Paying my rent.
258,LANDLORD,258,Where did you get this money?
259,MARK,259,"It was amazing. I went in to the
bank and the system was down and I
was going to take out three hundred
dollars but she asked me how much
I'd like to take out and..."
260,MARK,260,I found it. Lying on the street.
261,LANDLORD,261,Okay. Lucky.
262,MARK,262,Give me my key back.
263,MARK (V.O.),263,"Today I stumbled upon something no
man has ever stumbled upon before.
What I have done today they will
write about in history books for
generations to come. And yet, only
moments ago... it was unfathomable
not only to myself, but to mankind
as a whole. What I have found there
is no word for. And it was as
simple as..."
264,MARK (V.O.),264,... how do I explain this...
265,MARK (CONT'D),265,"... I said something... that
wasn't."
266,GREG,266,Huh?
267,MARK,267,"I said something... that... wasn't.
I... what's the word I'm looking
for? Well, there is no word. Of
course there's not, I just invented
it."
268,MARK,268,Here. Watch.
269,MARK,269,Jim.
270,JIM,270,What?
271,MARK,271,My name is Doug.
272,GREG,272,Your name is Doug.
273,JIM,273,Hi Doug.
274,GREG,274,"It amazes me that I never knew your
real name."
275,GREG,275,Doug is good. It suits you.
276,MARK,276,"Come on guys. Are you serious?
What's my name?"
277,GREG,277,It's Doug.
278,JIM,278,Doug.
279,MARK,279,No. My name is Mark.
280,GREG,280,Your name is Mark.
281,JIM,281,Hi Mark.
282,GREG,282,Mark suits you much better.
283,JIM,283,Mark-o.
284,MARK,284,You guys aren't following me.
285,MARK,285,"Okay, guys...I'm black."
286,GREG,286,I knew it.
287,JIM,287,"You're very light skinned, but I
can see it."
288,GREG,288,I've always wanted a black friend.
289,MARK,289,"Fuck it, I'm an Eskimo."
290,GREG,290,Fantastic.
291,JIM,291,I've never seen a black Eskimo.
292,MARK,292,"Okay, I'm a pirate."
293,GREG,293,I didn't know they still had those.
294,JIM,294,Are you a dangerous pirate?
295,MARK,295,"Okay then, I'm a lion tamer... and
I have purple hair."
296,GREG,296,"Aren't you scared you'll get bitten
one day?"
297,JIM,297,"I want to die my hair purple just
like Mark's."
298,JIM,298,"I'm a one-armed Jewish space
explorer."
299,GREG,299,When's your launch date?
300,JIM,300,Shalom. How'd you lose your arm?
301,MARK,301,I invented the bicycle.
302,GREG,302,I love your work.
303,JIM,303,"Can you get me a discount on a ten
speed?"
304,MARK,304,I give up. And I'm bored.
305,MARK,305,"Guys, if you had the power to make
things the way you wanted them,
what would you do first?"
306,GREG,306,"If I could do anything in the
world?"
307,JIM,307,Anything at all?
308,MARK,308,Pretty much.
309,GREG,309,I'd bone bitches asses.
310,JIM,310,Right in the ass.
311,MARK,311,Specifically the ass?
312,GREG,312,"If I could change things I would
make all the hot chicks bone me."
313,JIM,313,Agreed.
314,MARK,314,"Alright then, let's try that."
315,GREG,315,Where are you going?
316,MARK,316,Out.
317,BLONDE,317,"Don't look at me, I'm not attracted
to you."
318,MARK,318,Wait!
319,BLONDE,319,"Don't bother. I've heard it all
before."
320,MARK,320,"THE WORLD IS GOING TO END IF WE
DON'T HAVE SEX RIGHT NOW!"
321,BLONDE,321,"Do we have time to get to a motel
or do we have to do it right here?"
322,BLONDE,322,"I'm sorry, I'm just so scared. I
don't want the world to end."
323,BLONDE (cont'd),323,"I don't want to die in this motel
room. I think I'm going to throw
up. Help me get my pants off."
324,MARK,324,This isn't right.
325,BLONDE,325,"No! We have to have sex! The world
is going to end! Think of the
children and little babies!"
326,MARK,326,Just calm down for one second.
327,BLONDE,327,"How can I be calm? The world might
end any second! DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND?! WE'RE ALL GOING TO
DIE!!"
328,MARK,328,"Hello... NASA? Yes, it's... me. Oh,
good. That's very good news. Good
news indeed."
329,MARK,329,"We're going to be okay. The world
isn't going to end. Everyone is
going to be fine."
330,BLONDE,330,"WE'RE GOING TO LIVE! We're going to
live! Thank you! Thank you!"
331,BLONDE,331,"This has been the worst... and the
best... day of my life."
332,MARK,332,"Okay, I gotta go."
333,BLONDE,333,"Oh no, please stay. We've been
through so much together."
334,MARK,334,I'm an asshole.
335,BLONDE,335,"Well, I hate assholes. Get out of
here."
336,MARK,336,"That was one of the worst
experiences of my life."
337,GREG,337,Did you invent a new kind of bike?
338,MARK,338,"What else would you do if you could
do anything in the world?"
339,GREG,339,"Bone chicks asses. That's what I'd
do."
340,MARK,340,"What else though. What's the second
thing you'd do."
341,GREG,341,"What else would you do, dipshit?"
342,MARK,342,"I'd get money. I'd get all the
money."
343,MARK,343,"Yeah. Let's do that. Greg, let's
go."
344,GREG,344,What?
345,MARK,345,We're going on a trip.
346,GREG,346,I'll drive.
347,MARK,347,"Thanks for driving man, I'm
completely plastered."
348,GREG,348,"I'm just as hammered as you. But I
don't care if I get arrested. I'm
trying to hit bottom."
349,GREG,349,Here comes bottom.
350,COP,350,"Nothing safer than pulling over two
nerdy white guys in their forties."
351,GREG,351,I don't want to go to jail.
352,COP,352,Are you drunk?
353,GREG,353,Yes.
354,COP,354,"Then you're going to jail.
Blow in here, son."
355,MARK,355,"Wait, officer. Don't do that."
356,COP,356,"I don't think you can afford my
bribe, son."
357,MARK,357,How much does it cost to bribe you?
358,COP,358,At least five grand.
359,MARK AND GREG,359,"Wow, that's high."
360,COP,360,"I need to feel that I've got some
sense of integrity."
361,COP,361,"Whoa, that's off the charts. Step
out of the car, son. You're drunk
and going to jail."
362,MARK,362,Wait.
363,MARK,363,He's not drunk.
364,COP,364,Oh.
365,COP,365,Damn thing must be broken.
366,COP,366,"Son, you might want to drive
yourself to the nearest hospital.
You have food poisoning or some
kind of flu."
367,COP,367,"Maybe you oughta drive, son."
368,MARK,368,Good idea.
369,MARK,369,That was awesome!
370,GREG,370,"Stop laughing, I'm sick."
371,MARK,371,"You're gonna be all right, Greg."
372,GREG,372,Oh good!
373,GREG,373,Stupid stomach flu.
374,GREG,374,Where are we going?
375,MARK,375,"Vegas, baby. Vegas."
376,GREG,376,"What are we doing here? We don't
have any money to throw away."
377,MARK,377,Sure we do.
378,GREG,378,"What is that, a few hundred bucks?
That's not going to last us very
long."
379,MARK,379,Sure it will.
380,MARK,380,Chips please.
381,CHIP WOMAN,381,"There's a very good chance you'll
lose all this money here tonight."
382,MARK,382,I know.
383,CHIP WOMAN,383,"And even if you do happen to win,
there's an even better chance that
in the long run we'll win it back."
384,MARK,384,I know.
385,CHIP WOMAN,385,"Some of the games are fixed. Like
all the ones that use computers."
386,MARK,386,I know.
387,COCKTAIL WAITRESS,387,"If I could be a stripper I would,
but I'm not attractive enough.
Drinks, guys?"
388,GREG,388,No. I have a stomach flu.
389,MARK,389,"We'll both have beers and we'll
take them at that roulette table
over there."
390,GREG,390,"Oh come on, roulette is the
stupidest game of them all. It's
pure chance, no skill whatsoever."
391,MARK,391,It's okay. I'm feeling lucky.
392,GREG,392,"You've never had a lucky day in
your life."
393,MARK,393,Just watch.
394,ROULETTE DEALER,394,"Get your bets in, get your bets in.
The house always wins in the long
run. Because of the zero's on the
board every bet is slightly favored
towards the house."
395,ROULETTE DEALER,395,Twenty-seven red. No one wins.
396,MARK,396,I'm on twenty-seven red.
397,ROULETTE DEALER,397,"We have a winner. Congratulations,
sir."
398,GREG,398,"You did it. You just, like,
quadrupled your money. You lucky
son of a bitch."
399,MARK,399,That's nothing. Watch this.
400,ROULETTE DEALER,400,"Get your bets in, get your bets in.
The house always wins in the long
run. Fork over your money right
here folks. I say this so often I
want to kill myself."
401,ROULETTE DEALER,401,Nine black. No winners.
402,MARK,402,"I'm on nine black. These are all
mine."
403,ROULETTE DEALER,403,"Nine black wins. Big winner.
Congratulations, sir."
404,GREG,404,Do it again.
405,MARK,405,"I don't think I should. Lets go
play slots."
406,MARK,406,"Hi, I just won a major jackpot on
this slot machine but no money came
out."
407,PIT MAN,407,"I'm sorry about that, sir. Let me
get that fixed for you. And can I
say congratulations, sir."
408,MARK,408,Thank you.
409,GREG,409,"This is the most amazing night of
my life."
410,GREG,410,"It amazes me the winning streak
you're on. You must be the luckiest
man in the world."
411,MARK,411,"Well, sort of."
412,GREG,412,It was like we couldn't lose.
413,MARK,413,We couldn't lose.
414,GREG,414,Do you have a system?
415,MARK,415,I've got a system.
416,GREG,416,"Well, with your system in just a
few weeks I figure we could be the
richest people in the world."
417,MARK,417,And then what?
418,GREG,418,"Well, here's what I'm thinking. We
take all the money in the world...
and put it on black."
419,MARK,419,"Why put it on black? Why stop
there? Put it on a number and get
thirty five times back."
420,GREG,420,That's exactly what we'll do.
421,MARK,421,"Hold on, I think I found a flaw in
your plan. How can they pay us if
we have all the money in the world?"
422,GREG,422,"Well, they'd just have to."
423,MARK,423,"Well, they can't because we've got
it all."
424,GREG,424,"Well, they'd better find it. They
can't let us bet if they're not
going to pay us back. They'll have
to just give us the casino."
425,MARK,425,"We already own the casino. We've
got all the money in the world.
We'll be betting against ourselves."
426,GREG,426,Then we'll go to another casino.
427,MARK,427,We own that one too. We won that.
428,GREG,428,So we own all the casino's?
429,MARK,429,Yup.
430,GREG,430,"And if we win we can't pay us back
because we already have all the
money?"
431,MARK,431,Yes.
432,GREG,432,Only one thing we can do then.
433,MARK,433,I'm listening.
434,GREG,434,"Take ourselves into the back room
and break our own fingers."
435,MARK,435,Brilliant.
436,MARK,436,"Hey there, Frank."
437,FRANK,437,Mark. How's it going?
438,MARK,438,"Pretty good, thanks."
439,FRANK,439,Really?
440,MARK,440,Yeah. You?
441,FRANK,441,"Awful. I was doing some internet
research last night about
suffocation suicide. I'm probably
going to give that a try tonight."
442,MARK,442,Oh.
443,MARK,443,"All right. Bye, Frank."
444,FRANK,444,Bye.
445,MARK,445,Frank!
446,FRANK,446,Yeah?
447,MARK,447,Don't do it.
448,FRANK,448,"Why not? I'm miserable. And no one
will care."
449,MARK,449,I'll care.
450,FRANK,450,"You're a loser, though."
451,MARK,451,"Don't do it, Frank. Things are
going to be all right."
452,FRANK,452,They are?
453,MARK,453,"Yes. You're going to meet someone
soon. You won't be so lonely.
Things are going to turn around at
your job."
454,FRANK,454,My job's actually fine.
455,MARK,455,"Well, things are going to get
better. Better than they are."
456,FRANK,456,What about the depression?
457,MARK,457,"It will go away very soon. You're
going to be happy soon, Frank. You
just need to wait for it. Listen to
me: you don't need to kill
yourself."
458,FRANK,458,Really?
459,MARK,459,Really.
460,FRANK,460,"Wow. Man, and that suffocation
thing really seemed like a good
idea."
461,MARK,461,It wasn't.
462,FRANK,462,"Okay. Well, my night's open now.
You want to hang out later?"
463,MARK,463,I don't know. Not really.
464,MARK,464,Sure. Of course. Let's hang out.
465,FRANK,465,I'll see you after work.
466,MARK,466,Great.
467,MARK (V.O.),467,"I've discovered something today
very important... and very
powerful."
468,MARK (V.O.),468,"I'm as excited as I've ever been in
my entire life, and equally scared."
469,MARK (V.O.) (cont'd),469,"I'm writing this down in a letter
in case this thing I've discovered
somehow ends up killing me. I want
to ensure that, even if I wasn't
strong enough to use it, that my
invention doesn't once again
disappear, never to be discovered
again."
470,MARK (V.O.),470,"In just a few hours since I
stumbled upon my discovery I have
seen its potential for evil and I
have seen its potential for good."
471,MARK (V.O.),471,"I must be careful with my
discovery, for at this point I
barely understand it, let alone
think I have the power to control
it. All I know is that if I'm not
careful I could easily do
irreparable damage to the world, or
even cause my own premature death."
472,MARK (V.O.),472,"Now, to explain my invention. In
essence, my creation is the act of
saying words that simply are not.
For example, if I tell someone that
my eyes are blue, then it simply
becomes fact. I still know that,
indeed, my eyes are brown, but no
one else is aware of this fact, so
therefore I have blue eyes."
473,MARK (V.O.) (cont'd),473,"It's a game of numbers: there is
only one of me who knows I have
brown eyes, and so many of them who
do not. The numbers always win."
474,MARK,474,"Whoever is reading this, go ahead
and try it. Tell someone your eyes
are a different color then they
are. I think you'll be amazed at
the results. It's so simple and
yet... so powerful... this thing
I've invented."
475,MARK (V.O.),475,"Au Revoir, future reader, au
revoir."
476,MARK,476,Jennifer. It's Mark.
477,JENNIFER,477,Are you gonna hang up on me again?
478,MARK,478,"No. Maybe. Who knows. I'm calling
because I want to ask you out on
another date."
479,JENNIFER,479,Why would you do that?
480,MARK,480,"I discovered something yesterday. I
found out I can pretty much have my
life anyway I want it from now on."
481,JENNIFER,481,Congratulations. I gotta go.
482,MARK,482,"Wait, and I know you said you
didn't want to date me ever again,
but I'm different now. Things have
changed. I think I'm in your league
now."
483,JENNIFER,483,You're better looking?
484,MARK,484,"No. I'm not better looking. I'm
just more... powerful. I think you
have to see it for yourself."
485,JENNIFER,485,Have you been to the gym?
486,MARK,486,"No, I haven't been to the gym. It's
just... it's amazing. Things are
different for me now. You have to
see this. I think you'll hardly
recognize me."
487,JENNIFER,487,Did you buy better clothes?
488,MARK,488,"No, look can we just meet up?"
489,MARK,489,"Jennifer, If there was even a
glimmer of something about me that
you liked, please say yes. You even
admitted that we got along well.
Just give me one more chance. Just
one little teensy, tiny date."
490,JENNIFER,490,"Okay, fine."
491,MARK,491,"Fantastic. Tomorrow night. I'll
pick you up at eight."
492,JENNIFER,492,"Most likely it'll be our last date
though, so just know that."
493,MARK,493,That's very sweet.
494,JENNIFER,494,"No it wasn't. Did you not hear what
I said?"
495,MARK,495,"Yeah, no I was being..."
496,MARK,496,"...there's no word for it. See you
tomorrow night."
497,JENNIFER,497,Bye.
498,MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V),498,In Our World.... in the 1800's...
499,MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V),499,"... came the greatest revolution of
them all."
500,MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V),500,The Industrial Revolution.
501,MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V),501,"Written by famed screenwriter Rob
Marlowe and read by Oscar winning
Reader Angelo Badsmith."
502,ANGELO BADSMITH,502,"Hello, I'm Angelo Badmsith. Come
watch me read about the exciting
events that took place during the
Industrial Revolution."
503,ANGELO BADSMITH (cont'd),503,"Also, I will tell you all about my
personal misfortunes, such as my
wife who cheated on me with a man
named Perry."
504,MARK,504,"Rob Marlowe, your streak of success
has finally come to an end."
505,SHELLEY (O.S.),505,He's gone crazy!
506,ROB,506,"Come to beg for your old job back?
Hey everybody, here's the loser who
thought the Black Plague would make
for an interesting film. Good luck,
douche bag. Freaking loser."
507,ANTHONY (ON PHONE),507,"They're going to fire me any
moment, I just know it. I'm really,
really horrible at my job. I don't
know anything about movies. I don't
even like movies. I like sports.
Head of development, what does that
even mean? I'm not a smart person.
Okay, talk to you later."
508,ANTHONY,508,That was the head of the studio.
509,ANTHONY,509,"I'm very scared that you're mad at
me about the whole firing thing."
510,MARK,510,I'm not mad at all.
511,ANTHONY,511,"Oh good, because I feel really bad
about it. I mean, I would be
horrible at your job too. I would
be horrible at any job in this
place."
512,ANTHONY,512,I love sports.
513,ANTHONY,513,Why are you here?
514,MARK,514,"When you fired me, I was very
depressed."
515,ANTHONY,515,I knew it.
516,MARK,516,"And so I left this building and I
just started walking. And I walked
all the way out of town. And then I
walked into the desert and I fell
asleep under a tree."
517,ANTHONY,517,"I don't do well with other people's
life changing events."
518,MARK,518,"And when I woke up I found this
strange old chest sticking out of
the ground. So I started digging.
And I unearthed a very old and
ancient box. Probably, oh...
about... seven hundred years old.
And inside the box..."
519,MARK,519,... was this.
520,ANTHONY,520,What is it?
521,MARK,521,"It's a never-before-heard
historical event from the past."
522,ANTHONY,522,When does it take place?
523,MARK,523,The 1300's.
524,ANTHONY,524,"I told you we're not interested in
Black Plague movies here, Mark."
525,MARK,525,"This one isn't about the black
plague. Well it isn't just about
the black plague. Let me read you
some of this."
526,MARK,526,"Anthony, get excited about this.
This is a brand new event from
history that no one has ever heard
before. It's a great human
discovery."
527,ANTHONY,527,"Yeah, but is there a movie there?"
528,MARK,528,"The greatest movie Lecture Films
has ever made."
529,ANTHONY,529,Start reading.
530,MARK,530,"On the very first day of the
fourteenth century, a momentous
occasion occurred. It began as a
day much like any other. The sun
rose, the people awoke, workers
began to work, babies began to cry.
But all of that was interrupted
when a giant flying space ship
crashed down from the skies and
landed in the heart of Babylon."
531,ANTHONY,531,What?!
532,ANTHONY (ON PHONE),532,"I want everyone in here now! We've
got a BIG ONE."
533,ANTHONY,533,"Please, Mark. Continue."
534,MARK,534,"As the smoke cleared, the door to
the spaceship opened and inside,
were hundreds of beautiful, half
naked alien women."
535,MARK,535,"And then the ninja army unleashed a
giant fireball that brought the
robot dinosaur to its knees, saving
Mars, Earth and the Nude Amazonian
Alien Women all in one sweeping
motion. The earth was saved.
Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to
marry by alien king Xardon. It was
to be the First Human-Nude
Amazonian Alien Woman wedding, and
no expenses would be spared. All of
Babylon and Mars were invited to
join in the celebrations."
536,MARK,536,"The wedding was held on a brisk
summers day on Mars, with all of
the survivors of the Great Ninja
War and the Black Plague present.
They feasted and danced and laughed
and it was a joyous occasion."
537,MARK (cont'd),537,"The moment the bride and groom
kissed, King Xardon performed a
mind-wipe on all of the humans,
thereby erasing all knowledge of
these events from their minds, and
sent them back to Babylon. For
seven hundred years these events
would be forgotten by mankind until
one day, a great writer by the name
of Mark Bellison, would stumble
upon them in the desert, after
being fired by his shit boss
Anthony and mocked by Rob and
Shelly, two huge douche bags.
Lecture Films Motion Picture
Studios would go on to make the
picture and it would be a big
success, and Mark would become very
wealthy and famous from it. The
End."
538,ANTHONY,538,"Mark, tell us what it's called."
539,MARK,539,The Black Plague.
540,JENNIFER,540,"Congratulations on selling your
script today."
541,MARK,541,"Thanks. Thank you for having dinner
with me."
542,JENNIFER,542,Everyone needs to eat.
543,JENNIFER,543,And I enjoy your company.
544,WAITER,544,I'm an extremely important waiter.
545,WAITER,545,What can I get you?
546,MARK,546,"I don't want to know what it is, I
just want to order the most
expensive thing on the menu."
547,JENNIFER,547,"I'll have the duck. And I think you
look like a little rat faced man."
548,WAITER,548,"Okay, I'll have those right up for
you."
549,JENNIFER,549,"Things seem to be turning around
for you."
550,MARK,550,"Today is the best day of my life.
Hands down. Easy. Best day."
551,JENNIFER,551,"It's not every day you unearth a
monumental historical event and
sell it for a ton of money."
552,MARK,552,"That wasn't the best part. It was
great, but it wasn't the peak of my
day."
553,MARK,553,"I've had a crush on you ever since
I saw a picture of you on Greg's
refrigerator two years ago."
554,JENNIFER,554,Oh.
555,MARK,555,"The best part of my day today is
right now, sitting at this table
here with you."
556,JENNIFER,556,Oh.
557,MARK,557,"You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen in my life, and
you're special... and it makes me
happy to be around you."
558,JENNIFER,558,Thank you.
559,JENNIFER,559,"Tell me something about your
family. I really don't know much
about you."
560,MARK,560,"Ah, my family. We're what you'd
probably call ""not lucky"". My whole
family is kind of marked by
tragedy, bad luck and general...
shittiness. It goes back a long
ways and could probably drive
someone to suicide just hearing
about it, so I'll keep it simple.
My mom died when I was six. Cancer."
561,JENNIFER,561,Sad.
562,MARK,562,"And my dad got real depressed and
lost his job. Out of work and with
a kid to raise he had no choice but
to turn to a life of crime."
563,JENNIFER,563,What kind of crime?
564,MARK,564,He was a robber. Houses mostly.
565,MARK'S DAD (O.S.),565,"Hi, I'm calling to let you know
I'll be robbing your house today.
I'll probably be there within the
hour."
566,MARK'S DAD (O.S.),566,I hope you're not there.
567,MARK,567,"He was a very unlucky man. He spent
his last days behind bars. I never
really knew him."
568,MARK,568,"But I guess I've also had a little
luck in my life. I did have a
wonderful grandmother who raised
me."
569,JENNIFER,569,"Oh, that's sweet."
570,MARK,570,"Yeah, she's great."
571,JENNIFER,571,Where is she?
572,MARK,572,"Old person's home obviously. Who
wants to live with that? Gross."
573,JENNIFER,573,"I know, right?"
574,MARK,574,"But I'm going to get her out of
there tomorrow."
575,MARK (cont'd),575,"I'm going to buy her a big
beautiful mansion where she can
spend her few remaining days in
luxury."
576,JENNIFER,576,That's nice.
577,WAITER,577,"I don't know what's wrong with the
chef today, but these just look
awful."
578,MARK,578,They look fine to me.
579,WAITER,579,"Well, you're stupid."
580,MARK,580,"Right. I was thinking that since
I'm going to be rich and successful
now that I might be in your league."
581,MARK,581,"And that maybe we could be
together. Romantically."
582,JENNIFER,582,What would be the point?
583,MARK,583,"Well, I don't know, maybe we might
enjoy it. Maybe we'd be good
together and could have a happy
life, raise a family together."
584,JENNIFER,584,"Well, I do like you. And I enjoy
your company."
585,JENNIFER (cont'd),585,"And if we were to get together and
procreate I would like the
offspring that are carrying half my
genetic code to be well taken care
of and financially stable. I also
think you'd make a good father and
a good husband, which I like."
586,MARK,586,Good. Fantastic.
587,JENNIFER,587,"Unfortunately, none of that changes
the fact that you'd still be
contributing half of the genetic
code to our children."
588,JENNIFER,588,"I don't want short, fat kids with
little snub noses."
589,MARK,589,Sure.
590,MARK (ON PHONE),590,Hello?
591,MARK (ON PHONE),591,What?
592,MARK (ON PHONE),592,WHAT?
593,MARK,593,"Grandma, they just called me.
What's going on? Are you okay?"
594,MARTHA,594,"I don't know, I fell on my way back
to my room."
595,MARK,595,What do the doctors say?
596,MARTHA,596,They say I'll probably die tonight.
597,MARK,597,What?
598,DOCTOR,598,"Oh, hello. I was just coming in to
check on her, you must be Martha
Bellison's grandson."
599,MARK,599,"What are you talking about she's
going to die?"
600,DOCTOR,600,"I'm sorry. It just doesn't look
good. She's suffered a major heart
attack and her heart is very weak,
her pulse not very strong, her
blood pressure is dropping rapidly
and most likely she'll have a fatal
heart attack during the night."
601,MARK,601,Fuck.
602,DOCTOR,602,"Yup, still going to die."
603,DOCTOR,603,"I'm sorry, guys. I wish I felt
something for you two, but I really
don't. I do this exact thing about
thirty times a night and it's
really hardened me to human
suffering. On a side note, it's
fajita night at the cafeteria
downstairs. You might think about
grabbing a bite to eat there after
your grandma dies."
604,MARTHA,604,"I'm so scared, Mark. I don't want
to die. You know, people don't talk
about it much, but death is a
horrible thing. One minute you're
alive, there's a whole world around
you, humming and jumping, people
coming in and out, doors opening
and closing, love and anger and the
whole mess of it all, and then like
that, it's all gone."
605,MARTHA,605,"This is it Mark, only a few hours
left of this until an eternity of
nothingness."
606,MARK,606,Grandma!
607,NURSE #1,607,She's seizing.
608,MARTHA,608,I'm scared.
609,MARK,609,"Listen closely to me, Grandma. I
have a surprise for you."
610,MARK,610,"You're wrong about what happens
when you die. It's not an eternity
of nothingness."
611,MARK,611,"When you die you're going to go to
your favorite place in the whole
world. And you're going to be with
all of the people you've ever loved
and who have ever loved you. And
you're going to be young again, and
you'll be able to run through the
fields and dance and jump, and
there will be no sadness, no pain,
just love and laughing and
happiness. There will be ponies
made of gold, and everyone will
live in giant mansions, and
everything will smell like cookies.
And it will last for an eternity,
Grandma. An eternity."
612,NURSE #1,612,Go on.
613,DOCTOR,613,What else happens?
614,MARK,614,Do your jobs!
615,MARK,615,"You're going to be happy forever,
grandma. I promise you. Say hello
to my mom for me. Tell her I love
her."
616,NURSE #2,616,"I'm going to see my mother again
when I die."
617,DOCTOR,617,"Tell us more, please."
618,MARK,618,Damn it.
619,JENNIFER,619,"I'm so sorry, Mark."
620,MARK,620,I think I just did something bad.
621,JENNIFER,621,Do you want to come inside?
622,JENNIFER,622,Hi.
623,MARK,623,Hi.
624,NURSE #1,624,There he is!
625,PERSON #1,625,"Is there only one place you go when
you die?"
626,PERSON #2,626,"Will everyone who has ever died be
there?"
627,PERSON #3,627,What's this place called?
628,PERSON #4,628,"Will I get to have sex with people
there?"
629,NURSE #1,629,"You owe us an explanation. If you
know something this important, you
better tell us all."
630,MARK,630,Who are you people?
631,NURSE #1,631,"The words you spoke last night, to
your grandmother, spread like
wildfire. Please, tell us more.
Explain what you said."
632,MARK,632,"Fine, fine, just give me a minute."
633,JENNIFER (V.O.),633,"You've been gone for twenty minutes
and I turn on the T.V to see you on
every station. What's going on?
This is seriously the weirdest
thing..."
634,MARK,634,"Remember last night when I said I
think I did something bad? Well now
I know I did something bad."
635,JENNIFER,635,"They're saying that you know
something different about what
happens after you die."
636,MARK,636,Hold on.
637,REPORTER (ON T.V),637,"Twenty-four hours ago, Mark
Bellison was just your typical
nobody writer."
638,REPORTER (ON T.V) (cont'd),638,"Today, people are saying he knows
new information about what happens
after you die."
639,MARK,639,Fuck.
640,JENNIFER,640,"Mark, what do you know? What did
you tell your grandmother last
night? What's going on?"
641,MARK,641,"I can't explain it all right now.
Why don't you come over?"
642,JENNIFER,642,Okay.
643,MARK,643,"Come up quick, they look like they
could get out of hand any second."
644,JENNIFER,644,"Just tell me what you told your
grandmother."
645,MARK,645,"I don't think I should. Who knows
what could happen next? I'm just
going to keep my mouth shut from
now on."
646,JENNIFER,646,"What you said obviously affected a
lot of people. I don't think you
have the choice to keep it in now."
647,MARK,647,"Sure I do. I could just walk out
that door and get on a plane and go
to Namibia. No one knows me in
Namibia."
648,JENNIFER,648,"Just tell me what you said. Please,
Mark."
649,MARK,649,"My grandmother was dying, and she
was terrified, shaking all over.
She didn't want to just become
nothingness. So I told her that
when she died there wouldn't be
nothingness. That she would be with
all of the people she loved who had
died and that she would live an
eternity of joy and happiness."
650,JENNIFER,650,How do you know these things?
651,JENNIFER,651,"You have to tell them everything
you know. This is too big. You have
no choice."
652,MARK,652,"But you don't understand. The words
I said... they weren't... it's not
right."
653,JENNIFER,653,"How did your grandmother feel when
you told her these things?"
654,MARK,654,Happy. At peace.
655,JENNIFER,655,And how did that make you feel?
656,MARK,656,Good.
657,JENNIFER,657,"Think how good it will feel to do
the same for all of these people."
658,MARK,658,"Okay. But I need a few hours to get
my thoughts together."
659,JENNIFER,659,I'll go tell them.
660,MARK,660,Wait! Are you sure this is right?
661,JENNIFER,661,"Of course it is. You know something
that's going to change mankind
forever. It's the most important
thing the world has ever heard."
662,GREG,662,"I brought pizza. How come you never
told me we all get mansions?"
663,MARK,663,I didn't...
664,GREG,664,"Inventing the bicycle is one thing,
but this..."
665,JENNIFER,665,Shut up. Let him work.
666,NEWSCASTER (ON T.V),666,"In Seoul Korea, they wait. In Rome,
Italy, they wait. In London,
England, they wait. In New York
City, they wait. The world has come
to a standstill, everyone at their
televisions and radios, or here on
this lawn, waiting for Mark
Bellison to come forth and tell the
people what he knows."
667,MARK,667,I'm done.
668,JENNIFER,668,Are you ready?
669,MARK,669,I guess.
670,MARK,670,"I feel like I should be reading
these off of something other than
just notebook paper. I wish they
were like, written on large tablets
or even just nicer paper or
something."
671,MARK,671,Feels better.
672,JENNIFER,672,Just tell them what you know
673,GREG,673,"Good luck out there, man."
674,YOUNG MAN,674,"I heard that he said we all get
mansions, and that there's even
ponies."
675,NEWSCASTER,675,"Ponies. Mansions. Ice Cream. These
are the things we can all expect
when we die. What else can we
expect? We won't know until Mark
Bellison steps out of that..."
676,YOUNG MAN,676,THERE HE IS!
677,MARK,677,Hello.
678,MARK,678,"Oh, thanks."
679,MARK,679,Wow.
680,MARK,680,"So. I guess you've all heard the
things I told my grandmother last
night and... I understand why
you're here."
681,MARK,681,"I know... some things. Some very
important things. And I'm going to
share these things with you now."
682,MARK,682,"Everything you want to know is
written here. On this old pizza
box."
683,MARK,683,"Number one: There is a man who
lives in the sky who controls
everything. Number two..."
684,MAN #1,684,"Whoa, whoa whoa. What does he look
like?"
685,MARK,685,"Tall. Big hands. A good head of
hair."
686,WOMAN #1,686,What ethnicity is he?
687,MARK,687,"He's a new ethnicity. It's like a
mix of all of our ethnicities."
688,MAN #2,688,Does he live on a cloud?
689,MAN #3,689,Can we see him?
690,MARK,690,"No. He lives much higher than the
clouds, too high to see."
691,WOMAN #2,691,So he lives in space?
692,MARK,692,"No, not that high."
693,MAN #3,693,So you mean the Thermosphere?
694,MARK,694,"Look, people I got a lot to get
through here. I'm just telling you
what I know: Man. Lives in the sky.
You can't see him. Controls
everything. Cool?"
695,MARK,695,"Number two: When you die you don't
disappear into an eternity of
nothingness. Instead, you go to a
really great place."
696,MARK,696,"Number three: In that place every
person will get a mansion."
697,MAN #4,697,What kind of mansion?
698,MARK,698,"I don't know. Whatever kind of
mansion you're thinking of right
now."
699,WOMAN #3,699,"Oh no! I wasn't thinking of a
mansion!"
700,MAN #5,700,"Shit! I was thinking of a horrible
mansion!"
701,MARK,701,"Look, it's the best mansion you can
think of, not just now, but ever.
Whatever the best mansion for you
can possibly be, that's the one
you'll get."
702,MARK,702,"Number four: When you die, all the
people you love will be there too."
703,MAN #6,703,Will they have their own mansions?
704,MARK,704,"Yes, of course. Everyone gets a
mansion."
705,MAN #6,705,"What if I want them to live in my
mansion?"
706,MARK,706,"If they want to live with you, they
can leave their mansion and live in
yours."
707,MAN #6,707,What happens to their mansion?
708,MARK,708,"I don't know, it goes back on the
market."
709,WOMAN #4,709,"What about the people I hate? Will
they be there too?"
710,MARK,710,No.
711,MARK,711,WOMAN #5
712,MARK,712,WOMAN #5
713,MARK,713,MAN #8
714,MARK,714,WOMAN #6
715,MARK (cont'd),715,"Number six: If you do bad things
you won't get to go to this great
place when you die."
716,MAN #9,716,Where will you go?
717,MARK,717,"A terrible place. The worst place
imaginable."
718,WOMAN #7,718,What constitutes a bad thing?
719,MARK,719,"Murder. Crime. Rape. Things like
that."
720,WOMAN #7,720,"You have to tell us all the things
or else we might do them and it
wouldn't be our fault!"
721,MARK,721,Fine.
722,MAN #9,722,Is punching someone bad?
723,MARK,723,Yes.
724,MAN #9,724,What if they're trying to hurt you?
725,MARK,725,Then it's fine.
726,WOMAN #7,726,Is cursing bad?
727,MARK,727,No.
728,WOMAN #1,728,What about being late for work?
729,MARK,729,"That's fine too. I mean, you might
lose your job if your boss doesn't
like it, but it won't effect what
happens after you die."
730,WOMAN #2,730,"What about if you forget to feed
your dog?"
731,MARK,731,"That also is fine. Unless the dog
dies. Then it's bad."
732,MAN #1,732,"If you do just one bad thing do you
go to the bad place?"
733,MARK,733,No. You get...
734,MARK,734,"... three chances. If you do three
bad things you're out."
735,MAN #1,735,Like baseball!
736,MARK,736,"Kind of, yes."
737,MARK,737,Any more?
738,MARK,738,"Look, can we just move on?"
739,MAN #2,739,"No! We have to know everything
that's bad!"
740,MARK,740,Fine. Let's start with you...
741,MAN #3,741,Is it bad to wear pants?
742,MARK,742,"No. There's no hairstyle that will
put you in the bad place. Like I've
told you, the main things are
hurting people physically on
purpose, taking people's stuff,
doing things to people they don't
want done, killing people on
purpose. Okay? Are we good?"
743,MARK,743,"I've done many of those bad things.
Is there anything I can do to not
go to the bad place? Help me, I'm
so scared."
744,MARK,744,"Well, you didn't know about these
bad things until I told you just
now so you're fine."
745,MARK,745,Am I fine?
746,WOMAN #5,746,What about me?
747,MARK,747,"You're all fine! I'm only talking
about people who do bad things
starting right now. Everyone else
is fine."
748,MARK,748,"Number seven: The man in the sky
who controls everything decides if
you go to the good place or the bad
place. He also decides who lives
and who dies."
749,MAN #4,749,Does he cause natural disasters?
750,MARK,750,Yes.
751,WOMAN #3,751,Did he cause my mom to get cancer?
752,MARK,752,Yes.
753,WOMAN #4,753,"Did he cause that tree to land on
my car last week?"
754,MARK,754,Yes.
755,BLUE COLLAR GUY,755,"I say fuck the guy that lives in
the sky!"
756,MAN #5,756,Yeah! That guy's a fucking asshole!
757,WOMAN #5,757,"That motherfucker better hope I
never see him face to face!"
758,MAN #6,758,"That guy's a fucking coward! Hiding
up there and doing bad shit to us!
Why doesn't he do it to our faces?"
759,WOMAN #6,759,"We need to stop that motherfucker
before he kills us all!"
760,MARK,760,WAIT!
761,MARK,761,"This guy who lives in the sky and
controls everything is also
responsible for all the good stuff
that happens."
762,MAN #7,762,"He's the guy who saved my life on
that fishing trip when the boat
capsized?"
763,MARK,763,Yup.
764,MAN #7,764,Did he capsize the boat?
765,MARK,765,"Well, yes."
766,WOMAN #7,766,"He's the one who killed my
grandmother and left me those
millions of dollars?"
767,MARK,767,You betcha.
768,WOMAN #3,768,"So is he the same one who cured my
mom's cancer?"
769,MARK,769,That too.
770,MAN #8,770,"So he's kind of a good guy, but
he's also kind of a prick too?"
771,MARK,771,Right. But check this out:
772,MARK,772,"Number eight: Even if the man in
the sky does bad shit to you, he
makes it up to you by giving you an
eternity of good stuff after you
die."
773,WOMAN #1,773,"As long as you don't do any of the
bad stuff you listed, right?"
774,MARK,774,Right. Of course.
775,WOMAN #2,775,So it's kind of a test?
776,MARK,776,Yes. Right.
777,MARK,777,"Well, that's it. That's everything
I know."
778,NURSE #1,778,How do you know these things?
779,MARK,779,The man in the clouds told me.
780,NURSE #1,780,"Yeah, but how come we're just
learning these things now, millions
of years into our existence?"
781,MARK,781,"I don't know, he forgot or
something. I gotta go people, good
night!"
782,MARK,782,You think that went well?
783,MARK,783,"So then the flying duck flew all
the way to Alaska where it met up
with a polar bear who could talk.
And the polar bear's name was
Martin. And the polar bear was
wearing a green cape. And Martin
and the flying duck both had race
cars with their names printed on
the side and..."
784,JENNIFER,784,"I just saw three people climbing
the fence into your backyard. You
really need to think about getting
better security."
785,JENNIFER,785,"Mark, how many of those have you
had?"
786,MARK,786,"But then the evil goblin witch came
in and stole the flying duck's race
car and made the flying duck very
angry."
787,MARK (cont'd),787,"Luckily the Polar Bear was there to
snatch the race car back..."
788,MARK (cont'd),788,"Unfortunately, the witch was a
smart witch and the polar bear was
powerless."
789,ASSISTANT,789,Is that the end?
790,MARK,790,Yeah.
791,ASSISTANT,791,That's a strange ending.
792,MARK,792,"Hey, don't look at me: it's the Man
in the Sky's story."
793,ASSISTANT,793,"You want me to take this over to
Lecture Films?"
794,MARK,794,"Yeah. Tell them to shoot that one
this week."
795,MARK,795,Tell them it's for kids!
796,MARK,796,What?
797,JENNIFER,797,"You haven't left the house in
weeks. Every time I come by you're
just sitting here writing down
stories you get from the Man in the
Sky."
798,MARK,798,"Hey, he's the boss."
799,JENNIFER,799,"Don't you think you should go
outside sometime? You know there's
about five thousand people on our
lawn waiting to ask you questions."
800,MARK,800,"Yeah, yeah."
801,JENNIFER,801,What's with you? You seem sad.
802,JENNIFER,802,"I don't get it. You're a very
successful writer, you've won
countless awards and Oscars..."
803,JENNIFER,803,"You've changed the way people see
the world, the way they see death
and life. You've made the entire
world happy."
804,MARK,804,Not the entire world.
805,JENNIFER,805,"I know. Not you. The one person who
should be happy, the person who has
everything..."
806,MARK,806,Not everything.
807,JENNIFER,807,What else do you want?
808,MARK,808,"I'd trade it all in for you. All of
it."
809,JENNIFER,809,"Well, you've got me. As a friend."
810,MARK,810,Yeah. That's important.
811,MARK (cont'd),811,"But why can't we be together. Why
can't you be with me?"
812,JENNIFER,812,"Because of the whole snub nosed
thing. With kids, your genetics.
You know, fat, short..."
813,MARK,813,Yeah. Okay. Yup.
814,MARK,814,"It's almost a shame that being rich
and powerful and famous doesn't
change your genetics."
815,JENNIFER,815,What?
816,MARK,816,"It would be great if it changed
your genetic material because I
really love you but I just don't..."
817,MARK,817,It does change your genetics.
818,JENNIFER,818,Does it?
819,MARK,819,"No. No, it doesn't. Our kids would
be short and fat with little snub
noses."
820,JENNIFER,820,Right. Too bad.
821,JENNIFER,821,"Anyway, I've come to tell you I
can't go to the movies with you
tonight."
822,MARK,822,Why not?
823,JENNIFER,823,I've got a date.
824,MARK,824,What? With who?
825,JENNIFER,825,Rob Marlowe.
826,MARK,826,"You've got to be fucking... Rob
Marlowe?!? He's a complete and
total asshole."
827,JENNIFER,827,"Not to me. He's very sweet and kind
to me."
828,MARK,828,"Well of course he is, look at you.
I mean, for fuck's sake, a shark
would be nice to you..."
829,JENNIFER,829,It would?
830,MARK,830,"Well no, I mean..."
831,MARK,831,Don't go out with him.
832,JENNIFER,832,Why not? He's a great match for me.
833,MARK,833,What's he got that I don't?
834,JENNIFER,834,"We talked about this. If you and I
got together it wouldn't be fair to
our kids. They have the right to be
attractive and have good genes."
835,JENNIFER,835,"If Rob and I get married You can
move into our mansion with us when
we all die."
836,MARK,836,"I don't want to move into your
fucking mansion. And what are you
doing thinking about marriage with
him already? You haven't even gone
on one date."
837,MARK,837,It's like nothing's changed.
838,JENNIFER,838,"A lot of things have changed. I
wish you could be happy."
839,JENNIFER,839,That's him. Gotta go.
840,MARK,840,He's picking you up here?
841,JENNIFER,841,It was his idea.
842,ROB,842,"What's up? Wow, I can't wait to
have sex with you."
843,ROB,843,"Oh hey there, Mark. You look like
trash."
844,ROB,844,"Come on Jennifer, let's go have
some fun. And then have some sex."
845,JENNIFER,845,I'll call you tomorrow.
846,GREG,846,Who was that?
847,MARK,847,"Hey, watch this."
848,MARK,848,HEY PEOPLE!
849,MARK,849,"The man in the sky just told me
something!"
850,MARK,850,You're all gay!
851,MARK,851,And adopted!
852,GREG,852,"I don't know why we're laughing.
It's really probably very sad for
those people."
853,MARK,853,I'm gettin' a beer.
854,MARK,854,Out of beer. Just Coke.
855,MARK,855,"I want to do something big again.
Like telling the people what
happens when they die. That felt
good. I gotta do something big like
that again."
856,GREG,856,"Maybe the Man in the Sky will tell
you something new."
857,MARK,857,Maybe.
858,GREG,858,"Ugh, this shit is so bad for you. I
really shouldn't drink this."
859,MARK,859,"Hey, Greg. What if I told you that
drinking Coke was good for you?"
860,MARK,860,"And not just Coke. But all the
delicious foods you're not supposed
to eat. What if they were all of a
sudden really, really good for you?"
861,GREG,861,"It would be the happiest day of my
life."
862,MARK,862,"Gentleman, thank you all for coming
here on such short notice. I have
some very big news for you all
today."
863,EXECUTIVE #1,863,Is it from the Man in the Sky?
864,MARK,864,"Nope, this one I came up with all
on my own. And it's going to change
the way you all do business...
forever."
865,MARK,865,"Up until now, all products sold
worldwide have warning labels
printed on them. Warnings like
these."
866,MARK,866,"As you can see, a lot of these
products can be very depressing.
They remind people of all the
horrible things that can happen to
them in life. People hate thinking
about horrible things."
867,EXECUTIVE #2,867,"Yeah, but they have to know those
things."
868,EXECUTIVE #2 (cont'd),868,"They have to be able to protect
themselves.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
Especially now that I know about
the ""bad place""."
869,MARK,869,"Hear me out, fellas. Allow me to
introduce you to the future of your
companies."
870,EXECUTIVE #3,870,"Where can I get some of that
healthy coke?"
871,MARK,871,It's the same Coke as before.
872,EXECUTIVE #4,872,"But this one is healthy! And it
tastes great!"
873,EXECUTIVE #1,873,Do you have any samples?
874,MARK,874,"Guys, it's the same Coke on the
inside. I've just changed the
outside."
875,EXECUTIVE #1,875,"Somehow by changing the outside,
he's also changed the inside!"
876,EXECUTIVE #2,876,"Oh, thank goodness. I've always
hated flying!"
877,EXECUTIVE #3,877,Me too!
878,EXECUTIVE #4,878,"What an invention! How did you do
it?"
879,MARK,879,"I didn't do anything, guys. I made
this on my computer last night. The
plane is exactly the same as it was
before."
880,EXECUTIVE #1,880,"That's the only plane I'll ever fly
on again!"
881,MARK,881,"That's the point here guys. With
these new advertising strategies,
people will buy your products with
abandon."
882,EXECUTIVE #2,882,"But it will take years to replace
all of our stock with these new
improved products you've invented."
883,MARK,883,"No. It won't. All you have to do is
print these words on the packaging.
That's it."
884,MARK,884,"Even if you don't understand it,
just start shipping these products
out to people as you see them here
and you're all going to get very,
very rich."
885,EXECUTIVE #3,885,How did you do it?
886,MARK,886,"Look, they're still the same
products you have on the shelves
right now. The only difference now
is that people won't get bummed out
or scared when they use them. Isn't
that a good thing?"
887,MARK,887,"Gentleman, if you'll excuse me, I
have five thousand gay orphans on
my front lawn that are going
bananas."
888,FAT MAN,888,"Thank the Man in the Sky for this.
I've never been happier in my life.
Now I can eat whatever I want,
whenever I want."
889,REPORTER,889,"Are you all right, sir?"
890,FAT MAN,890,"Yeah. I must just be real happy. It
says on the wrapper that they help
boost your happiness."
891,MARK,891,"You should slow down there, Greg."
892,GREG,892,Why's that?
893,MARK,893,"Just because the package says it's
not bad for you doesn't mean you
have to gorge yourself on it."
894,GREG,894,But it tastes so good.
895,MARK,895,That's just stupid.
896,GREG,896,No it's not.
897,GREG,897,See?
898,GREG,898,"You look sad. Here, have a brownie.
They'll cheer you up."
899,MARK,899,"I wish that worked for me, Greg."
900,GREG,900,What?
901,MARK,901,Nevermind. I'll see you around.
902,BUSINESS MAN,902,"I'm not talking to anyone on my
cell phone. But from a distance I
look very important and busy."
903,GIRLFRIEND,903,"No, I won't move into your mansion
with you when we die. You're really
smothering me."
904,BOYFRIEND,904,"The more you push me away, the more
attracted I am to you."
905,HONKING MAN,905,"Move it, fatty!"
906,HONKING MAN,906,Hey you're Mark Bellison!
907,MARK,907,"Yeah. So are you going to
apologize?"
908,HONKING MAN,908,For what?
909,MARK,909,"Nothing's really changed. I gave
people the Man in the Sky, made
myself rich and successful, told
the world they can eat whatever
they want and feel good about it.
Everyone's happy but me. Because
I'm the only one who knows it
all... isn't. I made it all up."
910,MARK,910,"You're not up there living in a
mansion. You're right here. In the
ground. That's all. And I'm the
only one who knows that."
911,MARK,911,"And the one thing I want I can't
have. Because the world is too
stupid to change. The world only
cares about what they can see, and
what they can know, and what
they're used to and what... makes
sense. No one listens to what they
really want. And that's why I'll
always just be a loser, grandma.
And that's why I'll always be
alone."
912,MARK,912,Who's there?
913,JENNIFER (O.S.),913,It's me. Can I come in?
914,MARK,914,Sure.
915,MARK,915,Haven't seen you much lately.
916,JENNIFER,916,"I know. I've been busy with work
and things. And I'm getting
married. That's why I came over.
To tell you."
917,MARK,917,Don't do it.
918,JENNIFER,918,The wedding is tomorrow.
919,JENNIFER,919,I hope you'll come.
920,MARK,920,No point really.
921,JENNIFER,921,"It would make me happy. Being
around you makes me happy."
922,MARK,922,So don't marry him.
923,JENNIFER,923,"I only have a few years to marry
someone with good genes and
financial stability so I can have
children and the family I've always
wanted. One day I'll be old and
wrinkly and ugly."
924,MARK,924,"No you won't. Not to me you won't.
I love you. If you really love
someone it doesn't matter what they
look like."
925,JENNIFER,925,What do you mean?
926,MARK,926,"Do me this favor. Just one favor.
Don't accept everything you see.
Don't just do something because
that's the way it's done."
927,JENNIFER,927,You're confusing me.
928,MARK,928,"Think about what you want. Find out
what you really want. And if it's
not the same as what I want, well
then I'll know that and I'll never
darken your doorstep again."
929,MARK,929,I want you. What do you want?
930,JENNIFER,930,I'm going to go.
931,MARK,931,"Please don't. Will you just stay a
little bit longer? I don't want to
be alone. Just sit with me."
932,JENNIFER,932,My invention.
933,GREG,933,We're gonna be late.
934,GREG,934,"Makes sense people would start
getting married at these places. I
mean, who you marry decides who's
mansion you're going to live in one
day. It's a big decision."
935,MARK,935,Yeah.
936,JENNIFER'S MOTHER,936,"It's time, dear."
937,JENNIFER'S MOTHER,937,Jennifer?
938,JENNIFER,938,I don't feel all right.
939,JENNIFER'S MOTHER,939,"What's wrong? Do you have food
poisoning?"
940,JENNIFER,940,"No. I don't think there's a word
for what I have."
941,WEDDING OVERSEER,941,"We are sitting here in this
building today to share in the
wedding of Rob and Jennifer. Two
young, attractive people who have
agreed that this union would be
mutually beneficial and that their
genetic match-up would most likely
produce favorable offspring and a
life of financial stability and
physical security."
942,WEDDING OVERSEER,942,"Rob, do you promise to stay with
Jennifer for as long as you want to
and to protect your offspring for
as long as you can?"
943,ROB,943,I do.
944,WEDDING OVERSEER,944,"Jennifer, do you promise to stay
with Rob for as long as you want to
and to protect your offspring for
as long as you can?"
945,WEDDING OVERSEER,945,Jennifer?
946,JENNIFER,946,"I'm sorry, hold on one second."
947,JENNIFER,947,"Rob, can I ask you something?"
948,ROB,948,Sure. But what are you doing?
949,JENNIFER,949,What color are my eyes?
950,ROB,950,I dunno...
951,ROB,951,"Oh, they're brown."
952,JENNIFER,952,"No Rob, they're blue."
953,ROB,953,"Oh, look at that. So they are.
You've got pretty blue eyes."
954,ROB,954,Can we get on with this?
955,WEDDING OVERSEER,955,"Jennifer, do you promise to stay
with Rob for as long as you want to
and to protect your offspring for
as long as you can?"
956,JENNIFER,956,I do.
957,WEDDING OVERSEER,957,"Before I pronounce these two man
and wife, is there anyone here who
thinks they'd offer either of these
people a better genetic match-up?"
958,MARK,958,Me.
959,ROB,959,"Oh come on. Look at you. You can't
be better."
960,MARK,960,Yes I can. You've got shmuck genes.
961,ROB,961,Schmuck genes? What's that?
962,MARK,962,And I love her.
963,MARK,963,"Jennifer, don't marry him. Is this
what you really want?"
964,JENNIFER,964,I don't know.
965,JENNIFER,965,Yes?
966,MARK,966,All right. I'm done. Goodbye.
967,ROB,967,"Are we married yet? Because I've
got plans this afternoon."
968,JENNIFER,968,Hold on a minute!
969,MARK,969,What?
970,JENNIFER,970,I'm confused.
971,MARK,971,So am I.
972,JENNIFER,972,"Is any of it... the things you
said... are they... I can't think
of the word."
973,JENNIFER,973,Is there a Man in the Sky?
974,MARK,974,No.
975,JENNIFER,975,Why'd you say there was?
976,MARK,976,"Because I couldn't cope with the
look on my grandmother's face."
977,JENNIFER,977,"But how could you say something
that... wasn't."
978,MARK,978,I'm not sure. I just did it.
979,JENNIFER,979,"And what did you mean that I could
grow old and ugly and still be
beautiful to you?"
980,MARK,980,"I mean just that. You'll always be
beautiful to me."
981,JENNIFER,981,But what if my looks...
982,MARK,982,It doesn't matter.
983,JENNIFER,983,I feel funny.
984,MARK,984,Me too.
985,MARK,985,"Everything is so hard. Nothing is
easy anymore."
986,JENNIFER,986,I know what I want.
987,MARK,987,What?
988,JENNIFER,988,"I want short, fat kids with little
snub noses."
989,MARK,989,Easy! That's an easy one.
990,JENNIFER,990,"Does anyone else know about your
invention?"
991,MARK,991,No. But I'm sure it won't be long.
992,JENNIFER,992,Should we tell them right away?
993,MARK,993,"I'm not sure. I don't think
everyone will understand."
994,GREG,994,"What's going on out here?
Everyone's just sitting in there.
Are we gonna finish this wedding?"
995,JENNIFER,995,Yes.
996,MARK,996,Praise the Man in the Sky.
997,NARRATOR,997,"The world's last moment of honesty.
A monumental occasion in the
history of mankind."
998,NARRATOR,998,"That lowly writer who stumbled upon
the ability to lie went on to
become one of the most important
men of his age, married to one of
the most beautiful women of his
time, and passed on the lying gene
to generations to come."
999,NARRATOR,999,"A world without honesty is a world
with dreams. A world with pretense.
A world with fiction. A world with
flattery. And most importantly, a
world with true love. Put simply, a
world very much like our own."
