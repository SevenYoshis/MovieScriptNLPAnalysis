0,MORTON,0,"Madman... Hideous spider... Run...
Run! Warn the President..."
1,MORTON,1,Noooooooo!!!!!
2,McGRATH,2,"And they says you scientists are
supposed to be smart."
3,SALOON GIRL (O.S.),3,"The legendary Captain James West
and I finally got him all to
myself."
4,WEST,4,"That's right, sugar, and you
should feel free to treat him
just bad."
5,WEST,5,"General McGrath's boys. I thought
y'all was never gonna show up."
6,SALOON GIRL,6,"Mister West, you wouldn't be here
workin' tonight, now would you?"
7,WEST,7,"No, no. 'Course not. Not tonight.
Would you be working if you were up
here with you?"
8,SALOON GIRL,8,Good.
9,DORA,9,"I'm sorry. That won't be
possible. I have... tonsillitis."
10,BIG REB,10,"Pack'er up good, Virgil.    Next stop
N'Orleans."
11,SALOON GIRL,11,Jim!
12,WEST,12,"Ah, this hole is a safety issue.
I'm thinking, what if it starts to
rain and the water level goes up.
It could suck you right up. I'm
protecting you. (variations)"
13,SALOON GIRL,13,Problem solved.
14,WEST,14,"Belle, you don't just ram a man's
underbritches into a knothole.
You wanna plug the hole, you ram
your own britches in there."
15,SALOON GIRL,15,"Oh, Jim."
16,WEST,16,"Much as I'd like to take credit
for that you might need to hand
me my gun..."
17,WEST,17,... Hand me my gun.
18,WEST,18,"Okay, who just made a wish?
Was it you?"
19,WEST,19,"I could sure use those clothes
now."
20,BIG REB,20,"Well, we got us a shy nig..."
21,WEST,21,"Fought five long years with the
Union Army not to hear that word
again. And you boys lost,
remember?"
22,WEST,22,How 'bout some pants!?
23,McGRATH,23,"I'm still waiting on my guns and
ammo, but I see my men have
brought your merchandise."
24,McGRATH,24,"I had expected to be delivering it
personally to Mr..."
25,HUDSON,25,"My employer, here in a brothel?"
26,HUDSON,26,That would be quite... redundant.
27,HUDSON,27,"You'll meet him when the time --
and place -- are appropriate.
Now..."
28,HUDSON,28,"... shall we go upstairs to check
the 'merchandise'?"
29,McGRATH,29,"Frankly, Mr. Hudson, I wasn't
planning to walk those oaken
stairs with you. Direct me to the
poot, sir. Something young and
creamy. A gamer that takes to the
crop and spur."
30,EYE-CROSSED REB,30,"You drive a hard bargain, lady.
All right, fifty cents to take
them big juicy lips and..."
31,DORA,31,Still not interested.
32,EYE-CROSSED REB,32,"But you gotta be interested.
You're a whore."
33,DORA,33,"That doesn't mean a girl can't
have high standards."
34,WEST,34,"Could I have a little privacy
here?"
35,WEST,35,Thank you.
36,WEST,36,"You'll have to excuse me,
darlin'... but my evidence is
getting away."
37,WEST,37,"Sorry about there not being any
towels."
38,McGRATH,38,"What's your name, missy?"
39,GORDON/DORA,39,"Dora. Would you like to go
upstairs?"
40,McGRATH,40,"Oh, indeedy I would."
41,EYE-CROSSED REB,41,"Hey, c'mere!   Who the hell are you
anyway?!"
42,McGRATH,42,She's... mine!
43,McGRATH,43,I feel like... a ditty!
44,GORDON/DORA,44,A ditty? But General...
45,GORDON/DORA,45,"... my talents really lay
elsewhere."
46,McGRATH,46,"Nothing stokes the fire in my
loins like a ditty."
47,McGRATH,47,"You've got some pretty fair lungs
on ya, girl, now use 'em!"
48,GORDON/DORA,48,"'Buy a drink for the boys
In the backroom for me...'"
49,WEST,49,"Backwards-ass bumpkins got a wagon
full of nitro...!"
50,GORDON/DORA,50,"'And tell them I tried...
And tell them I cried...'"
51,WEST,51,Whoa now...!
52,WEST,52,"I said, whoa!!!"
53,WEST,53,"Well, well, this is workin' out to
be a perfect day. My man..."
54,WEST (O.S.),54,... General Bloodbath McGrath.
55,GORDON/CROWD,55,"And tell them I tried just the
same...!"
56,GORDON/DORA,56,"Well, that's a new one."
57,McGRATH,57,"Don't let the ear scare you.    I
lost it at Chickamauga."
58,GORDON/DORA,58,"Oh really. One can hardly
notice..."
59,GORDON/DORA,59,"Would you mind...? I... I...
can't seem to release the clasp of
my belt."
60,McGRATH,60,Wha... what's this?
61,GORDON/DORA,61,"It's a deep, deep pool. Maybe
your old swimmin' hole. Getting
sleepy, General?"
62,McGRATH,62,"Yes, I'm sleepy."
63,GORDON,63,"Good. You're going to be my
little doggy. And when I say
'speak,' you tell me everything I
want to know. Understood?"
64,McGRATH,64,Woof!
65,GORDON,65,"All right, little doggy. Sit up."
66,GORDON,66,"Now tell me who's in the sack next
door. Is it the scientist, Dr.
Escobar? Speak!"
67,McGRATH,67,Woof!   Woof!
68,GORDON,68,"Speak words, dumb doggy! Tell me
the name of the man you kidnapped
him for..."
69,GORDON,69,"Watch the swirling spiral!   Lie
down, bad dog!"
70,WEST,70,"Didn't mean to startle you, ma'am.
Looked like you could use some
help."
71,GORDON,71,"Looks can be deceivin'... dark
stranger. I am perfectly fine."
72,WEST,72,"I can see that, darlin'. Woman of
your caliber probably gets top
dollar, too. So here you go."
73,WEST,73,"You can run along. I'll take care
of McGrath."
74,GORDON/DORA,74,No!   I need him!
75,WEST,75,"C'mon, lady. You got the money.
Have a little dignity."
76,McGRATH,76,West...!!!
77,HUDSON,77,Get Escobar out of here!
78,GORDON (O.S.),78,Leave him right there.
79,GORDON,79,"Let's go, Hudson... hands!"
80,GORDON,80,Thank... you.
81,WEST,81,"U.S. Army... Now get outta my
way, lady!"
82,GORDON,82,"I'm no lady! I'm a U.S. Marshal!
You get out of my way!"
83,LIPPENREIDER,83,"Get out of my way... get out of my
way... U.S. Army... U.S. Marshal."
84,LOVELESS,84,"Oh, dear..."
85,HUDSON,85,"Federal agents inside, sir!"
86,LOVELESS,86,So Miss Lippenreider informs me.
87,LOVELESS,87,"Still, I believe good manners
dictate we should send out..."
88,LOVELESS,88,... the welcome wagon.
89,WEST,89,So now what...?
90,HOUSE DETECTIVE,90,"Whoa there, 'pardner.'"
91,HOUSE DETECTIVE,91,"Winning the war may have got you
forty acres and a mule, but you
can't just traipse into the
President's office. Now gimme
that gun."
92,WEST,92,This gun?
93,WEST,93,Or this one?
94,PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.),94,Gentlemen!
95,PRESIDENT GRANT,95,"Don't make Captain West any later
for his appointment than he
already is!"
96,PRESIDENT GRANT,96,"Been a lot of death threats lately
... Cabinet made me hire some damn
detectives."
97,PRESIDENT GRANT,97,"Drink, cigar?"
98,WEST,98,"Thank you, sir."
99,PRESIDENT GRANT,99,"I hear you let General McGrath
get away?"
100,WEST,100,"Sir, I had him right in my hands
when some half-a-sissy wearin' a
dress ruined..."
101,PRESIDENT GRANT,101,Artemus Gordon.
102,WEST,102,You... know him?
103,PRESIDENT GRANT,103,"Of course I know him, he's the
best marshal I've got! He's a
genius."
104,PRESIDENT GRANT,104,"Gordon has proven himself time and
again as a very cunning operator
with a rapacious intellect.
Nothing will stop him from
completing a mission for his
President... except the impulsive
actions of a headstrong cowboy!"
105,WEST,105,Who are you?
106,PRESIDENT GRANT,106,"I am the President of the United
States!"
107,WEST,107,Wrong answer.    Who are you?
108,PRESIDENT GRANT,108,I am the President of...
109,PRESIDENT GRANT,109,... I'm Artemus Gordon.
110,WEST,110,"The President went to West Point
... not Harvard."
111,PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.),111,"Will somebody tell me what the
hell this stunt is all about!?!"
112,GORDON,112,"Sir, in perilous times like these,
I was simply illustrating how
someone impersonating you could
actually walk right into the very
bowels of the White House..."
113,PRESIDENT GRANT,113,"You're clever, Gordon. One day
it'll get you killed."
114,PRESIDENT GRANT,114,"... And you, West -- not every
situation calls for your patented
approach of shoot first, shoot
later, shoot again -- then when
they're all dead, try to ask a
question or two."
115,PRESIDENT GRANT,115,"Working together will be good for
both of you."
116,WEST AND GORDON,116,"But, sir, I work..."
117,PRESIDENT GRANT,117,"You work the way your Commander In
Chief tells you to work."
118,PRESIDENT GRANT,118,"Ten of our country's best
scientists... all kidnapped in the
last year. By General McGrath, it
now seems."
119,PRESIDENT GRANT,119,"The fact is, gentlemen, you've
both been working on the same
case all along. Why did it take
you so long to realize it?"
120,WEST,120,"Well, sir, one of us was still
trying to figure out if he was a
man or a woman."
121,PRESIDENT GRANT,121,"I don't have time for this
bickering! One week, if we're to
believe this..."
122,PRESIDENT GRANT,122,"'General Grant, the scientists
that you seek are in my employ --"
123,PRESIDENT GRANT (CONT'D),123,"-- Creating a weapons system
beyond the pale of contemporary
imagination. History and justice
are on my side. I suggest you put
your affairs in order. You have
one week before you will surrender
the U.S. Government.'"
124,PRESIDENT GRANT,124,"This letter was delivered inside
this."
125,GORDON,125,"Marzipan, isn't it?"
126,PRESIDENT GRANT,126,Wait!
127,WEST,127,"It's McGrath, sir. The South is
rising again. I'm gonna stop it."
128,GORDON,128,"Sir, West's obsession aside,
McGrath may be a vicious killer,
but a mastermind he is not. So
whom do we seek? After consulting
with Intelligence..."
129,WEST,129,"McGrath's headed for New Orleans.
The longer we stand here talkin',
the farther away he gets. I don't
need 'Intelligence' to tell me
that."
130,GORDON,130,"Ah, so that would mean you rely on
... Stupidity?"
131,PRESIDENT GRANT,131,"Gentlemen! I'm leaving today for
Utah where the transcontinental
railroads will be joined at
Promontory Point."
132,PRESIDENT GRANT,132,"For the first time the United
States will truly be united."
133,PRESIDENT GRANT,133,"Someone wants us divided. Now
look, you two are the best I've
got. Put aside your differences
and stop this madman... whoever he
is. If you fail, well... we may
never know how great this country
could've been."
134,PRESIDENT GRANT,134,You have a week. Dismissed!
135,AIDE,135,"The President has put a private
train at your disposal. Engine
number five, track six."
136,AIDE,136,"Mr. Gordon, the item you
requested."
137,WEST,137,Figures.
138,GORDON,138,"I call it the Bi-axle Nitro-
Combust..."
139,WEST,139,"Save it.   I've gotta train to
catch."
140,WEST,140,Yee-haaa!!
141,GORDON,141,Avant!!!
142,WEST,142,Stop this train!! You hear me!?!
143,GORDON,143,Thanks for dropping in.
144,WEST,144,"Forget the bikes, the beards, the
fake boobies. Put down the
needlepoint and let's settle
this like men!"
145,GORDON,145,"As a matter of clarification, this
isn't needlepoint. This is."
146,GORDON,146,"Right now, I'm putting the final
touches on a new invention of my
creation. I call it... The
Impermeable. It's a vest that,
when worn under the clothing, can
stop any modern bullet fired even
at close range."
147,WEST,147,Really?
148,GORDON,148,"But it hasn't been really
tested empirically yet."
149,WEST,149,Get up!
150,GORDON,150,"Guns. I find them so primitive
and unnecessary... if one has done
one's proper planning."
151,WEST,151,"Yeah?   How do you feel about a
fist?"
152,GORDON,152,"I must tell you, Mr. West, I've
always felt that allowing a
situation to degenerate into
physical violence is a failure on
my part."
153,WEST,153,"Well then, 'Mr.' Gordon, you
failed."
154,GORDON,154,"I'm sorry, Mr. West, you brought
this on yourself."
155,GORDON,155,I love this train!
156,GORDON,156,"The President asked for my
suggestions on how to make the
Wanderer both comfortable and
functional..."
157,GORDON,157,"And while you're down there,
you may want to avail yourself
of my Sub-carriage Inter-rail
Egressor..."
158,WEST,158,"Only one doin' any 'egressin'
is gonna be you."
159,GORDON,159,"Perhaps the President was right
about us putting aside our petty
differences."
160,GORDON,160,"'The opposite is beneficial, from
things that differ comes the
fairest attunement.' Aristotle."
161,COLEMAN,161,"Knock each other about all ya
please, but harm my train and
I'll douse ya like dogs."
162,GORDON,162,That's my veal reduction sauce!
163,COLEMAN,163,"Well then, let's get on about our
business, shall we, gentlemen?
Now, where to?"
164,WEST,164,New Orleans.
165,GORDON,165,"Shall we let Professor Morton
decide?"
166,WEST,166,Who?
167,GORDON,167,"Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton,
expert in the field of metallurgy
... discovered in a field of
alfalfa. Kidnapped from M.I.T.
six months ago."
168,WEST,168,That's a man's head!
169,GORDON,169,"... And this magnetic collar was
around it when his body was
discovered. Haven't figured that
one out yet..."
170,WEST,170,That's a man's head.
171,GORDON,171,"According to the Retinal Terminus
Theory... a dying person's last
conscious image is burned into the
back of the eyeball like a
photograph.   Perhaps there's a
clue there..."
172,GORDON,172,Morton's last image!
173,WEST,173,That's a man's head!
174,GORDON,174,"Ah. The refraction of the lenses
causes the image to appear upside
down. We simply..."
175,WEST,175,"It's McGrath.    I was right all
along."
176,GORDON,176,"He seems to have something in his
pocket... too fuzzy to read,
though..."
177,GORDON,177,"Mortification of the aqueous humor
seems to have led to the loss
of..."
178,WEST,178,... glasses.
179,WEST,179,"'Friends of the South! Come to
a Surprise Costume Ball. April
14, eight-thirty. 346 Garden
Street... '"
180,WEST,180,Like I said.... New Orleans.
181,GORDON (V.O.),181,"How about this? You could come
as my man servant?"
182,GORDON,182,"How about this? You could come
as my man servant."
183,WEST,183,"Oh yes, Massa Gordon, dats what
I'll do. And I'll jus' smile
and do as I's tole so those
people won' ever know that I
would rather shoot myself in
the head than play your god
damned man servant!"
184,GORDON,184,I have a horse costume.
185,GORDON,185,You could be the head.
186,WEST,186,"The only thing I need to wear is
this."
187,GORDON,187,"Okay, if you insist on carrying a
firearm, I have something I think
you'll find intriguing..."
188,GORDON,188,And it would go nicely with this...
189,WEST,189,Jim West does not wear a dress.
190,GORDON,190,Then what's your plan?
191,WEST,191,"How 'bout this: I'll go as a
government agent who's gonna
kill McGrath."
192,GORDON,192,"An armed, Negro cowboy costume,
how creative. In a room full of
white Southerners, you oughtta
fit right in. You might even win
first prize!"
193,GORDON,193,"Listen to me. The art of disguise
is what's going to get us into
that party, thus allowing us to
find these kidnapped scientists
before they're forced to create
something that will destroy this
great country."
194,GORDON (CONT'D),194,"Now you and I are the chosen ones,
Jim. We're under direct orders
from the President himself. And
our mission is clear: Save our
country. Our freedom is at stake
and this is our duty as men. Now,
you go as a riverboat captain and
I'll be a saloon girl."
195,WEST,195,"Let me tell you a little something
about beloved 'art of disguise'...
That night at Fat-Can's, I knew you
weren't a woman."
196,GORDON,196,"But I was propositioned by three
men."
197,WEST,197,"Gordon, you looked nasty. Your
breasts were all hard and stiff,
and were sticking straight out
like two rusty cannons on a
sunken ship."
198,GORDON,198,"These are a work of art.
Scientifically and aesthetically
perfect."
199,WEST,199,They look like shit.
200,GORDON,200,Touch them.
201,WEST,201,"I don't wanna touch 'em.   I can
see I don't like 'em."
202,GORDON,202,"What, are you afraid you're
wrong? Touch my breasts."
203,COLEMAN,203,"I knew it. Well, I'll have no
part of it!"
204,WEST,204,"There, Gordon, you happy?
I'm touching your breasts."
205,GORDON,205,"Not so rough.    The buckwheat'll
come out."
206,WEST,206,Buckwheat?   That's your problem.
207,GORDON,207,What are you doing?
208,WEST,208,"Now, squeeze this. This is what a
breast should feel like."
209,GORDON,209,Whoa...
210,WEST,210,Isn't that nice?
211,GORDON,211,Very nice.
212,WEST,212,Now touch yourself.
213,GORDON,213,You win.   I'm hard.
214,COLEMAN,214,"Federal officers, bah!"
215,GORDON,215,"I was just going to jot down a
thought."
216,WEST,216,"You know something, that's a good
place to put a gun."
217,GORDON,217,"But then, where would I keep my
notepad."
218,WEST,218,"You know, Artemus, I think you
underestimate the convenience of a
pocket."
219,GUARD,219,"You got about as much chance of
havin' an invitation as him."
220,WEST,220,"Matter of fact, got it right here."
221,WOMAN (O.S.),221,Hey... get your hands off me!
222,RITA,222,"Put me in the dungeon with all
those smelly, dirty bearded men
... but I am not goin' in there."
223,AMAZONIA,223,You applied for the position.
224,RITA,224,"Yeah, a standing up position.   I'm
an entertainer, not a..."
225,MISS LIPPENREIDER,225,"Do not be selfish and stupid. He
always spoils his new girl."
226,RITA,226,"Yeah. Well gimme a simple diamond
bracelet instead of that..."
227,MUNITIA,227,"It is not so bad... once the metal
warms up."
228,SULTRY WOMAN (O.S.),228,"An authentic cowboy outfit...
complete with six-guns!"
229,DRAGON LADY,229,"What a terribly clever costume,
Mr...?"
230,WEST,230,... West.   Jim West.
231,DRAGON LADY,231,"Well... West meets East. Mae Lee
East."
232,DRAGON LADY,232,"Are you here alone, Mr. West?"
233,WEST,233,"Actually I'm, uh trying to
surprise an old friend -- General
McGrath. Seen him around
anywhere?"
234,MISS EAST (DRAGON LADY),234,"I don't believe that name was on
our guest list. And I would know.
I'm Dr. Loveless's personal
assistant."
235,WEST,235,"Dr. Arliss Loveless...? One of
the great founders of the
Confederacy with Jefferson Davis.
Funny how most people think he's
dead."
236,MISS EAST,236,Tonight's his coming-out party.
237,MISS EAST,237,See anybody that looks familiar?
238,WEST,238,"Matter of fact, I do."
239,MISS EAST,239,I'm... jealous.
240,MISS EAST,240,Meet me later... in the foyer.
241,DISTAFF CORPS,241,"'Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord...'"
242,DISTAFF CORPS,242,"'He has trampled down the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are
stored!'"
243,LOVELESS,243,Don't you just hate that song?
244,LOVELESS,244,"Why, y'all look like you've seen a
ghost! It's me, dear friends,
alive and kicking! Well, alive,
anyway..."
245,LOVELESS,245,"We may've lost the war, but heaven
knows... we haven't lost our sense
of humor!"
246,LOVELESS,246,"Not even when we've lost a lung...
a spleen... a bladder... two
legs... thirty-five feet of small
intestine and our ability to
reproduce..."
247,LOVELESS,247,All in the name of the South...
248,LOVELESS,248,... do we lose our sense of humor.
249,LOVELESS,249,"I owe a deep debt of gratitude to
my friends across the sea for
their comfort and... succor."
250,LOVELESS,250,"So...! Mi casa es su casa! Ma
maison est a vous! Let the party
begin!!!"
251,LOVELESS,251,"Mr. West, how nice of you to join
us tonight... and add color to
these monochromatic proceedings."
252,WEST,252,"Well, when a man comes back from
the dead, it's an occasion to
stand and be counted."
253,LOVELESS,253,"Miss East informs me that you were
expecting to meet General McGrath
here. I knew him years ago... but
haven't seen him in a coon's age."
254,WEST,254,"I bet a man like yourself would
find it difficult to keep in touch
with even half the people you
know."
255,LOVELESS,255,"Perhaps the lovely Miss East will
keep you from being a slave to
your disappointment."
256,WEST,256,"Well, you know beautiful women...
they encourage you one second, cut
the legs out from under you the
next."
257,WEST,257,"Hey, honey... I see a big ole
spider up on the wall. Hope it
doesn't drop down your pretty
dress."
258,GORDON,258,"Peeking through the keyhole...?
So 18th Century."
259,McGRATH,259,"Dr. Loveless, my men are ready to
go to war with no weapons to
fight. Ever since the nitro and
the guns were destroyed at Fat-
Can's, lice and demoralization
have set in!"
260,LOVELESS,260,"Your men will have their weapons
tonight. And my promise that they
will be part of the greatest
military victory of this century!"
261,McGRATH,261,"Oh, you're a pip, sir! I'd follow
you into the maw of Cerberus
himself!"
262,LOVELESS,262,And so you shall.
263,LOVELESS,263,"Have your men here at... 10
o'clock tonight."
264,MISS EAST,264,I said to meet me in the foyer.
265,WEST,265,"Oh, the foy-aay. Sorry, I've
never been much good at French."
266,MISS EAST,266,Au contraire...
267,MISS EAST,267,"So let's see, Mr. West... are you
a dangerous spy of some sort? Or
just a handsome cowboy who likes
to... poke around."
268,WEST,268,Um... that second one.
269,GORDON,269,"Howdy there... big sturdy gal.
Yer dance card full?"
270,WEST,270,"Thanks for helpin' me get to the
bottom of this case."
271,WEST,271,"Real impressed the way you got the
dance floor staked out. Maybe one
of your missin' scientists'll cut
in."
272,WEST,272,"Thought you should know that while
you were trying to decide what
shoes to wear tonight..."
273,WEST,273,"I found that our host, Dr.
Loveless..."
274,WEST,274,"... is meeting McGrath and his
troops at Malheureux Point in an
hour."
275,WEST,275,"So you enjoy the party. I'm gonna
go save the Republic."
276,WEST,276,"But I will say, good work on your
bladders tonight... they're damn
perky."
277,GORDON/MOUNTAIN MAN,277,Hang him!
278,GEORGE WASHINGTON,278,"Looks like we're gonna have to
teach y'all a little lesson on how
to behave in polite society."
279,WEST,279,"Don't grab a white lady's boobies
at the big redneck dance. Is that
the lesson? Well, I learned it.
Don't scratch your head with the
shrimp fork. I got that one too.
So whaddaya say we call this off?"
280,GORDON,280,"I feel as if we know each other
from someplace...?"
281,RITA,281,"Try again, buster...!"
282,GORDON,282,"Ma'am, please! While I realize I
look like something straight out
of James Fenimore Cooper... I mean
you no harm. My name is Artemus
Gordon. And you look like you're
in trouble."
283,"RITA
(dryly)",283,Really?
284,RITA,284,"I'm Rita. I was hired here as an
entertainer. Not that I'm
complaining, but what are you
doin' in here?"
285,GORDON,285,"Looking for some missing
scientists... not that I'm
complaining."
286,GORDON,286,"I'm a special U.S. Marshal on
assignment from the President."
287,RITA,287,"If you're so special, how come
you're lookin' up here when
Loveless has 'em all workin' down
in the dungeon?"
288,RITA,288,"Get me out of here and I'll take
you down there."
289,GORDON,289,"Too late. The 'dungeon' is
cleaned out. It was the first
place I checked, right after I
sampled the gumbo. Bit heavy on
the okra."
290,RITA,290,"Thank you... Artemus, was it?"
291,GORDON,291,"One doesn't forget a smile like
that. Now where in the world was
it...? Have you ever played the
Empire Room... the Bijou Cafe
perhaps...?"
292,WEST,292,"Can I have everyone's attention
please. I think we've had a
series of major misunderstandings
and I'd like to take a moment to
clear them up. First, the whole
drumming on the boobies thing.
In my native land, Africa, my
ancestors used drums to
communicate between villages. I'm
sure y'all can see that this young
girl here can communicate all the
way down to Baton Rouge. Hell, on
a clear day, we might even get
Galveston. All I was saying was,
'How're you doing,' 'My name's Jim,'
'How's your mama?'"
293,WEST (CONT'D),293,"Second misunderstanding. That
redneck comment. I'm getting the
sense that some of you took that
negatively. You know, some of my
best friends are whiskey-guzzling,
pot-bellied rednecks just like
y'all here."
294,WEST (CONT'D),294,"That slavery thing, I don't see
what the big deal was. Hell, who
wouldn't want somebody to run
around for them doing chores. Are
you going to get your big, fat,
lazy ass out of bed every morning
and pick your own damn cotton.
I don't think so."
295,WEST (CONT'D),295,"Let's head on inside and knock back
some shine. Come on, back inside.
No. Okay."
296,WEST (CONT'D),296,"I stand before you as a man who
realizes he has done something
wrong and I am prepared to do the
right thing. Will you marry me?"
297,WEST,297,"I'll take that as a no. Darling,
would it help at all if I said I
thought you were a man?"
298,WEST,298,Guess not.
299,GEORGE WASHINGTON,299,Hang him!
300,GORDON (O.S.),300,Hey-yaa!!!
301,WEST,301,Hang 'm...!
302,WEST,302,Hang'm!?!
303,GORDON,303,"Meet my trigger-happy partner,
James West... who doesn't seem to
realize that my carefully planned
diversion gave me the opportunity
to search for the missing
scientists."
304,WEST,304,"Scientist, huh."
305,GORDON,305,"This is Rita. I found her locked
in a cage in Loveless's bedroom.
She's an entertainer."
306,RITA,306,"Um, maybe I haven't been quite
honest about that... My name is
Rita Escobar. I came to find
Guillermo Escobar, the scientist,
my... father."
307,GORDON,307,"Professor Escobar?! He was the
one I almost rescued that night
when..."
308,GORDON,308,"That's where I know you from!
Fat-Can Candy's... you sang before
I did."
309,RITA,309,Excuse me?
310,GORDON,310,"That was me. Burgundy dress with
the bustle..."
311,WEST,311,"Look, Rita, I'm sorry you had the
wrong agent working on your case.
When I find your father I promise
I'll send him back safely..."
312,RITA,312,"He's impulsive, James."
313,LOVELESS,313,"Well, General, it's been a long
journey from New Liberty."
314,McGRATH,314,"Sir, there isn't a day that passes
that I don't contemplate it."
315,LOVELESS,315,"Yes, and so do I. So do I."
316,LOVELESS,316,"If I'd only had the scientific
understanding of gunpowder and
primers that I have today..."
317,McGRATH,317,That's not what I meant.
318,LOVELESS,318,"Oh, you mean the stomach-churning
carnage that earned you your
unfortunate nom de guerre..."
319,LOVELESS,319,What was that nickname again?
320,McGRATH,320,"'Bloodbath' McGrath... the Butcher
of New Liberty.'"
321,REB #1,321,They oughta be here by now.
322,REB #2,322,Maybe we're in the wrong place.
323,REB #1,323,"No, we're supposed to wait 'xactly
on this here spot."
324,McGRATH,324,"Why you sawed-off sadistic
bastard! You've betrayed us!"
325,LOVELESS,325,"My dear General, after donating
half my physical being creating a
weapon capable of doing this...
how did you and General Lee repay
my loyalty? You surrendered at
Appomattox! So, who betrayed whom?"
326,LOVELESS,326,"Munitia, make note. Turret speed
needs to be accelerated!"
327,MUNITIA,327,Change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8!
328,AMAZONIA,328,"A bucket for the minister, please!"
329,LIPPENREIDER,329,"Scream. Scream. My head. I'm
dying. Scream. Moan. Scream."
330,McGRATH,330,"Loveless, I demand you give the
order to stop this slaughter now!"
331,LOVELESS,331,"... We're going to need more
loading drills! I'm hearing too
much time between screams."
332,McGRATH,332,"For the last time, give them the
order to desist!"
333,LOVELESS,333,"General, I understand your
distress. But believe me, those
men are not dying senselessly. It
is for a far greater cause than
you can imagine."
334,McGRATH,334,"Go straight to hell, sir!"
335,LOVELESS,335,After you... sir.
336,LOVELESS,336,Bloodbath McGrath indeed.
337,LOVELESS,337,"Well, that concludes the
festivities. Ladies, feed him to
the crabs."
338,LOVELESS,338,"But, my friends, that tank is just
a little ol' toy compared to what
this country's greatest scientists
are cooking up for me next. So if
I've piqued your interest, bring
1000 kilograms of your country's
gold to Spider Canyon four days
from now."
339,LOVELESS,339,"Now if you'll excuse me, I've got
a tank to catch."
340,LOVELESS,340,"My destination is both the
future... and the past! Forget
Paul Revere, this will be the most
revolutionary ride in the history
of America!!"
341,LOVELESS,341,"If you don't want to miss the
ride, have the last payment of
1000 kilograms of your country's
gold in my hands no later than
Friday. That's when I make our
little proposal to President
Grant. One I'm ever so confident
he's gonna accept."
342,LOVELESS,342,"Au revoir, adios, and ta-ta!"
343,GORDON,343,"It came up out of the lake...
from the way these corpses are
positioned, laid down a 360-degree
pattern of cannon fire... then
disappeared in moments."
344,GORDON,344,"My God, what kind of weapon is it?"
345,RITA,345,"Excuse me, I think I'm going to be
sick."
346,WEST,346,"It just rolls on and on. Makes a
screeching sound -- like a wounded
animal. Got a 'cabin' on top with
a cannon... swivels 'round like an
eagle's head."
347,GORDON,347,You saw it?
348,WEST,348,"Heard about it. Thought it was
crazy survivors' stories."
349,GORDON,349,"What survivors? There aren't any
here."
350,WEST,350,"New Liberty, Illinois -- the free
slave town just over the border.
Just one week before the War ended
in '65. I was in the 9th Cavalry
that discovered it. Old men,
women, children... they used them
for target practice..."
351,WEST,351,"That's when I vowed to follow
McGrath to the end of the earth."
352,McGRATH,352,"What's the matter, West? Thought
you'd be happy to find me... like
this."
353,WEST,353,I was hoping to kill you myself.
354,RITA,354,"That's a nice way to talk to
people."
355,McGRATH,355,"You'll have to live with it... As
I've lived with the blame for New
Liberty."
356,WEST,356,What do you mean?
357,McGRATH,357,"It was Loveless... his plan. He
operated the killing machine
there. Smarter now... left it to
others here."
358,WEST,358,Where is he?   Where did he go?!
359,RITA (O.S.),359,"Well, I know that."
360,RITA,360,"I'll tell you if you take me
along."
361,WEST,361,Just tell me.
362,RITA,362,"The girls at the mansion. They
talk."
363,RITA,363,"'I vonder if my hair vill get
frissy in ze desert...? Vhere is
diss Ooo-tah anyvay?'"
364,WEST/GORDON,364,Ooo-tah?!
365,WEST,365,"Coleman... let's go!    Full speed
ahead!"
366,COLEMAN,366,"Aye, sir!"
367,GORDON,367,"I don't see why we couldn't have
given her a ride back home to
Texas. It is on the way..."
368,WEST,368,"On the way to Utah where our
President happens to be. Maybe we
oughta be worryin' about that
little coincidence!"
369,GORDON,369,"We wouldn't have known where
Loveless was going if it wasn't
for her. Seems a bit ungracious.
Possibly perilous."
370,WEST,370,"Look, all that would happen would
be she'd get in our way and I'd
probably wind up gettin' in the
saddle with her."
371,GORDON,371,"Funny that you say that. Because
I thought she was more interested
in me."
372,GORDON (O.S.),372,"You know, I've been trying to
place myself in Loveless's
shoes..."
373,WEST,373,Good luck on that one.
374,GORDON,374,"Ha, ha, ha... You know, I can't
imagine what Loveless -- a man
without any reproductive organs
could possibly want with Rita."
375,GORDON (O.S.),375,"Not that Rita doesn't have a
figure that would inspire a
Botticelli... or a Raphael."
376,GORDON,376,"... especially her breasts. Did
you notice the way one of them..."
377,GORDON,377,"Both of them actually... to say
nothing of her buttocks..."
378,GORDON,378,"... and the group of foreign
ministers at Loveless's party...
What were they doing there?"
379,GORDON,379,"Here's France, Spain and
Britain..."
380,GORDON,380,How long has she been here?
381,WEST,381,Since the first breast.
382,GORDON,382,I am so embarrassed.
383,WEST,383,I'll spare you.
384,WEST,384,"Make yourself a sandwich to take
with you. You're getting off."
385,RITA,385,But... I can help you.
386,WEST,386,How could you possibly help us?
387,RITA,387,"Well, I heard you talking about
why all those foreign guys were
at Loveless's party...? You
want me to tell you?"
388,GORDON,388,By all means.
389,RITA,389,"This is fantastic. You can cut it
with a fork! How'd you cook it?"
390,GORDON,390,"Well, in a daubiere... a clay pot.
A French method which..."
391,WEST,391,What about the foreign guys?!
392,RITA,392,"They were mad about something,
you know? Something about a
real bad deal in Louisiana on
purpose."
393,GORDON,393,The Louisiana Purchase?
394,RITA,394,"And Queen somebody-somebody of
France got swindled."
395,GORDON,395,Queen Isabella of Spain.
396,WEST,396,"Gordon, this is crazy. She
doesn't know what she's talking
about!"
397,WEST,397,"Coleman, stop the train! Miss
Escobar's getting off."
398,COLEMAN (V.O.),398,Who the hell's Miss Escobar?
399,RITA,399,"I'm a frightened, starving, half-
naked young woman who only wants
to find her father!"
400,COLEMAN (V.O.),400,Half-naked?
401,WEST,401,Coleman... stop the train.
402,COLEMAN (V.O.),402,"We're not puttin' anybody off.
Not out here in the middle of
nowhere."
403,RITA,403,"Please, Jim. My father's the only
family I've got. What am I
supposed to do? Sit home and wait
for news he's been killed? Or go
do something! What would you do,
Jim?!"
404,WEST,404,"Look, I got nothing against you,
Rita. It's just that... What's
going to happen when we catch up
to Loveless... with you on the
train?"
405,RITA,405,"I know you'd never let him take me
back. I've seen you shoot."
406,GORDON,406,"I assure you, Rita, an attack by
Loveless would be an exercise in
futility."
407,GORDON,407,"... Allow me to demonstrate how my
design suggestions have made the
Wanderer impervious to attack."
408,WEST,408,I'm the impervious part.
409,GORDON,409,"Hardly. Completely armor-
plated..."
410,GORDON,410,"An attacker would find the
lighting inside extremely...
unflattering."
411,GORDON,411,"And if, by some inconceivable
fluke, they did manage to gain
entrance..."
412,GORDON,412,"An innocent billiard ball this
way."
413,GORDON,413,"But depress the number... a
sleeping gas bomb. Effective in
under three seconds."
414,GORDON,414,"So rest assured, Rita... you are
completely safe within these
walls."
415,WEST,415,"I don't know about you, ma'am, but
I know I'll be sleeping a whole
lot better tonight..."
416,WEST,416,"... assuming Loveless barges in
here and feels like a game of
pool."
417,RITA,417,"Speaking of sleeping, I'm pretty
tired. Artemus, do you think I
could borrow something to wear?"
418,WEST,418,"I've got somethin' you might use.
It ain't stylish, but it's
practical..."
419,WEST,419,"Loveless kidnapped two chemists,
that means there's gonna be
explosives. He's got a metallurgist,
so there's gonna be heavy armor.
And he's got Rita's father, who --
according to you -- is the world's
foremost specialist in hydraulics.
Which means, whatever it is... it's
gonna move."
420,WEST,420,"So what, is he building that's
gonna make the President fall to
his knees and surrender the country?"
421,GORDON,421,A bedside heater.
422,WEST,422,What?
423,GORDON,423,"Rita. She    needs a bedside heater.
I mean, it   gets cold in there, you
know, with   the stained glass window
right over   the --"
424,GORDON,424,"Such a pleasant girl.   A real
breath of fresh ass."
425,WEST,425,You said ass.
426,GORDON,426,Did I?   No...
427,COLEMAN (V.O.),427,"We have Loveless, gentlemen!
Seven hundred yards and closing!"
428,RITA,428,What's going on?
429,GORDON,429,"Stay back here, take cover!"
430,WEST,430,What the hell is this?
431,GORDON,431,"I took the liberty of installing
it while you were sleeping."
432,WEST,432,Leave my stuff alone!
433,COLEMAN,433,Am I missin' somethin' here...?
434,LOVELESS,434,"Amazonia, shall we disabuse our
friends of the notion that one's
problems are solved when we see
the light at the end of the
tunnel!"
435,GORDON,435,"Jim, we're the ones chasing
Loveless, correct?"
436,GORDON,436,"Then perhaps you could explain
what they're doing behind us."
437,WEST,437,"They couldn't fire the cannon at
us from in front. Any other
questions?"
438,WEST,438,"Would it put you out too much to
throw me a rope and hit your
little secret button?"
439,GORDON,439,I taught him how it worked.
440,RITA,440,"You know you could put a gun on
that thing."
441,MUNITIA,441,"I have them square in my sights,
sire."
442,LOVELESS,442,"As do I, Munitia... as do I."
443,LOVELESS,443,Fire away!
444,LOVELESS,444,Close the fire door!
445,RITA,445,"I won't let Loveless take me
again! I'd rather be dead!"
446,GORDON,446,That's not a good one to wish for.
447,RITA,447,"Please, Artemus, don't leave me
alone!"
448,WEST (O.S.),448,"It's me, Jim. Open up!"
449,RITA,449,"It's a trick, I know Loveless."
450,GORDON,450,"Rita, no!   It's just..."
451,WEST,451,"Too damn late, is what it is."
452,WEST,452,"An innocent billiard ball this
way, but depress the number and on
impact... a sleeping-gas bomb."
453,GORDON,453,Don't move!
454,LOVELESS,454,"Continue, Miss Lippenreider..."
455,MISS LIPPENREIDER,455,"West. Let go of my leg! Gordon.
Listen to me. Loveless collared
us with the same metal device we
found on Morton."
456,LOVELESS,456,"Oh, Munitia... I hope we're not
going to leave evidence behind
like we did last time."
457,MUNITIA,457,"Nitro this time, sire."
458,LOVELESS,458,"Good morning, gentlemen! I trust
you slept well."
459,GORDON,459,What have you done with Rita?
460,LOVELESS,460,"Rita, is it? How familiar! Rita
is sleeping off the after-effects
in the stateroom."
461,LOVELESS,461,"Quite lovely, isn't she? Who
knows... I might even become
'familiar' with her myself."
462,WEST,462,"And that would become one more
reason why I'm going to kill you."
463,LOVELESS,463,"Yes, Mr. West, I'm sure a well-
endowed blackamoor like yourself
must find it absolutely
impossible... that a freak like me
could fully enjoy the pleasure of
a woman. But having witnessed my
use of mechinology so far...
wouldn't you think I could provide
myself with something for the
lower half of my body that was
hard-pumping and indefatigably
steely?"
464,LOVELESS,464,"... And speaking of 'hard
pumping...' Mr. Coleman, full
steam ahead!"
465,LOVELESS,465,"What a marvelous train! You don't
mind if I borrow it, do you,
gentlemen?"
466,LOVELESS (CONT'D),466,"Other than a lack of wheelchair
access, I find it a most
comfortable way to pass the long
miles from here to my laboratory
in Spider Canyon..."
467,LOVELESS (CONT'D),467,"I'll be seeing President Grant
soon at Promontory Point. What
shall I tell him for you? I'm
afraid it can't be that you're
alive and well..."
468,WEST,468,"Gordon, get out your little tool
kit and get this damn thing off of
me!"
469,GORDON,469,"'Gentlemen, welcome to the
Loveless Experimental Camp for
Political Dissidents. There are
no guards. No barbed wire. As
long as you stay within the
designated perimeter, you will
stay alive.'"
470,MISS LIPPENREIDER,470,"West. How do you know it's not
just bullshit? Gordon. Step over
the fence and find out. Rita and
I will put flowers on your grave
every year."
471,WEST,471,I don't have time for this.
472,GORDON,472,"Wait, I have an auxiliary tool
kit!"
473,WEST,473,See?     Nothing happened.
474,GORDON,474,"Oh, really...?"
475,WEST,475,"Is it too late to take it off of
me now?"
476,MUNITIA,476,Caviar...?
477,LIPPENREIDER,477,Blini...?
478,LOVELESS,478,"Rita, my dear, not that I'm
ungrateful to Providence for
bringing you back to me..."
479,LOVELESS,479,"... I'm just a wee bit curious as
to how you managed to wind up with
them."
480,RITA,480,"Well, they uh... seemed so... sure
that they could find you... and I
thought if I stayed with them...
they'd lead me back to... all my
friends..."
481,RITA,481,"And not to give you a big head
but..."
482,RITA,482,I kinda missed you.
483,LOVELESS,483,"Isn't that a coincidence?    I miss
me, too."
484,GORDON,484,Head for that gully!
485,WEST,485,"When I give the signal.   Jump off
the cliff into my arms."
486,GORDON,486,"Are you crazy?! Do you see what's
down there?"
487,WEST,487,"Five, four, three, two..."
488,GORDON,488,Forget it.   I'm not doing it...
489,WEST,489,One...
490,GORDON,490,Oh shit!
491,GORDON,491,I just remembered... I can't swim!
492,WEST,492,You won't have to!
493,WEST,493,"Maybe I should have stayed inside
that fence another moment or two."
494,WEST,494,"All right, Gordon, what's your
plan? How are you gonna get this
damn thing off my neck?"
495,GORDON,495,Excuse me?
496,WEST,496,"Isn't that why you're here?
'Cause you're the master of,
you know, mechanical stuff?"
497,GORDON,497,"Oh. Oh, I see. Now I'm the master
of... 'mechanical stuff.' As opposed
to five minutes ago, when I was trying
to collect my thoughts and figure
out a way to get us out of these
contraptions! But no!"
498,GORDON,498,"-- That wouldn't have been any
fun for a certain somebody, and I
won't mention any names -- Jim
West! -- who decided to take me on
a bracing romp through a cornfield
and play a fanciful game of hide
and seek with serrated, spinning
death discs, while our only mode
of transportation is in the hands
of a sadistic madman with weapons
of mass destruction, who kidnapped
Rita, and is on his way to kill
our President and take over the
country!"
499,WEST,499,"Hey, calm down, Gordon..."
500,lost it),500,"No! Because I'm the 'Master of
Mechanical Stuff!' And I have to
help YOU! Because you're the
'Master of Stupid Stuff!'"
501,WEST,501,Gordon...
502,GORDON,502,"You want to get that collar off?
Fine! Let's do it the fun, Jim
West way!"
503,GORDON,503,Let's bash it with a rock!
504,WEST,504,"Gordon, you don't want to do that."
505,GORDON,505,"Oh, but I do."
506,GORDON,506,That's odd. What did you do?
507,WEST,507,I didn't do shit!
508,GORDON,508,"No, you must've reversed the
polarity of the magnets."
509,WEST,509,I did not do shit!
510,WEST,510,That's it --
511,GORDON,511,Are you all right?
512,WEST,512,"Oh, I'm peachey. Now help me get
my boot off!"
513,WEST,513,Ahhhh!
514,GORDON,514,"Apologies, apologies."
515,WEST,515,"Do me a favor. When you're
telling this story to your
grandkids, leave this part out."
516,GORDON,516,Don't worry.
517,WEST,517,"Now, when I undo your belt,
I'm going to run as fast as I
can that way, and you run as
fast as you can the other way.
Understand?"
518,GORDON,518,"You're going to run as fast as
you can one way and I'm going to
run as fast as I can the other...?
Ingenious."
519,WEST,519,One... two...
520,WEST,520,Three!
521,WEST,521,"Get off me, you steaming pile of
(GURGLE)!"
522,GORDON,522,"I'm trying, you son of a (GURGLE)!"
523,WEST,523,"I do not want to spend the rest
of my life looking like a meatball
on a plate."
524,GORDON,524,"We're going to have to discuss
bathroom etiquette soon. Very
soon."
525,GORDON,525,"Aha. My auxiliary tool kit.
I forgot all about it. It must've
slipped out of my pocket."
526,WEST,526,"Your pocket? Why wasn't it
attached to some spring-loaded
something-or-other that shoots
out of your ass?"
527,GORDON,527,"Because that, my friend, would be
uncomfortable."
528,WEST,528,"Why didn't you tell me you had an
'auxiliary' tool kit?"
529,GORDON,529,"I did tell you, but in your zeal
to run and leap off a two-hundred-
foot cliff, I don't think you
heard me."
530,WEST,530,What?!
531,GORDON,531,"'... Take physic, pomp; Expose
thyself to feel what wretches
feel, That thou mayst shake the
superflux to them, And show the
heavens more just.'"
532,GORDON,532,What?!
533,WEST,533,"You know, Gordon, you can be quite
annoying -- flaunting that fancy
education."
534,GORDON,534,"Well, truth be told, I never had a
fancy education -- not a formal
one, anyway."
535,WEST,535,"The Harvard thing seems pretty
formal to me."
536,GORDON,536,"This ring? This ring isn't real.
Do you want it?"
537,GORDON (CONT'D),537,"A prop. I'm an actor. Or was. I
gave it up. I went by the name of
Arthur Gordon. Ever hear of me?"
538,WEST,538,"No. How did you wind up in this
line of work?"
539,GORDON,539,"The pinnacle of my life in the
theater came in a production of
Our American Cousin -- a light
comedy -- at Ford's Theater in
Washington. There was this one
line I had... always got the
biggest laugh in the show. One
night, it drowned out the
gunshot that killed President
Lincoln."
540,GORDON,540,"I decided to devote my talents to
making sure that never happened
again."
541,GORDON,541,"Uh... There's a spider on your
hand. Doesn't that bother you?"
542,WEST,542,"She doesn't want any trouble.
She's just trying to get warm."
543,GORDON,543,"How come you know so much about
the desert, anyway?"
544,WEST,544,"The Indians taught me. I lived
out here when I was a boy."
545,WEST,545,Hey -- watch --
546,WEST,546,"The desert wasp... one of the
world's great hunters. She'll
kill the tarantula -- and lay her
eggs on it, so her babies can have
something to eat."
547,GORDON,547,Now I'm really hungry.
548,GORDON,548,"How did your parents, who I assume
were Negroes, feel about you being
raised by Indians?"
549,WEST,549,"They didn't have much to say about
it. I was sent to another
plantation when I was little. Ran
away as soon as my legs were
strong enough to take me."
550,GORDON,550,"Did you ever see your family
again?"
551,WEST,551,Yeah...
552,out fire),552,"They were at the camp at New
Liberty."
553,GORDON,553,"I'll help you get him, Jim."
554,GORDON,554,"You have no idea where you're
going, do you?"
555,WEST,555,"I know exactly where I'm goin'
... Spider Canyon."
556,WEST,556,"But I'm never gonna get there
with you draggin' that damn
thing around!"
557,GORDON,557,"While a magneto of this power
may not inspire your scientific
curiosity, it does mine. Besides,
you never know when it might come
in handy."
558,WEST,558,"Arte... when you're right, you're
right."
559,GORDON,559,"Well I think our partnership is
taking a big step forward. You
finally admitted I was right about
something."
560,GORDON,560,"Now... how about admitting you
were lost?"
561,WEST,561,Don't push it.
562,GORDON,562,"Jim, I know I've hallucinated
it several times before, so is
that really the Wanderer?"
563,WEST,563,That's the Wanderer.
564,GORDON,564,"And would it be too much to
hope that I'm simply seeing a
World's Fair down there... ?"
565,WEST,565,"Yeah, it would. That's Loveless'
Lair."
566,GORDON,566,Now that's impressive.
567,WEST,567,"Nice to see an invention that
actually works."
568,GORDON,568,"We'll see about that. The fool
doesn't even realize he's trapped."
569,WEST,569,"Gordon, let's ride!"
570,WEST,570,You do know how to ride...?
571,WEST,571,"... A horse, I mean."
572,GORDON,572,"Yes... I know how to ride a horse.
When the situation calls for
something primitive."
573,WEST,573,"How about now? There's a big
spider stompin' towards our
President!"
574,GORDON,574,"I was just thinking about another
spider. Remember in the desert,
when that little wasp killed the
tarantula...?"
575,WEST,575,"Yeah. Well, the wasp had a small
advantage. It could fly."
576,GORDON,576,Exactly!
577,GORDON,577,"In 1540, Leonardo Da Vinci
invented a flying machine called
the 'Ornithopter.' Though he
never actually flew it..."
578,WEST,578,"Artemus! There's no time for
plans or half-cocked inventions!
They don't work. We gotta stick
to what we're each good at!"
579,PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.),579,"May God continue the unity of our
country..."
580,PRESIDENT GRANT,580,"... as this railroad unites the
two great oceans of this world."
581,LOVELESS,581,"Well, isn't this a coincidence!
I'm out for a little mornin' ride,
and right in the middle of
nowhere, I bump into General
Ulysses S. Grant himself!"
582,LOVELESS,582,"We've never been properly
introduced. I'm Dr. Arliss
Loveless, formerly with the
Confederate Army."
583,PRESIDENT GRANT,583,"Yes, Dr. Loveless, what can I do
for you today?"
584,PRESIDENT GRANT,584,"Flank him, left and right."
585,LOVELESS,585,"I have a humble abode nearby, and
I hope you'll accept my
hospitality. I have a little
proposition to make."
586,PRESIDENT GRANT,586,What proposition is that?
587,LOVELESS,587,"The unconditional and immediate
surrender of the United States of
America to the Loveless Alliance."
588,PRESIDENT GRANT,588,I didn't realize we were at war.
589,LOVELESS,589,How about now...?
590,GORDON/GRANT,590,"In matters of war, the person to
talk to would be me."
591,LOVELESS,591,Now just who are you?
592,GORDON/GRANT,592,The President.
593,GORDON/GRANT,593,"He's just an actor hired to stand
in for me on public occasions. A
very bad actor, I must say... a
little puffy and overweight."
594,PRESIDENT GRANT,594,"Gordon, you've got a lot of brass.
Where's West?"
595,GORDON,595,"You know him, sir..."
596,GORDON/GRANT,596,"Captain, get this man out of my
sight! And next time get me a
real actor!"
597,LOVELESS,597,Take them both!!!
598,PRESIDENT GRANT,598,"Well, Gordon... was this part of
your plan?"
599,GORDON,599,"I'm by your side, sir.   That's
what's important."
600,LOVELESS,600,"Bonjour, buenas tardes and good
day! Great glorious day! A day
of healing for the wrongs that
have been done to us all!"
601,LOVELESS,601,"... Oh, how long have we waited!"
602,LOVELESS,602,"... 1776, wasn't it, old bean?
Most expensive cup o' tea in
history...!"
603,LOVELESS,603,Manhattan for a handful of beads?
604,LOVELESS,604,How?
605,LOVELESS,605,Remember the Alamo indeed!
606,LOVELESS,606,"Today I'm proud to be able to sit
before you and tell you the wrongs
will be righted... the past made
present... the United, divided!"
607,LOVELESS,607,"Great Britain gets back the
thirteen original colonies...
minus Manhattan."
608,LOVELESS,608,"Florida and the Fountain of Youth
go back to Spain!"
609,LOVELESS,609,"Texas, New Mexico, California,
Arizona revolve a Mexico!"
610,LOVELESS,610,"And the Louisiana Purchase reverts
back to the King of France!"
611,RITA,611,"Queen of Spain. King of France.
I was close."
612,MUNITIA,612,"Shut up and listen to a real
genius!"
613,LOVELESS,613,"And a tiny piece for me to retire
on."
614,LOVELESS,614,"My partner nations insist that we
make this as legal as possible.
Personally, I like the symmetry of
it. After all wasn't it you who
made us sign a surrender at
Appomattox?"
615,PRESIDENT GRANT,615,"Never will I sign that paper,
never will the United States ever
surrender!"
616,LOVELESS,616,"Well, sir, we're at loggerheads
then, aren't we? And I suppose
the threat of death to someone
with your valorous war record,
would mean nothing."
617,LOVELESS,617,"... so, if you still refuse to
sign this surrender... we'll start
by shooting your man, Gordon."
618,RITA,618,Artemus!
619,GORDON,619,"Don't worry, I'm wearing the
Impermeable."
620,GORDON,620,"If I may have one request... it's
that she aim at my heart... which
has loved this great country so
much!"
621,LOVELESS,621,Shoot him in the head.
622,GORDON,622,Great.
623,CHANTEUSE,623,"'Ohhh... Hangtown gals are plump
and rosy...'"
624,CHANTEUSE,624,"'Hair in ringlets, mighty cozy...'"
625,LOVELESS,625,A new girl!   What a nice surprise!
626,CHANTEUSE,626,"'Painted cheeks and frilly
corsets.'"
627,CHANTEUSE,627,Touch them...'
628,CHANTEUSE,628,"'... And they'll sting like
hornets!'"
629,LOVELESS,629,"Ebonia! Why are you so cruel to
me?"
630,GORDON,630,I have a dress like that.
631,CHANTEUSE,631,'Hangtown gals are lovely
632,CHANTEUSE,632,Think they'll marry Mormon
633,CHANTEUSE,633,"'Heads thrown back to show their
features...'"
634,COLEMAN,634,"Go, Ebonia, go."
635,WEST,635,Ha... Ha... Hangtown girls...
636,GORDON,636,"Not to sound ungrateful, but you're
a little over the top."
637,WEST,637,Ha... Ha... Ha...
638,GORDON,638,"Let me warn you about that
dress..."
639,WEST,639,Gotta go. Big finish...
640,WEST,640,"'Ha, ha, ha! Hangtown gals!!!'"
641,PRESIDENT GRANT,641,Where'd those come from...?
642,COLEMAN,642,Captain West.
643,RITA,643,She's... no...!
644,WEST,644,"'Ha, ha, ha... Hang... Town...
Girls!!!'"
645,WEST,645,"Wait a minute. What the hell
is this?"
646,RITA,646,"Serves you right for staring at
them."
647,LOVELESS,647,Kill him!
648,LOVELESS,648,Him! Him! The girl!
649,GORDON,649,Was that the eight ball?
650,WEST,650,Mmm-hmm.
651,GORDON,651,That one's an incendiary bomb.
652,WEST/GORDON,652,Rita!
653,RITA,653,Meet me after the show!
654,COLEMAN,654,"Special Marshal... President
thought you needed some lookin'
after."
655,FRENCH MINISTER,655,"Monsieur, we are your partners!
You can't let us die in this
fire!!"
656,LOVELESS,656,"It's not the first time y'all have
been burned in America."
657,COLEMAN,657,"This is diabolical! They've got
the President and I've still got
that silly song in my head!"
658,GORDON,658,"C'mon we gotta go! We gotta ride
horse! Something!"
659,WEST,659,"No, Arte.   Right now, we need
a plan."
660,WEST,660,"That flyin' machine idea of
yours... were you just acting like
you knew what you were talking
about... or could you build it?"
661,GORDON (O.S.),661,"Now Bernoulli's Principle states
that the air flowing over a bird's
wings... is moving at a lower
pressure than the pressure below
the wing... that's called 'lift.'
Course, it's just a theory... it's
never been tested."
662,WEST,662,"You're not makin' me feel any
better."
663,COLEMAN,663,"Here's a coupla bon voyage
presents."
664,GORDON,664,"Coleman! Must you smoke when
handling explosives!"
665,WEST,665,"He's just a little nervous 'cause
no one's ever flown before."
666,WEST,666,Avant...! Avant!!!
667,GORDON,667,"We're not getting enough lift!
We need more speed!"
668,WEST,668,"Hey, uh... that's the cliff over
there, you know?"
669,GORDON,669,"Yes, I do know."
670,GORDON,670,It worked...? It worked!!
671,WEST,671,"If you had to get one right, I'm
real glad it was this one."
672,GORDON,672,Yeee-haaa!
673,LOVELESS,673,"Mr. President, I'll ask you once
again. Sign the surrender or I
decimate this town!"
674,PRESIDENT GRANT,674,You've had my answer.
675,LOVELESS,675,"I find the sound of people
screaming while they get blown to
smithereens, ruins the ear for
music. Don't you?"
676,LOVELESS,676,Commence firing!
677,GORDON,677,I think I'll call it...
678,WEST,678,Lemme guess... an Elevation Enhancer?
679,GORDON,679,"No, Air... Gordon."
680,WEST,680,"Go down, down there!"
681,GORDON,681,"You can't just 'go down there.'
Flight depends on lift, which must
be calibrated to the angle of
descent..."
682,WEST,682,"Shut up and go down there, will
ya?"
683,LOVELESS,683,"Well, Mr. President. Have you had
enough yet? Would you like to
sign the surrender or shall we set
a course for Denver? Wichita?
Washington, perhaps?"
684,PRESIDENT GRANT,684,"Well, I'll be damned... it's West
and Gordon... flying!"
685,PRESIDENT GRANT,685,"Keep that surrender handy. I
think you're going to need it!"
686,LOVELESS,686,Don't be too sure...
687,LOVELESS,687,"I'm through with diplomacy... Take
him away and kill him!"
688,WEST,688,"What does your boy da Vinci say
about puttin' this bird down?"
689,GORDON,689,"I don't think he thought it would
ever work, so he didn't get that
far. I'm open to suggestions."
690,WEST,690,"Take out as many bad guys out as
you can."
691,LOVELESS,691,Munitia!   Munitia!!!
692,GORDON,692,"Sorry about that, sir. Nose up,
flaps down. Have to remember that
next time."
693,PRESIDENT GRANT,693,"Son, never apologize for saving a
President's life."
694,AMAZONIA (O.S.),694,"Soon you all can fly again. This
time with little angel wings."
695,LOVELESS,695,"Gentlemen, I am truly impressed by
your effort and ingenuity. Why
not swear an oath of loyalty to
me... and forego your executions."
696,WEST,696,"Why not? Well, I guess maybe I'd
rather see what happens when I
stuff your ass into that cannon
up there and fertilize the
landscape."
697,GORDON,697,"Uh, Jim, I think a polite 'no'
would suffice..."
698,LOVELESS,698,"Lippenreider, take over the
controls."
699,LOVELESS,699,"We may not have a woodshed on
board, but that boy is gonna get a
whoopin' anyway!"
700,WEST,700,"So, I guess you're the one who's
gonna give me my whoopin'."
701,WEST,701,Pfft.   I got one a' those.
702,WEST,702,But you've got two of those.
703,WEST,703,"Okay, lemme talk to Gordon, I'll
see if he can..."
704,WEST,704,Damn.
705,WEST,705,No more Mister Knife guy!
706,SHOVEL GUY,706,I learned that from a Chinaman.
707,WEST,707,I just made that up.
708,WEST,708,Don't forget your shovel!
709,WEST,709,"Is that all you got for me,
Loveless?!"
710,WEST,710,"Uh, I just threw my shovel out.
So this really isn't fair. If
you don't mind, I'd like to..."
711,"WEST
(incredulous)",711,Noooo.
712,WEST,712,Sorry.
713,METAL HEAD,713,Urrrrrrrrrrggggghhh!!!
714,"WEST
(downward)",714,"You guys just don't get out
enough."
715,WEST,715,"When you get right down to it,
Loveless, you just can't beat
a good pair of legs."
716,LOVELESS,716,"You're obviously not a poker
player, Mr. West..."
717,LOVELESS,717,Two pair always beats a pair.
718,LOVELESS,718,"Now... Was it someone particularly
close to you who perished in that
military action?"
719,"LOVELESS
(stunned)",719,"Hmmm.   Well, that hit a nerve."
720,LOVELESS,720,"A mother, perhaps? A father?"
721,LOVELESS,721,"It feels so good to stretch my
legs."
722,LOVELESS,722,"I likes to beat my feet on the
Mississippi mud!"
723,GORDON,723,Stop this violence!
724,PRESIDENT GRANT,724,Drop 'em.
725,GORDON (O.S.),725,Stop or I'll shoot!
726,LOVELESS,726,"You expect to kill me with that
little pea shooter?"
727,GORDON,727,If I have to.    Yes.
728,LOVELESS,728,"Why is it, that I'm unafraid?"
729,LOVELESS,729,"I believe you gentlemen are the
polar opposites of a moral
dilemma and I'm stuck in the
middle. On one end, we have
Mr. West, a man of primitive
vigours uncomplicated by
intellect. And on the other,
there's Mr. Gordon. A man of
ideas, but unlike myself, lacks
the passion to kill for them.
He'd like to be able to act his
way out of it. And for some
reason when he's actin', someone
always seems to get killed."
730,WEST,730,"Shoot him, Gordon...!"
731,LOVELESS,731,"I'm right about you, aren't I,
Gordon? And that's why I'm
gonna kill your friend here.
Then I'm going to kill you."
732,LOVELESS,732,"After all that, you missed."
733,GORDON,733,Not exactly.
734,WEST,734,"Better than a fountain pen, don't
you think."
735,WEST,735,"By the way, your chivalry's about
to be tested."
736,PRESIDENT GRANT,736,"We'll be joining them in a moment
if you can't stop that thing!"
737,PRESIDENT GRANT,737,"Let's see how clever you really
are..."
738,WEST,738,"For almost four long years I've
been trackin' the animal
responsible for the Massacre at
New Liberty. And I hear that's you..."
739,LOVELESS,739,"Please, West... show a little mercy
to a poor defenseless cripple..."
740,WEST,740,"Now, now, Doctor... let's not cloud
this otherwise sunny day with that
poor-ol'-me-cripple-talk. Just
buck up and say to yourself, 'I am
indefatigably hard-pumpin' and
steely!'"
741,LOVELESS,741,"After I kill ya, I swear I'm gonna
boil you down to axle grease!"
742,WEST,742,Now that's the ol' doctor I know!
743,LOVELESS,743,"Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
How did we arrive in this dark
situation?"
744,WEST,744,I don't know.    Guess I'm stumped!
745,LOVELESS,745,"And I'm so cotton-pickin' afraid
of heights. They just give me the
spooks!"
746,WEST,746,"Ah, don't be afraid, Loveless.
With this being the last leg of
our journey and all, you should
soak in the view, you're really
missing something."
747,LOVELESS,747,"Mister West, I'm gonna cut this
conversation short..."
748,WEST,748,"Good one, Loveless.   I didn't think
of that one."
749,LOVELESS,749,"Mister West!!! I am faced with a
difficult decision here. On one
hand, there is the overwhelming
love that I have for myself, and
on the other, the raw, seething
hatred I have for you! Now, I
could kill you very easily, just
by pulling this lever..."
750,LOVELESS,750,"But, of course, I would die along
with you. I guess the only thing
that I can take comfort in is the
hope that you would hit those
rocks a second before me and I
could enjoy immeasurable bliss
before I vanish."
751,LOVELESS,751,"What to do, what to do..."
752,WEST,752,"Allow me to make that decision
easy on you, Loveless. Because
I want to see you dead a hell of
a lot more than I want to live."
753,LOVELESS,753,"Why is it that I have a sneaking
suspicion, that although you are
as black as the night on the
outside... inside, you are yellow?!"
754,LOVELESS,754,"You don't have it in you, do you...
boy?!"
755,WEST,755,"You were right. Let's cut this
conversation short!"
756,LOVELESS,756,Weeeeeeeeeest!!!!
757,WEST,757,Now that looked like it hurt.
758,PRESIDENT GRANT,758,"Gentlemen, I now strongly believe
the United States is going to be
truly united. Not because of this
railroad... but because of you."
759,PRESIDENT GRANT,759,"I've signed into law the creation
of an agency whose sole duty is to
protect the President and the
country from lunatics like
Loveless."
760,PRESIDENT GRANT,760,"Welcome to the Secret Service,
Agents No. 1 and No. 2."
761,GORDON,761,"Uh, just out of curiosity, sir...
who's Agent No. 1?"
762,PRESIDENT GRANT,762,"I don't think that matters very
much, do you? Gordon? Besides,
you'll have plenty of time to
discuss it on your new assignment."
763,PRESIDENT GRANT,763,See you back in Washington.
764,GORDON,764,"But, sir... what about our train?"
765,PRESIDENT GRANT,765,"Well, I'm taking it of course.
Hell, you let Loveless blow up
mine."
766,RITA (O.S.),766,Jim... Arte...?
767,WEST,767,Rita!   You look great.
768,GORDON,768,"Ravishing, a vision."
769,RITA,769,"I just wanted to thank you for
everything you've done for me...
before I went back home to Texas."
770,WEST,770,"Texas? Why're you going back
there? Why don't you come with me
back to Washington?"
771,GORDON,771,"Or better still, come with me to
Washington. I could introduce you
to people I still know in the
theater..."
772,WEST,772,"She's not really an entertainer,
remember?"
773,RITA,773,I can't go with either of you.
774,RITA,774,"It's not that you both don't have
your attributes."
775,RITA,775,"You're so sophisticated and such a
wonderful cook."
776,RITA,776,"Jim, you're good with a gun... and
have great legs."
777,RITA,777,"And you're both so brave. But...
I'm afraid I haven't been
completely honest with you."
778,WEST AND GORDON,778,Uh-oh...
779,RITA,779,"Professor Escobar's not my father.
He's my husband."
780,WEST,780,"Rita... why didn't you just tell
us that in the first place?"
781,RITA,781,"Well, I was going to... but would
you have really brought me along
if I said I was married?
Honestly."
782,RITA,782,I didn't think so.
783,RITA,783,"At least you still have each
other."
784,WEST (O.S.),784,"You know, Arte..."
785,GORDON (O.S.),785,"What's that, Jim?"
786,WEST (O.S.),786,Maybe Rita's right...
787,WEST,787,"Besides... there's a lot of
other women in the world."
788,GORDON,788,"That's easy for you to say. She
didn't walk off with your best
dress."
