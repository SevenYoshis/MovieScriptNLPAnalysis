0,CLARICE,0,Freeze! FBI!
1,BRIGHAM (O.S.),1,"Okay, people, good exercise..."
2,BRIGHAM,2,"Starling's reaction time was
excellent. Let's break. Critique in
five."
3,ARDELIA,3,"Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?"
4,CLARICE,4,Never cock. Just squeeze.
5,ARDELIA,5,I love it when you talk dirty.
6,BRIGHAM,6,"What're you laughin' at, Junior G-
Man? She got off four rounds to your
two."
7,BRIGHAM,7,"One hundred reps, each hand, every
day. Now tidy up, the Section Chief
wants to see you."
8,CLARICE,8,What'd I do?
9,ARDELIA,9,"Stay cool. Just remember to call him
""God."""
10,CRAWFORD,10,"Starling, Clarice M., good morning."
11,CLARICE,11,"Good morning, Mr. Crawford."
12,CRAWFORD,12,"Your instructors tell me you're doing
well. Top quarter of the class."
13,CLARICE,13,"I hope so. They haven't posted
anything."
14,CRAWFORD,14,"A job's come up and I thought about
you. Not really a job, more of - an
interesting errand. Walk me to my
car, Starling."
15,CRAWFORD,15,"We're trying to interview all of the
serial killers now in custody, for a
psychobehavioral profile. Could be a
big help in unsolved cases. Most of
them have been happy to talk to us.
They have a compulsion to boast,
these people... Do you spook easily,
Starling?"
16,CLARICE,16,Not yet.
17,CRAWFORD,17,"You see, the one we want most refuses
to cooperate. I want you to go after
him again today, in the asylum."
18,CLARICE,18,Who's the subject?
19,CRAWFORD,19,"The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal
Lecter."
20,CLARICE,20,The cannibal...
21,CLARICE,21,"Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad
for the chance, sir, but - why me?"
22,CRAWFORD,22,"You're qualified and available. And
frankly, I can't spare a real agent
right now."
23,CRAWFORD,23,"I don't expect him to talk to you,
but I have to be able to say we
tried... Lecter was a brilliant
psychiatrist, and he knows all the
dodges."
24,CRAWFORD,24,"Dossier on him, copy of our
questionnaire, special ID for you...
If he won't talk, then I want straight
reporting. How's he look, how's his
cell look, what's he writing? The
Director himself will see your report,
over your own signature - if I decide
it's good enough. I want that by
0800 Wednesday, and keep this to
yourself."
25,CRAWFORD,25,"Now. I want your full attention,
Starling. Are you listening to me?"
26,CLARICE,26,Yes sir.
27,CRAWFORD,27,"Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go
over the physical procedures used
with him. Do not deviate from them,
for any reason. You tell him nothing
personal, Starling. Believe me, you
don't want Hannibal Lecter inside
your head... Just do your job, but
never forget what he is."
28,CLARICE,28,"And what is that, sir?"
29,CHILTON (V.O.),29,"Oh, he's a monster. A pure
psychopath..."
30,CHILTON (O.S.),30,"It's so rare to capture one alive.
From a research point of view, Dr.
Lecter is our most prized asset..."
31,CHILTON,31,"You know, we get a lot of detectives
here, but I must say, I can't ever
remember one so attractive..."
32,CHILTON,32,"Will you be in Baltimore overnight...?
Because this can be quite a fun town,
if you have the right guide."
33,CLARICE,33,"I'm sure it's a great town, Dr.
Chilton, but my instructions are to
talk to Lecter and report back this
afternoon."
34,CHILTON,34,I see.
35,CHILTON,35,"Let's make this quick, then. I'm
busy."
36,CHILTON,36,"Lecter carved up nine people - that
we're sure of - and cooked his
favorite bits. We've tried to study
him, of course - but he's much too
sophisticated for the standard tests.
And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm
his nemesis... Crawford's very clever,
isn't he? Using you."
37,CLARICE,37,"How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?"
38,CHILTON,38,"A pretty young woman, to turn him
on? I don't believe Lecter's ever
seen a woman in eight years. And oh,
are you ever his ""taste"" - so to
speak."
39,CLARICE,39,"I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor.
It's not a charm school."
40,CHILTON,40,"Good. Then you should be able to
remember the rules."
41,CHILTON,41,"Do not reach through the bars, do
not touch the bars. You pass him
nothing but soft paper - no pens or
pencils. No staples or paperclips in
his paper. Use the sliding food
carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept
anything he attempts to hold out to
you. Do you understand me?"
42,CLARICE,42,I understand.
43,CHILTON,43,"I'm going to show you why we insist
on such precautions... On the
afternoon of July 8, 1981, he
complained of chest pains and was
taken to the dispensary. His
mouthpiece and restraints were removed
for an EKG. When the nurse bent over
him, he did this to her..."
44,CHILTON,44,"The doctors managed to re-set her
jaw, more or less, and save one of
her eyes. His pulse never got over
eighty-five, even when he ate her
tongue."
45,CHILTON,45,I keep him in here.
46,CLARICE,46,"Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're
his enemy - as you've said - then
maybe I'll have more luck by myself.
What do you think?"
47,CHILTON,47,"You might have suggested that in my
office, and saved me the time."
48,CLARICE,48,"But then I would've missed the
pleasure of your company."
49,CHILTON,49,"When she's finished, bring her out."
50,BARNEY,50,"Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't
get near the bars?"
51,CLARICE,51,"Clarice Starling. Yes, he did."
52,BARNEY,52,"Okay. Past the others, it's the last
cell. Stay to the middle. I put out
a chair for you."
53,BARNEY,53,I'm watching. You'll do fine.
54,DARK FIGURE,54,I c-can sssmell your cunt!
55,CLARICE,55,"Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice
Starling. May I talk with you?"
56,DR. LECTER,56,Good morning.
57,CLARICE,57,"Doctor, we have a hard problem in
psychological profiling. I want to
ask for your help with a
questionnaire."
58,DR. LECTER,58,"""We"" being the Behavioral Science
Unit, at Quantico. You're one of
Jack Crawford's, I expect."
59,CLARICE,59,"I am, yes."
60,DR. LECTER,60,May I see your credentials?
61,DR. LECTER,61,"Closer, please... Clo-ser..."
62,DR. LECTER,62,"That expires in one week. You're not
real FBI, are you?"
63,CLARICE,63,"I'm - still in training at the
Academy."
64,DR. LECTER,64,Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
65,CLARICE,65,"We're talking about psychology,
Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide
for yourself whether or not I'm
qualified?"
66,DR. LECTER,66,"Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of
you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please."
67,DR. LECTER,67,Now then. What did Miggs say to you?
68,DR. LECTER,68,"""Multiple Miggs,"" in the next cell.
He hissed at you. What did he say?"
69,CLARICE,69,"He said - ""I can smell your cunt."""
70,DR. LECTER,70,"I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan
skin cream, and sometimes you wear
L'Air du Temps, but not today. You
brought your best bag, though, didn't
you?"
71,CLARICE,71,Yes.
72,DR. LECTER,72,It's much better than your shoes.
73,CLARICE,73,Maybe they'll catch up.
74,DR. LECTER,74,I have no doubt of it.
75,CLARICE,75,"Did you do those drawings, Doctor?"
76,DR. LECTER,76,"Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the
Belvedere. Do you know Florence?"
77,CLARICE,77,"All that detail, just from memory...?"
78,DR. LECTER,78,"Memory, Officer Starling, is what I
have instead of view."
79,CLARICE,79,"Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -"
80,DR. LECTER,80,"No, no, no. You were doing fine,
you'd been courteous and receptive
to courtesy, you'd established trust
with the embarrassing truth about
Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire. It won't
do. It's stupid and boring."
81,CLARICE,81,"I'm only asking you to look at this,
Doctor. Either you will or you won't."
82,DR. LECTER,82,"Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed
if he's recruiting help from the
student body. Busy hunting that new
one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty
boy! Did Crawford send you to ask
for my advice on him?"
83,CLARICE,83,"No, I came because we need -"
84,DR. LECTER,84,"How many women has he used, our Bill?"
85,CLARICE,85,Five... so far.
86,DR. LECTER,86,All flayed...?
87,CLARICE,87,"Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's
an active case, I'm not involved. If -"
88,DR. LECTER,88,"Do you know why he's called Buffalo
Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't
say."
89,CLARICE,89,"I'll tell you if you'll look at this
form."
90,CLARICE,90,"It started as a bad joke in Kansas
City Homicide. They said... this one
likes to skin his humps."
91,DR. LECTER,91,"Witless and misleading. Why do you
think he takes their skins, Officer
Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom."
92,CLARICE,92,"It excites him. Most serial killers
keep some sort of trophies."
93,DR. LECTER,93,I didn't.
94,CLARICE,94,No. You ate yours.
95,DR. LECTER,95,Send that through.
96,DR. LECTER,96,"Oh, Officer Starling... do you think
you can dissect me with this blunt
little tool?"
97,CLARICE,97,No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
98,DR. LECTER,98,"You're sooo ambitious, aren't you...?
You know what you look like to me,
with your good bag and your cheap
shoes? You look like a rube. A well-
scrubbed, hustling rube with a little,
taste... Good nutrition has given
you some length of bone, but you're
not more than one generation from
poor white trash, are you Officer
Starling...? That accent you're trying
so desperately to shed - pure West
Virginia. What was your father, dear?
Was he a coal miner? Did he stink of
the lamp...? And oh, how quickly the
boys found you! All those tedious,
sticky fumblings, in the back seats
of cars, while you could only dream
of getting out. Getting anywhere -
yes? Getting all the way - to the
F...B...I."
99,CLARICE,99,"You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are
you strong enough to point that high-
powered perception at yourself? How
about it...? Look at yourself and
write down the truth."
100,CLARICE,100,Or maybe you're afraid to.
101,DR. LECTER,101,"You're a tough one, aren't you?"
102,CLARICE,102,Reasonably so. Yes.
103,DR. LECTER,103,"And you'd hate to think you were
common. My, wouldn't that sting!
Well you're far from common, Officer
Starling. All you have is the fear
of it."
104,DR. LECTER,104,Now please excuse me. Good day.
105,CLARICE,105,And the questionnaire...?
106,DR. LECTER,106,"A census taker once tried to test
me. I ate his liver with some fava
beans and a nice chianti... Fly back
to school, little Starling."
107,MIGGS,107,"I b-bit my wrist so I c-can diiiieeee!
S-ee how it bleeeeeeeeds?"
108,DR. LECTER (O.S.),108,Officer Starling... Officer Starling!
109,DR. LECTER,109,"I would not have had that happen to
you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably
ugly to me."
110,CLARICE,110,Then please - do this test for me.
111,DR. LECTER,111,"No. But I will make you happy...
I'll give you a chance for what you
love most, Clarice Starling."
112,CLARICE,112,"What's that, Dr. Lecter?"
113,DR. LECTER,113,"Advancement, of course."
114,DR. LECTER,114,"Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an
old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T...
Now go. Go."
115,DR. LECTER,115,"I don't think Miggs could manage
again so soon, even if he is crazy -
do you?"
116,ARDELIA,116,"Phone call, Clarice. It's God."
117,CLARICE,117,"Thanks, Ardelia."
118,ARDELIA,118,"You missed Fourth Amendment law.
Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff.
Where were you all afternoon?"
119,CLARICE,119,"Pleading with a crazy man, with come
all over my face."
120,ARDELIA,120,"Damn. Wish I had time for a social
life."
121,CLARICE,121,Mr. Crawford?
122,CRAWFORD,122,"I've read your interim memo on Lecter.
You sure you've left nothing out?"
123,CLARICE,123,"It's all there, sir, practically
verbatim."
124,CRAWFORD,124,"Every word, Starling? Every gesture?"
125,CLARICE,125,Right down to the kleenex I used.
126,CLARICE,126,"Sir, why? Is something wrong?"
127,CRAWFORD,127,"He mentioned a name, at the very
end. ""Mofet..."" Any followup on her?"
128,CLARICE,128,"I spent all evening on the mainframe.
Lecter altered or destroyed most of
his patient histories, prior to
capture. No record of anyone named
Mofet. But ""Split City"" sounded like
it might have have something to do
with divorce. I tracked it down in
the library's catalogue of national
yellow pages."
129,CLARICE,129,"It's a mini-storage facility outside
Baltimore, where Lecter had his
practice."
130,CRAWFORD,130,"Well? Why aren't you there right
now?"
131,CLARICE,131,"Sir, that's a field job. It's outside
the scope of my assignment. And I've
got a test tomorrow on -"
132,CRAWFORD,132,"Do you recall my instructions to
you, Starling? What were they?"
133,CLARICE,133,"To complete and file my report by
0800 Wednesday. But sir -"
134,CRAWFORD,134,"Then do that, Starling. Do just
exactly that."
135,CLARICE,135,"Sir, what is it? There's something
you're not telling me."
136,CRAWFORD,136,Miggs has been murdered.
137,CLARICE,137,Murdered...? How?
138,CRAWFORD,138,"The orderly heard Lecter whispering
to him, all afternoon, and Miggs
crying. They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue...
Chilton is scared stiff the family
will file a civil rights lawsuit,
and he's trying to blame it on you.
I told the little prick your conduct
was flawless."
139,CRAWFORD,139,Starling...?
140,CLARICE,140,"I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know
how to feel about it."
141,CRAWFORD,141,"You don't have to feel any way about
it. Lecter did it to amuse himself.
Why not, what can they do? Take away
his books for awhile, and no jello..."
142,CRAWFORD,142,"I know it got ugly today. But this
is your report, Starling - take it
as far as you can. On your own time,
outside of class. Now carry on."
143,CLARICE,143,"Well God damn it! You old creep.
Creepo son of a bitch. Let Miggs
squirt you and see how you like it."
144,CRAWFORD,144,"I'll take over, Patricia. You get
some rest."
145,MR. YOW (V.O.),145,"Unit 31 was leased for ten years.
Pre-paid in full... The contract is
in the name of ""Miss Hester Mofet."""
146,CLARICE,146,"So no one's been in here since -
1980?"
147,MR. YOW,147,"Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a
great concern to my customers. But,
if you say this is an FBI matter..."
148,CLARICE,148,"I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I
promise. Be gone before you know it."
149,MR. YOW,149,"We could return tomorrow, with my
son. Or perhaps some workmen...?"
150,CLARICE,150,"Would you hold these, please?"
151,MR. YOW,151,"It smells like mice... I think I
hear them, too - don't you?"
152,MR. YOW,152,You're going in there?
153,CLARICE,153,"Mr. Yow, if this door should fall
down -ha ha! - or anything else -
would you be kind enough to call
this number? It's our Baltimore field
office. They know you're here with
me... Do you understand?"
154,MR. YOW,154,"Might I suggest tucking your pants
into your socks? To prevent mouse
intrusion."
155,CLARICE,155,Good idea.
156,MR. YOW (O.S.),156,"Okay, Miss Starling?"
157,CLARICE,157,"Okay, Mr. Yow..."
158,MR. YOW (O.S.),158,"You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?"
159,CLARICE,159,That wasn't me.
160,MR. YOW (O.S.),160,Oh.
161,CLARICE,161,"Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks
like somebody is sitting in this
car."
162,MR. YOW (O.S.),162,"Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better
come out now, Miss Starling."
163,CLARICE,163,Not yet! - just wait for me.
164,CLARICE,164,Maybe in about two seconds.
165,CLARICE,165,"Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas
anymore."
166,CLARICE (O.S.),166,"It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?"
167,CLARICE,167,"Hester Mofet... ""The rest of me.""
Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you
rented that place."
168,CLARICE,168,"You put those - things in there.
Paid for it in advance, ten years
ago... Why, Dr. Lecter?"
169,CLARICE,169,Thank you.
170,DR. LECTER,170,Your bleeding has stopped.
171,CLARICE,171,How did -
172,CLARICE,172,It's nothing. A scratch.
173,DR. LECTER,173,"Why don't you ask me about Buffalo
Bill?"
174,CLARICE,174,"Why? Do you know something about
him?"
175,DR. LECTER,175,"I might if I saw the case file. You
could get that for me."
176,CLARICE,176,"Why don't you tell me about ""Miss
Mofet?"" You wanted me to find him.
Or do I have to wait for the lab?"
177,DR. LECTER,177,"His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A
former patient of mine, whose romantic
attachments ran to, shall we say,
the exotic...? I didn't kill him,
merely tucked him away. Very much as
I found him, in that ridiculous car,
in his own garage, after he's missed
three appointments. You'd have him
under ""Missing Person"" - which, in
poor Raspail's case, could hardly be
more true."
178,CLARICE,178,"If you didn't kill him, then who
did?"
179,DR. LECTER,179,"Who can say...? Best thing for him,
really. His therapy was going nowhere."
180,CLARICE,180,"Wouldn't it have been easier to just
leave him for the police to find?"
181,DR. LECTER,181,"And have them clomping about in my
life? Oh dear, no... At that time I
still had certain private amusements
of my own."
182,DR. LECTER,182,"How did you feel when you saw him,
Clarice? May I call you Clarice?"
183,CLARICE,183,"Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated."
184,DR. LECTER,184,Ahhh... Why?
185,CLARICE,185,Because you weren't wasting my time.
186,DR. LECTER,186,"Do you have something you use, when
you need to get up your courage?
Memories, tableaux... scenes from
your early life?"
187,CLARICE,187,"I don't know. Next time I'll have to
check."
188,DR. LECTER,188,"Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he? Apparently he likes you.
And you like him, too."
189,CLARICE,189,I never thought about it.
190,DR. LECTER,190,"Your first lie to me, Clarice. How
sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford
wants you, sexually? True, he's much
older, but - do you think he
visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...?
Fucking you?"
191,CLARICE,191,"That doesn't interest me, Doctor.
And it's the sort of thing Miggs
would ask."
192,DR. LECTER,192,Not anymore.
193,DR. LECTER,193,"Surely the odd confluence of events
hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford
dangles you before me. Then I give
you a bit of help. Do you think it's
because I like to look at you, and
imagine how good you would taste...?"
194,CLARICE,194,I don't know. Is it?
195,DR. LECTER,195,"Or doesn't this all begin to suggest
to you a kind of... negotiation?
There's something Crawford can give
me, and I want to trade for it. I
even wrote to him, offering my help.
But he hates me, so he won't deal
directly."
196,DR. LECTER,196,"Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just
like that gospel program. When you
leave, they'll turn the volume way
up. Chilton does enjoy his petty
torments."
197,CLARICE,197,"Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You
know, don't you?"
198,DR. LECTER,198,"I've been in this room for eight
years, Clarice. I know they will
never, ever let me out while I'm
alive. What I want is a view. I want
a window where I can see a tree, or
even water. I want to be in a federal
institution, away from Chilton - and
I want a view. I'll give good value
for it. Crawford could do that for
me, but he won't. You persuade him."
199,CLARICE,199,Who killed your patient?
200,DR. LECTER,200,"Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you
and Jack Crawford are most anxious
to meet."
201,CLARICE,201,Buffalo Bill...?
202,CLARICE,202,"Bill killed him, all those years
ago...? That's impossible."
203,DR. LECTER,203,"Who is he stalking right now, Clarice?
I wonder, don't you? How many more
young women will have to die, before
you trade with me...?"
204,CATHERINE,204,"This stuff's givin' me the munchies.
Where's that bag of popcorn?"
205,CODY,205,Shit. Left the groceries in the car.
206,CATHERINE,206,"'S okay, I'll go."
207,CATHERINE,207,Help you with that?
208,MAN,208,Would you? Thanks.
209,MAN (O.S.),209,"Let's slide it up, you mind?"
210,MAN,210,Are you about a size 14?
211,CATHERINE,211,What?
212,MAN,212,Good.
213,MAN,213,Good.
214,MAN,214,Gooood...
215,INSTRUCTOR (O.S.),215,"Electron microscopy reveals fiber
""signatures"" that are nearly as
distinct as fingerprints..."
216,INSTRUCTOR (O.S.),216,"Both of these blouses were worn by
victims of Buffalo Bill. They were
found in two different states, and
four months apart. He always slits
them up the back, like a funeral
suit..."
217,INSTRUCTOR (O.S.),217,"The bunching you see - this
compression - is characteristic of
scissor cuts, rather than a single
blade. And, as you see - Bill always
uses the same pair..."
218,BRIGHAM,218,Clarice Starling! Are you in here?
219,BRIGHAM,219,"Get your field gear, take stuff for
overnight. You're goin' with Crawford."
220,CLARICE,220,Where?
221,BRIGHAM,221,"Some fishermen in West Virginia found
an unidentified girl's body. It's a
Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in
the water about a week, and Jack
needs somebody that can print a
floater. Think you can handle it?"
222,CLARICE,222,"I'll need the big fingerprint kit...
and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU-
5, with film packs and batteries."
223,BRIGHAM,223,"Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't
he? Impatient..."
224,CLARICE,224,Sometimes.
225,BRIGHAM,225,"He's got a lot on his mind besides
Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is
real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin'
you about it now, 'cause he may never."
226,BRIGHAM,226,"You're goin' in the field, so you
gotta have full kit. Take this -
it's my own..."
227,BRIGHAM,227,"Wear it, don't ever leave it in your
purse. Dry fire it whenever you get
the chance. And do your exercises."
228,CLARICE,228,I will... I promise.
229,BRIGHAM,229,"Listen, I hope you never need a thing
I've taught you. But you've got
something... Jack sees it, I do too.
If you ever need to, you can shoot."
230,BRIGHAM,230,"Bless you, Starling..."
231,CRAWFORD (O.S.),231,He keeps them alive for three days.
232,CRAWFORD,232,"Why, we don't yet know... There's no
evidence of rape or physical abuse
prior to death. All the mutilation
you see there is post-mortem."
233,CRAWFORD,233,"I'm hot, are you hot? Bobby, it's
too damned hot back here..."
234,CRAWFORD,234,"So. Three days. Then he shoots them,
skins them - usually just the torsos -
and dumps them. Each body in a
different river, in a different state,
downstream from an interstate highway.
The water leaves us no fingerprints,
fibers, DNA fluids - no trace evidence
at all. That's Fredrica Bimmel, the
first one..."
235,CRAWFORD (O.S.),235,"A big girl, like all the rest. Went
about 160... Her corpse was the only
one he took the trouble to weight
down, so actually, she was the third
girl found. After her, he got lazy..."
236,CRAWFORD,236,"Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio,
where the Bimmel girl was abducted.
Blue triangle where her body was
found - down here in Missouri. Same
marks for the other four girls, in
different colors. This new one,
today... washed up here."
237,CRAWFORD,237,"Elk River, in West Virginia, about
six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies."
238,CLARICE,238,"There's no correlation at all between
where they're kidnapped and where
they're found...?"
239,CLARICE,239,"What if - what if you trace the
heaviest-traffic routes backwards
from the dump sites? Do they converge
at all?"
240,CRAWFORD,240,"Good idea, but he thought of it,
too. We've run simulations, using
different vectors and the best dates
we can assign. You put it all in the
computer, and smoke comes out. No,
this one is different. This one has
seen us coming..."
241,CRAWFORD,241,"Talk about him, Starling. Tell me
what you see."
242,CLARICE,242,"He's a white male... Serial killers
tend to hunt within their own ethnic
group. And he's not a drifter - he's
got his own house, somewhere. Not an
apartment."
243,CRAWFORD,243,Why?
244,CLARICE,244,"What he does with them - takes
privacy... Time, tools... He's in
his 30's or 40's - he's got real
physical strength, but combined with
an older man's self-control. He's
cautious, precise, never impulsive...
This won't end in suicide, like they
often do."
245,CRAWFORD,245,Why not?
246,CLARICE,246,"He's got a real taste for it now.
And he's getting better at his work."
247,CRAWFORD,247,"Maybe you've got a knack for this...
I guess we're about to find out."
248,CLARICE,248,"Like I have a ""knack"" for Dr. Lecter?"
249,CRAWFORD,249,"Okay, Starling. Let's have it."
250,CLARICE,250,"You haven't said a word today about
that garage. Or what I found there."
251,CRAWFORD,251,"What should I say? You did fine work.
We'll wait on the lab."
252,CLARICE,252,"You knew. You knew from the start
that Lecter held the key to this...
But you weren't up front with me.
You sent me in to him naked."
253,CRAWFORD,253,Are you finished?
254,CLARICE,254,"He starts this - buzzing in me, in
my head. He makes me feel violated...
You used me, Mr. Crawford."
255,CRAWFORD,255,"Number One. Maybe there's a
connection, maybe not. Lying and
breathing are the same thing to
Lecter. Number Two. If I'd sent you
in there with something to hide from
him, he'd have known it, instantly.
He'd never have trusted you."
256,CRAWFORD,256,"Number Three, I didn't bring you
along today just because you can do
first-rate forensics. If Lecter is
becoming part of this case, you've
got the most current read on him.
And Number Four - you don't have to
like me, or the way I do things. But
you do have to keep a cool head.
Especially now... Because from here
on out, you'll know everything I do.
Are we straight on that?"
257,CRAWFORD,257,"You think about him long enough, you
get a feel for him... Then, if you're
lucky, out of all the stuff you know,
one little part of it tugs at you,
tries to get your attention... You
let me know when that happens,
Starling. Live right behind your
eyes, today. Don't try to impose any
patterns on this guy. Just stay open
and let him show you..."
258,CRAWFORD,258,"School's out, Starling."
259,CRAWFORD (V.O.),259,Starling...?
260,CRAWFORD,260,We're around back.
261,CRAWFORD,261,"Sheriff Perkins? Jack Crawford, FBI...
This is Officer Starling. We
appreciate your phoning us."
262,SHERIFF,262,"I didn't call you. That was somebody
from the state attorney's office...
'For you do a thing else, I'm gon'
find out if this girl's local. It
could just be somethin' that outside
elements has dumped on us."
263,CRAWFORD,263,"Well sir, that's where we can help.
If -"
264,SHERIFF,264,"I don't even know you, Mister... Now
we'll extend you ever courtesy, just
soon as we can, but for right now -"
265,CRAWFORD,265,"Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex
crime has some aspects I'd rather
discuss just between the two of us.
Know what I mean?"
266,SHERIFF,266,"Oscar, run fetch Dr. Akin from the
chapel. And tell Lamar to come on
when he's done playin' that music."
267,CRAWFORD,267,"I need a six-way linkup! Chicago,
Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis,
Atlanta, and Dallas... What?... Can
you hear me...?"
268,CLARICE,268,"Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen!
Listen here a minute, please. There's
things I need to do for her..."
269,CLARICE (O.S.),269,"Y'all brought her this far, and I
know her folks would thank you if
they could. Now please - go on out
and let me take care of her... Go
on, now."
270,CRAWFORD,270,"We're starting. Tell everybody to
stand by for fingerprint transmission."
271,CLARICE,271,Bill...
272,DR. AKIN,272,"Wrongful death... She'll have to go
to the state pathologist at Claxton
when you're done."
273,DR. AKIN,273,"I better - get on back for the rest
of that service. Lamar'll help you."
274,DR. AKIN,274,Lord almighty...
275,CRAWFORD,275,"What do you see, Starling?"
276,CLARICE,276,"Well, she's not local. Her ears are
pierced three times each, and she's
wearing green glitter nail polish.
Looks like town to me..."
277,CLARICE (O.S.),277,"She waxed her legs, I think... A big
girl, just like the others - but she
was careful about her appearance..."
278,CLARICE,278,"Two of the fingernails are broken
off, and there's - dirt or grit under
the others. She tried to claw her
way through something... I'll scrape
out samples after I've printed her."
279,LAMAR,279,"Them fishhooks are set too close
together. No wonder the Franklin
boys was scared to say they found
her."
280,CLARICE,280,Think they were runnin' a trotline?
281,CLARICE,281,"It's a Fish and Game violation. Like
poaching. There's a big fine."
282,LAMAR,282,Right... Are you from around here?
283,CLARICE,283,They do it lots of places.
284,CRAWFORD,284,"Get photos of her teeth. Then we'll
fax her fingerprints to Washington,
try to trace her through Missing
Persons."
285,CLARICE,285,She's got something in her throat.
286,LAMAR,286,"When a body comes out of the water,
alots of times there's like, leaves
and things in the mouth."
287,CRAWFORD,287,What is it - some kind of seed pod?
288,LAMAR,288,"Nawsir, that's a bug cocoon. But how
come that to get way down in there?
'Less somebody shoved it in..."
289,CRAWFORD,289,"She'll be easier to print if we turn
her over. Lamar, will you give me a
hand?"
290,LAMAR,290,"Yessir, I will. Clarice takes a jar
from her kit, carefully drops the
cocoon inside."
291,CRAWFORD (O.S.),291,Starling - what do you make of these?
292,CLARICE,292,"I don't know. I didn't see those on
any of the other girls..."
293,CRAWFORD,293,They weren't there. Get close-ups.
294,CLARICE,294,"Thanks, I'm not thirsty."
295,LAMAR,295,"No, hold it under your chin, there,
and on your temples. Cold'll make
you feel better. It does me."
296,CRAWFORD,296,"When I told that sheriff we shouldn't
talk in front of a woman, that really
burned you, didn't it?"
297,CRAWFORD,297,"That was just smoke, Starling, I had
to get rid of him. You did well in
there."
298,CLARICE,298,"It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other
cops know who you are. They look at
you to see how to act... It matters."
299,CRAWFORD,299,Point taken.
300,CRAWFORD,300,"When we get back, I want you to run
that bug by the Smithsonian, see if
they can identify it. Maybe it's got
some limited range, or it only breeds
at certain times of year... You found
it, Starling, you deserve the credit."
301,CLARICE,301,"I'm wondering if he's done that before -
placed a cocoon, or an insect. It
would be easy to miss in an autopsy,
especially with a floater... Can we
check back on that?"
302,CRAWFORD,302,"The other girls are in the ground.
Exhumations are upsetting for the
families. I'll do it if I have to,
but -"
303,CLARICE,303,"Then have the lab check Raspail's
head."
304,CLARICE,304,"Dr. Lecter's patient - have them
probe his soft-palette tissues...
They'll find another cocoon."
305,CRAWFORD,305,You seem pretty sure of that.
306,CLARICE,306,"Raspail was killed by the same man
who's killing these girls. And Lecter
knows him. Maybe even treated him...
You think so, too, don't you? Or
you'd never have sent me to that
asylum."
307,CRAWFORD,307,"Before we caught him, Lecter had a
big psychiatric practice in Baltimore.
But he traveled all over the country -
teaching, consulting... Christ, even
testifying in murder trials. Who
knows how many potential psychos he
turned loose, just for the fun of
it...?"
308,MR. GUMB,308,"Rub the cream on your skin. Rub it
in gooood..."
309,CATHERINE,309,"Mister... my family will pay cash.
Whatever ransom you're askin' for,
they -"
310,MR. GUMB,310,"Rub it in! Or you'll get the hose
again."
311,MR. GUMB,311,"Yes, it will, Precious, won't it? It
will get the hose!"
312,CATHERINE,312,Oh God... oh God...
313,CATHERINE,313,"Mister, if you let me go, I won't
press charges, I promise. You've
only had me here a couple days, and -"
314,MR. GUMB (O.S.),314,No. Just one day...
315,CATHERINE,315,"Is that all...? See - see, my mom is
a real important woman... Well, I
guess you already know that. She'll
pay you, no questions asked. Whatever
cause you represent - Iran, Palestine -
she'll see that -"
316,MR. GUMB,316,"Put the bottle in the basket. No
funny business, or you'll be sorry..."
317,ARDELIA,317,You better come see this.
318,TV ANCHOR (V.O.),318,"...was listed at first simply as a
missing person, but is now believed
to have been kidnapped by the serial
killer known only as ""Buffalo Bill."""
319,TV ANCHOR,319,"Memphis Police sources indicate that
the missing girl's blouse has been
identified, sliced up the back, in
what has become a kind of grim calling
card. Young Catherine Martin, as
we've said, is the only daughter of
U.S. Senator Ruth Martin -"
320,TV ANCHOR (O.S.),320,"...the Republican junior senator
from Tennessee. And while her
kidnapping is not at this point
considered to be politically
motivated, nevertheless it has stirred
the government -"
321,TV ANCHOR,321,"...to its highest levels, the
president himself being said to be,
and I quote, ""intensely concerned.""
Just moments ago, Senator Martin
made this dramatic personal plea..."
322,SEN. MARTIN,322,"I'm speaking now to the person who
is holding my daughter. Her name is
Catherine... You have the power to
let Catherine go, unharmed. She's
very gentle and kind - talk to her
and you'll see. Her name is
Catherine..."
323,CLARICE,323,"Boy, is that smart..."
324,ARDELIA,324,Why does she keep repeating the name?
325,CLARICE,325,"Somebody's coaching her... They're
trying to make him see Catherine as
a person - not just an object."
326,SEN. MARTIN,326,"You have a chance to show the whole
world that you can be merciful, as
well as strong. Please - I beg you -
release my Catherine..."
327,2ND TV ANCHOR (V.O.),327,"Meanwhile. in Memphis, the
investigation continued throughout
the night, as state and local
authorities were joined at the kidnap
scene by agents of the FBI..."
328,ARDELIA,328,"I don't know whether to say ""I'm
sorry,"" or ""Congratulations."" But
girl? - you just went prime time."
329,CRAWFORD,329,"I don't think he knew that she's a
Senator's child. She's a big girl,
Starling, like all the rest. We're
going on the theory she was randomly
targeted by size..."
330,CRAWFORD (V.O.),330,"By now, Bill's had her for 36 hours.
That leaves us just 36 more, before
he kills her... But maybe, just maybe,
Starling, we caught a real break
this time - thanks to you."
331,CRAWFORD (V.O.),331,"We found another bug, in Raspail's
head."
332,RODEN (V.O.),332,"Time, Pilch! My move."
333,PILCHER (V.O.),333,No fair! You lured him with produce.
334,RODEN,334,Tough noogies! It's still my turn.
335,CLARICE (O.S.),335,"If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that count?"
336,RODEN,336,Of course it counts. How do you play?
337,PILCHER,337,Officer Starling. Welcome back.
338,RODEN,338,"Where the hell did this one come
from? It's practically mush."
339,CLARICE,339,You really don't want to know.
340,PILCHER,340,"Your West Virginia specimen gave us
quite a bit of trouble, but I finally
managed to narrow his species through
chaetaxy - studying the skin."
341,RODEN,341,"I'm the one who found his perforating
proboscis! Are you wearing a gun,
right now?"
342,RODEN,342,"Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?"
343,PILCHER,343,Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
344,RODEN (O.S.),344,"The whole trick is to remove the
chrysalis without destroying it...
The wings are just like wet tissue
paper..."
345,PILCHER,345,"What do you do when you're not
detecting, Officer Starling?"
346,CLARICE,346,"I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher."
347,PILCHER,347,"Ever get out for cheeseburgers and
beer? The amusing house wine...?"
348,CLARICE,348,Not lately. But maybe someday.
349,RODEN,349,Positive match!
350,CLARICE,350,You're sure?
351,RODEN,351,"West Virginia... Baltimore. Officer
Starling, meet Mister Acherontia
Styx."
352,RODEN (O.S.),352,"Better known to his friends as the
Death's-head Moth..."
353,PILCHER (O.S.),353,"The Latin name comes from two rivers
in Hell. Your man - he drops these
girls into rivers, every time. Didn't
I read that?"
354,CLARICE,354,"And there's no way - no natural way -
these could've wound up in the bodies?"
355,PILCHER,355,"They live in Malaysia. In this
country, they'd have to be specially
raised, from imported eggs."
356,CLARICE,356,Dr. Lecter...
357,CRAWFORD (V.O.),357,"Maybe we can trace how he buys the
bugs, starting with U.S. Customs..."
358,CRAWFORD (O.S.),358,"Maybe we can locate some of Raspail's
old lovers. Maybe, someday..."
359,CRAWFORD,359,"But for Catherine Martin, it all
comes down to you and Lecter. You're
the one he talks to."
360,CLARICE,360,"He's already offered to help... What
would happen if we just showed our
cards - asked him for Bill?"
361,CRAWFORD,361,"He offered to help, Starling, not to
snitch. That wouldn't give him enough
chance to show off. Remember, Lecter
looks mainly for fun. Never forget
fun."
362,CLARICE,362,"But if he knew we have so little
time -"
363,CRAWFORD,363,"If we act too anxious, he'll make us
wait. He'll let the Senator keep
hoping, day after day, until Catherine
finally washes up. That'd be the
most fun of all."
364,CLARICE,364,"I think he means it, this time. I
think he'll deal."
365,CRAWFORD,365,What would it take?
366,CLARICE,366,"Transfer to a new prison. With a
view of trees, he said, or even
water... Can we swing that?"
367,CRAWFORD,367,"State to federal jurisdiction... We
can do it - eventually - but we'll
never get all the clearances in time.
Can you convince him a deal's already
in place?"
368,CLARICE,368,You'll back me up with some paperwork?
369,CLARICE,369,"Then I'll try. But wouldn't this
have more weight coming from the
Senator herself?"
370,CRAWFORD,370,"She doesn't know what we're up to.
And we can't afford to let her find
out."
371,CRAWFORD,371,"She's the mother, Starling. She can't
possibly comprehend what Lecter is.
She'd make the mistake of pleading
with him. Begging him... He'd feast
on her pain till the last second of
that girl's life..."
372,CRAWFORD (V.O.),372,"We can't trust Frederick Chilton,
either. He's greedy and ambitious.
If he knew about Lecter's link to
Bill, he's go straight to the
newspapers..."
373,CHILTON,373,"What you're doing, Miss Starling, is
coming into my hospital to conduct
an interview, and refusing to share
information with me. For the third
time!"
374,CLARICE,374,"Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is
just routine follow-up on the Raspail
case."
375,CHILTON,375,He's my patient! I have rights!
376,CHILTON,376,"I'm not just some turnkey, Miss
Starling. I shouldn't even be here
this afternoon. I had a ticket to
Holiday on Ice."
377,CLARICE,377,"I'm acting on instruction, Dr.
Chilton."
378,CLARICE,378,"This is the U.S. Attorney's number.
Now please - either discuss this
with him, or let me do my job."
379,DR. LECTER,379,"Wouldn't you say, Clarice, that for
a United States Senator, you're an
odd choice of messenger?"
380,CLARICE,380,"I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You
chose to speak to me. Would you prefer
someone else now? Or perhaps you
don't think you can help us."
381,DR. LECTER,381,"That is both impudent and untrue...
Tell me, how did you feel when you
viewed our Billy's latest effort?"
382,DR. LECTER,382,"Or should I say, his ""next-to-latest""?"
383,CLARICE,383,"By the book, he's a sadist."
384,DR. LECTER,384,"Life's too slippery for books,
Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from
the same God."
385,DR. LECTER,385,"Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was
she a large girl?"
386,CLARICE,386,Yes.
387,DR. LECTER,387,Big through the hips. Roomy.
388,CLARICE,388,They all were.
389,DR. LECTER,389,Mmm. And what else...?
390,CLARICE,390,"She had an insect deliberately
inserted in her throat. That hasn't
been made public yet. We don't know
what is means."
391,DR. LECTER,391,Was it a butterfly?
392,CLARICE,392,A moth... How did you predict that?
393,DR. LECTER,393,"I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice.
Enchant me."
394,CLARICE,394,"If you help us find Buffalo Bill in
time to save Catherine Martin, the
Senator promises you a transfer to
the V.A. hospital at Oneida Park,
New York, with a view of the woods
nearby. Maximum security still
applies, but you'd have reasonable
access to books."
395,CLARICE,395,"Best of all, though - one week a
year you'd get to leave the hospital
and go here."
396,CLARICE,396,"Plum Island. Every afternoon of that
week you can walk on the beach or
swim in the ocean for up to one hour.
Under SWAT team surveillance, of
course..."
397,CLARICE,397,"Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file,
copy of Senator Martin's terms. Her
offer is final and non-negotiable.
If Catherine dies -"
398,CLARICE,398,You get nothing.
399,DR. LECTER,399,"""Plum Island Animal Disease Research
Center."" Sounds charming."
400,CLARICE,400,"That's just part of the island. It
has a very nice beach. Terns nest
there."
401,DR. LECTER,401,"Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it
will be ""turns"" with us, too. Quid
pro quo. I tell you things, you tell
me things. Not about this case, though -
about yourself. Yes or no?"
402,DR. LECTER,402,"Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is
waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock..."
403,CLARICE,403,"Go, Doctor."
404,DR. LECTER,404,What's your worst memory of childhood?
405,DR. LECTER,405,"Quicker than that. I'm not interested
in your worst invention."
406,CLARICE,406,The death of my father.
407,DR. LECTER,407,"Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know."
408,CLARICE,408,"He was a town marshal... one night
he surprised two burglars, coming
out the back of a drugstore... They
shot him."
409,DR. LECTER,409,Killed outright?
410,CLARICE,410,"No. He was strong, he lasted almost
a month. My mother - died when I was
very young, so my father had become -
the whole world to me... After he
left me, I had nobody. I was ten
years old."
411,DR. LECTER,411,"You're very frank, Clarice. I think -
it would be quite something to know
you in private life."
412,CLARICE,412,"Quid pro quo, Doctor."
413,DR. LECTER,413,"The significance of the moth is
change. Caterpillar into cocoon into
beauty... Billy wants to change,
too, Clarice. But there's the problem
of his size, you see. Even if he
were a woman, he'd have to be a big
one..."
414,CLARICE,414,"Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation
in the literature between
transsexualism and violence.
Transsexuals are very passive."
415,DR. LECTER,415,"Clever girl. You're so close to the
way you're going to catch him - do
you realize that?"
416,CLARICE,416,No. Tell me why.
417,DR. LECTER,417,"After your father's death, you were
orphaned. What happened next?"
418,DR. LECTER,418,"I don't imagine the answer's on those
second-rate shoes, Clarice."
419,CLARICE,419,"I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana. They had
a ranch."
420,DR. LECTER,420,A cattle ranch?
421,CLARICE,421,Horses - and sheep...
422,DR. LECTER,422,How long did you live there?
423,CLARICE,423,Two months.
424,DR. LECTER,424,Why so briefly?
425,CLARICE,425,I - ran away...
426,DR. LECTER,426,"Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck
you?"
427,CLARICE,427,No.
428,DR. LECTER,428,Did he try to?
429,CLARICE,429,"No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor."
430,DR. LECTER,430,"Billy's not a real transsexual, but
he thinks he is. He tries to be.
He's tried to be a lot of things, I
expect."
431,CLARICE,431,"You said - I was very close to the
way we'd catch him."
432,DR. LECTER,432,"There are three major centers for
transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins,
the University of Minnesota, and
Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't
be surprised if Billy has applied
for sex reassignment at one or all
of them, and been rejected."
433,CLARICE,433,On what basis would they reject him?
434,DR. LECTER,434,"The personality inventories would
trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler,
House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't
test like a real transsexual."
435,CLARICE,435,How would he test?
436,DR. LECTER,436,"That's enough, I think. Happy hunting.
Oh, and Clarice - next time you will
tell me why you ran away. Shall I
summarize?"
437,CLARICE,437,"Yes, Doctor. Please."
438,DR. LECTER (V.O.),438,"You should try to obtain a list of
males rejected from all three gender
reassignment centers..."
439,DR. LECTER (V.O.),439,"Check first the ones rejected for
lying about criminal records..."
440,DR. LECTER (V.O.),440,"Among those who tried to conceal
their past, look for severe childhood
disturbances, associated with
violence... Possibly you'll find a
childhood incarceration... Then go
to their personality tests..."
441,DR. LECTER (V.O.),441,"Study their drawings, especially.
Billy's house drawings will show no
happy future... No baby carriage,
out in the yard. No pets, no toys,
no flowers, no sun..."
442,DR. LECTER (V.O.),442,"His females will be more crudely
sketched than him males - but he'll
compensate by adding exaggerated
adornments... jewelry, big breasts...
And his tree drawings - oh, his trees
will be frightful..."
443,DR. LECTER (V.O.),443,"Billy hates his own identity, he
always has - and he thinks that makes
him a transsexual. But his pathology
is a thousand times more savage...
He wants to be reborn, Clarice. He
will be reborn..."
444,CATHERINE (O.S.),444,Pleeeeeeeease.....!
445,CHILTON (V.O.),445,"Bad news, Hannibal..."
446,CHILTON (V.O.),446,"Gourmet magazine has rejected your
recipe for braised kidneys..."
447,CHILTON,447,"Perhaps you should have been less
specific about what kind."
448,CHILTON,448,"Stand him by the toilet. Then leave
us."
449,CHILTON,449,"Such a lot of correspondence! I can
hardly wait to analyze it in more
detail... But first things first."
450,CHILTON,450,"I thought she might be looking for a
civil rights violation in Migg's
death, so I bugged you... Not a word
to me in all these years, Hannibal.
Then Crawford sends his bit of fluff
over here, and you just turn to jelly.
It's too pathetic."
451,CHILTON,451,"You still think you're going to walk
on some beach, and see the birdies?
I don't think so, Hannibal... I called
Senator Ruth Martin, and she never
heard of any deal with you. She never
heard of Clarice Starling, either.
They scammed you, Hannibal..."
452,CHILTON,452,"When Crawford gets through milking
you, he's giving you to Baltimore
Homicide for the Raspail murder. And
they're preparing some special
surprises for you right now, in my
electroshock room."
453,CHILTON,453,"The Starling bitch wants you to rot
here, in this little box, till your
teeth fall out and you're soiling
diapers. You've seen the old ones,
Hannibal. They weep when their stewed
peaches get cold. That'll be you,
too. Unless - you trade with me."
454,CHILTON,454,"There never was a deal with Senator
Martin - but there is now. I've been
on the phone for hours, Hannibal, on
your behalf. Here's what you get: if
you identify Buffalo Bill, and the
girl is found in time, Senator Martin
will have you transferred to Brushy
Mountain State Prison, in Tennessee..."
455,CHILTON (O.S.),455,"The Governor has already agreed. You
get books, a view of the woods, and
plenty of exercise time..."
456,CHILTON (O.S.),456,"And best of all, you'd be out of
Jack Crawford's reach, forever. The
Senator will verify these terms on
the phone, and guarantee them in
writing..."
457,CHILTON (O.S.),457,"In exchange, I get your full
cooperation in publishing a
professional account of this - my
successful interviews with you. You
publish nothing. And I get exclusive
access to any material from Catherine
Martin... So. Do you accept my
demands?"
458,CHILTON (O.S.),458,"Answer me, Hannibal."
459,CHILTON,459,"You'll answer me now, or by God,
you'll answer to Baltimore Homicide.
Who is Buffalo Bill?"
460,DR. LECTER,460,"I'll tell the Senator herself. But
only in Tennessee..."
461,DR. DANIELSON,461,"I'm not having a witch hunt here,
Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent,
non-violent people with a real
problem."
462,CRAWFORD,462,"Dr. Danielson, the man we want was
never your patient. It would be
someone you refused because he tries
to conceal a record of criminal
violence. Please, Doctor - time is
eating us up. Just show me the ones
you've turned away."
463,DR. DANIELSON,463,"Examination and interview materials
are confidential. We've never violated
an applicant's trust, and we never
will."
464,CRAWFORD,464,"You want to see a violation? This is
a violation..."
465,CRAWFORD,465,"Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg,
she was just ID'd. I met her on a
slab in West Virginia. And sometime
tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's
going to do the same thing to
Catherine Martin."
466,DR. DANIELSON,466,"That's a childish, bullying stunt,
Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield
surgeon, so you can put away your
picture."
467,BURROUGHS,467,"Phone, Jack. Director Burke."
468,CRAWFORD,468,In a minute!
469,CRAWFORD,469,"Look... search your own records, if
you prefer. You can do it a lot faster
than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo
Bill through your information, I'll
suppress it. Nobody has to know this
hospital cooperated."
470,DR. DANIELSON,470,"I doubt very much that the FBI or
any other government agency can keep
a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will
out... And then what? Will you give
Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a
big pair of sunglasses on this
building, and a funny nose?"
471,CRAWFORD,471,"Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson.
Very humorous. You like the truth?
Try this."
472,CRAWFORD,472,"He kidnaps young women and kills
them and rips their skin off. We
don't want him to do that anymore.
If you don't help me, just as fast
as you can, then the Justice
Department is going to ask publicly
for a court order, We'll ask twice a
day, just in time for the morning
and evening news. And each one of
our press conferences will focus on
Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins,
and how we're still hoping for his
cooperation. And every time there's
any news on the case - when Catherine
Martin floats, when the next one
floats, and the next one - why, we'll
just issue another press release
about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over
at Johns Hopkins - complete with all
his humorous fucking remarks."
473,DR. DANIELSON,473,"It may be that - I could confer with
my colleagues on this. And get back
to you."
474,CRAWFORD,474,"Would you, Doctor? That would be so
kind."
475,CRAWFORD,475,Transferred...?
476,DIRECTOR BURKE,476,"Already airborne for Memphis. Senator
Martin's meeting him at the airport."
477,DIRECTOR BURKE,477,"Jack - did you make some sort of
promise to Lecter, in the Senator's
name?"
478,DIRECTOR BURKE,478,"We're going to have to talk about
this, Jack. The Senator's mad as
hell. Paul Krendler's over here from
Justice, she's asking him to take
charge in Memphis... I know that...
But you're still in command of the
task force, and Lecter's plane can
still be ordered back. It's your
call, Jack - but I want it now."
479,CRAWFORD,479,Let him land.
480,CLARICE,480,"Chilton has killed her, hasn't he?
That slimy little bastard! We were
so close with Lecter - and now her
last chance is gone."
481,CRAWFORD,481,Let's get some coffee and talk.
482,CLARICE,482,"Are you in trouble over this, Mr.
Crawford? Can Senator Martin do
something to you?"
483,CRAWFORD,483,"I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy
Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have
to retire in two years. It's not a
consideration. But you are..."
484,CRAWFORD,484,"You've done enough. If I keep you
out of school any longer, you'll be
recycled. Cost you six months, at
least. I can guarantee you readmission
here, but that's about it."
485,CRAWFORD,485,"Now's your chance, Starling. Go back
to class. Leave Bill to me."
486,CLARICE,486,"If you didn't want me chasing him,
you shouldn't have taken me to that
funeral home."
487,CLARICE,487,"Lecter is still the key, I know he
is. Whatever he told me about Bill
is just as good now as it was before."
488,CRAWFORD,488,"Or just as worthless. But I want you
in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when
he gets tired of toying with Senator
Martin, he'll talk to you again.
There's a plane waiting for you now
at the airstrip."
489,CLARICE,489,"I lied to Lecter. I'll need some
kind of peace offering... Can I get
the drawings from his cell?"
490,CRAWFORD,490,"Good idea. Meantime, try to get a
feel for Catherine Martin. Her
apartment, her friends... how he
might've stalked her. I'm going to
the other two clinics, Minnesota and
Ohio."
491,CRAWFORD,491,"Now's the hardest part, Starling.
Use your anger, don't let it keep
you from thinking. Just keep your
eyes on Catherine. We've got less
than 30 hours."
492,CLARICE,492,"Mr. Crawford... can those cops down
there handle Dr. Lecter?"
493,CRAWFORD,493,"They'll use their best men. But they
better be paying attention..."
494,CRAWFORD (V.O.),494,He will...
495,BOYLE,495,"Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter. I'm
Officer Boyle, this is Officer Pembry.
We aim to treat you just as nice as
you treat us. Act like a gentlemen,
you'll get three hots and a cot."
496,PEMBRY,496,"But we ain't pussy-footin' with you,
buddy ruff. You get cute, try to
bite somebody? - we'll tie your
asshole in a knot. You savvy?"
497,DR. LECTER,497,"Oh yes, Officer Pembry. I certainly
do."
498,PEMBRY,498,"Shit, he's just an ol' broke-dick.
Won't be no trouble as all if he
don't flip out."
499,BOYLE,499,Dr. Chilton...?
500,BOYLE,500,"If you'll please sign right here,
sir, we'll have us a legal transfer."
501,BOYLE,501,Use mine.
502,PEMBRY,502,Here they come.
503,CHILTON,503,"Senator Martin, meet Dr. Hannibal
Lecter."
504,SEN. MARTIN,504,"Dr. Lecter, I've brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights... You'll
want to read it before I sign."
505,DR. LECTER,505,"I won't waste your time and
Catherine's time bargaining for petty
privileges. Clarice Starling and
that awful Jack Crawford have wasted
far too much already. I only pray
they haven't doomed the poor girl...
Let me help you now, and I'll trust
you when it's all over."
506,SEN. MARTIN,506,You have my word. Paul?
507,DR. LECTER,507,"Buffalo Bill's real name is William
Rubin. I met him just once. He was
referred to me in April or May, 1980,
by my patient Benjamin Raspail. They
were lovers, but Raspail had become
very frightened. Apparently Rubin
had murdered a transient, and - done
things with the skin. He thought if
I could cure Billy, then Billy'd be
safe from the police, and he's be
safe from Billy... Obviously, he was
wrong."
508,KRENDLER,508,"We need his address, a physical descr-"
509,DR. LECTER,509,Did you nurse Catherine?
510,SEN. MARTIN,510,What...?
511,DR. LECTER,511,Did you breast-feed her?
512,KRENDLER,512,You son-of-a -
513,SEN. MARTIN,513,Yes... I did.
514,DR. LECTER,514,"Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?"
515,DR. LECTER,515,"Six foot one, strongly built, about
190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale
blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said
he lived in Philadelphia, but may
have lied. That's really all I can
remember, Senator - but if I think
of any more, I'll let you know."
516,SEN. MARTIN,516,Let's go with it.
517,DR. LECTER,517,"Senator Martin...! You can't trust
Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling.
It's such a game with these people.
They're determined to get the arrest
for themselves. The ""collar,"" I think
they say."
518,SEN. MARTIN,518,"Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in
mind."
519,DR. LECTER,519,"Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit."
520,CATHERINE (O.S.),520,"Close enough to fuck is close enough
to fight..."
521,CATHERINE,521,"Get my legs round your neck, you
goddamn creep, I'll send you home to
Jesus..."
522,CATHERINE,522,"Okay, Precious. Time for a treat..."
523,CATHERINE,523,"Preeeeecious...! C'mon, boy, nice
yummy bone... c'mon, you little
shit..."
524,CATHERINE,524,"Hang on, boy... hang on..."
525,CATHERINE,525,Nooooo...!
526,SEN. MARTIN,526,"Who are you, please? I thought the
police were through in here."
527,CLARICE,527,"I'm Clarice Starling, Senator. FBI."
528,SEN. MARTIN,528,Clarice Starling...
529,SEN. MARTIN,529,"Paul? Would you come in here,
please...?"
530,SEN. MARTIN,530,"Miss Starling, you may know the Deputy
Attorney General, Mr. Krendler. Paul,
this is the trainee that Jack Crawford
sent to Lecter... She lied to him,
pretending to have my authority, and
thus jeopardized this entire
investigation. Now she has the further
gall to invade my daughter's privacy,
again without permission. If her
little games have killed my baby..."
531,KRENDLER,531,"You're out of line, Starling, and
you're off this case. Back to
Quantico."
532,CLARICE,532,"Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -"
533,KRENDLER,533,"Your instructions are what I'm giving
you now. Jack Crawford answers to
the Director, and the Director answers
to me. My God, Crawford's losing
it...! He shouldn't even be on this,
with his wife sick as she is... How
the hell did you get in here, anyway?
He gave you - what? Some kind of
special ID? Let's have it."
534,CLARICE,534,"I need the ID to fly with my gun.
The gun belongs in Quantico."
535,KRENDLER,535,"Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon
as you get back. The gun, too. Be on
the next plane, Starling, there's
one in 90 minutes."
536,CLARICE,536,"Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts
me. Or at least, he used to. If I
could just -"
537,KRENDLER,537,"Lecter has already named Buffalo
Bill."
538,KRENDLER,538,"He gave us a perfectly good
description, and we're on it now, so
we won't be needing your little
novelty act any longer - or his,
either. He's under close guard at
the courthouse, pending a prison
transfer. The next plane, Officer."
539,CLARICE,539,"Sir, doesn't this ""William Rubin""
strike you as - I don't know - kind
of vague?"
540,KRENDLER,540,"Do you need a police escort, Starling?
Or do you think you can find the
airport by yourself?"
541,CLARICE,541,Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
542,SGT. TATE,542,Are you with Mr. Krendler's people?
543,CLARICE,543,I just left him.
544,SGT. TATE,544,"Access to Lecter is strictly limited.
We've been getting death threats."
545,SGT. TATE,545,"Log in, and check your weapon."
546,MURRAY (V.O.),546,"Shoot, we haven't had this kinda
security since the President came
through town..."
547,MURRAY,547,"Every cop in Tennessee wants a look
at this guy. 'Sit true what they're
sayin' - he's some kinda vampire?"
548,CLARICE,548,I don't have a name for what he is.
549,PEMBRY,549,"You know the rules, ma'am?"
550,CLARICE,550,"Yes, Officer Pembry. I've questioned
him before."
551,DR. LECTER,551,"Good afternoon, Clarice."
552,CLARICE,552,"I thought you might want your drawings
back... Just until you get your view."
553,DR. LECTER,553,"How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford
send you here for one last wheedle -
before you're both booted off the
case?"
554,CLARICE,554,Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
555,DR. LECTER,555,People will say we're in love.
556,DR. LECTER,556,"Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it?
Pity for poor Catherine. Tick-tock..."
557,CLARICE,557,"Dr. Lecter, you find out everything.
You couldn't have talked with this
""William Rubin"", even once, and come
out knowing so little about him...
You made him up, didn't you?"
558,DR. LECTER,558,"Clarice... you're hardly in a position
to accuse me of lying."
559,CLARICE,559,"I think you were telling me the truth
in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell
me the rest now."
560,DR. LECTER,560,"I've studied the case file, have
you...? Everything you need to find
him is right in these pages. Whatever
his name is."
561,CLARICE,561,Then tell me how.
562,DR. LECTER,562,"First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.
Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each
particular thing, ask: What is it,
in itself, what is its nature...?
What does he do, this man you seek?"
563,CLARICE,563,He kills w-
564,DR. LECTER,564,No! That's incidental.
565,DR. LECTER,565,"What is the first and principal thing
he does, what need does he serve by
killing?"
566,CLARICE,566,"Anger, social resentment, sexual
frus-"
567,DR. LECTER,567,"No, he covets. That's his nature.
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?
Do we seek out things to covet? Make
an effort to answer."
568,CLARICE,568,No. We just -
569,DR. LECTER,569,"No. Precisely. We begin by coveting
what we see every day. Don't you
feel eyes moving over your body,
Clarice? I hardly see how you
couldn't. And don't your eyes move
over the things you want?"
570,CLARICE,570,"All right, then tell me how -"
571,DR. LECTER,571,"No. It's your turn to tell me,
Clarice. You don't have any more
vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island.
Why did you run away from that ranch?"
572,CLARICE,572,"Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -"
573,DR. LECTER,573,"We don't reckon time the same way,
Clarice. This is all the time you'll
ever have."
574,CLARICE,574,"Later, listen, I'll -"
575,DR. LECTER,575,"I'll listen now. After your father's
murder, you were orphaned. You were
ten years old. You went to live with
cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch
in Montana. And - ?"
576,CLARICE,576,And - one morning I just - ran away...
577,DR. LECTER,577,"Not ""just,"" Clarice. What set you
off? You started what time?"
578,CLARICE,578,Early. Still dark.
579,DR. LECTER,579,"Then something woke you. What? Did
you dream...? What was it?"
580,CLARICE (V.O.),580,I heard a strange sound...
581,DR. LECTER (V.O.),581,What was it?
582,CLARICE (V.O.),582,I didn't know. I went to look...
583,CLARICE (V.O.),583,"Screaming! Some kind of - screaming.
Like a child's voice..."
584,DR. LECTER (V.O.),584,What did you do?
585,CLARICE (V.O.),585,"Got dressed without turning on the
light. I went downstairs... outside..."
586,CLARICE (V.O.),586,"I crept up to the barn... I was so
scared to look inside - but I had
to..."
587,DR. LECTER (V.O.),587,"And what did you see, Clarice?"
588,CLARICE (V.O.),588,Lambs. The lambs were screaming...
589,DR. LECTER,589,"They were slaughtering the spring
lambs?"
590,CLARICE,590,Yes...! They were screaming.
591,DR. LECTER,591,So you ran away...
592,CLARICE,592,"No. First I tried to free them... I
opened the gate of their pen - but
they wouldn't run. They just stood
there, confused. They wouldn't run..."
593,DR. LECTER,593,But you could. You did.
594,CLARICE,594,"I took one lamb. And I ran away, as
fast as I could..."
595,DR. LECTER (V.O.),595,Where were you going?
596,CLARICE (V.O.),596,"I don't know. I had no food or water.
It was very cold. I thought - if I
can even save just one... but he got
so heavy. So heavy..."
597,CLARICE (V.O.),597,"I didn't get more than a few miles
before the sheriff's car found me.
The rancher was so angry he sent me
to live at the Lutheran orphanage in
Bozeman. I never saw the ranch
again..."
598,DR. LECTER (V.O.),598,But what became of your lamb?
599,DR. LECTER (V.O.),599,Clarice...?
600,DR. LECTER,600,"You still wake up sometimes, don't
you? Wake up in the dark, with the
lambs screaming?"
601,CLARICE,601,Yes...
602,DR. LECTER,602,"Do you think if you saved Catherine,
you could make them stop...? Do you
think, if Catherine lives, you won't
wake up in the dark, ever again, to
the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?"
603,CLARICE,603,Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
604,DR. LECTER,604,"Thank you, Clarice."
605,CLARICE,605,"Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter."
606,DR. LECTER,606,"Dr. Chilton... I believe you know
each other?"
607,CHILTON,607,Out. Let's go.
608,PEMBRY,608,"Sorry, ma'a m - we've got orders to
have you put on a place."
609,DR. LECTER,609,"Brave Clarice. Will you let me know
if ever the lambs stop screaming?"
610,CLARICE,610,Yes. I'll tell you.
611,DR. LECTER,611,Promise...?
612,DR. LECTER,612,"Then why not take your case file? I
won't be needing it anymore."
613,DR. LECTER,613,"Good-bye, Clarice."
614,FOREMAN,614,"Hello, dear! Punctual as always. And
what have you brought us today?"
615,FOREMAN,615,"Oh, marvelous... You know, I always
say you're the Leonardo of leather."
616,MR. GUMB (O.S.),616,Oil.
617,FOREMAN,617,Pardon...?
618,MR. GUMB (O.S.),618,You're leaving oil on the skin.
619,FOREMAN,619,Of course... You'll be wanting your -
620,FOREMAN,620,I wish we had a dozen like him...
621,PEMBRY,621,"Ready when you are, Doc!"
622,DR. LECTER (O.S.),622,"Just another minute, please!"
623,PEMBRY,623,"Sumbitch demanded lamb chops for
dinner, extra rare."
624,BOYLE,624,"What you reckon he'll want for
breakfast - some fuckin' thing from
the zoo?"
625,PEMBRY,625,"Okay, Doc, grab some floor. Same
drill as lunchtime."
626,DR. LECTER,626,"I'm ready when you are, Officer
Pembry."
627,SGT. TATE,627,"What is this shit...? Did somebody
go up to five?"
628,SGT. TATE,628,"Call Pembry, ask him what -"
629,SGT. TATE,629,"CP, shots fired on five! Repeat,
shots fires on five! Outside posts
look sharp, we've got a... Ho-ly
shit."
630,SGT. TATE,630,"SHUT UP...! Guard mount, double up
on your outside posts. Bobby, get
the vests. Rainey, Howard, cover
that fucking elevator if it comes
all the way to -"
631,A COP (O.S.),631,It stopped!
632,SGT. TATE,632,"Seal off a ten-block radius. Get me
the SWAT team and an ambulance, double
quick. We're going up."
633,SGT. TATE,633,Pembry? Boyle...?
634,SGT. TATE,634,Oh no... no...
635,SGT. TATE,635,Command post... Two offi-
636,SGT. TATE,636,"Two officers down. Prisoner is
missing. Repeat, Lecter is missing...
He's stripped the bed, might be making
a rope, check all windows. Where the
fuck is my ambulance?"
637,JACOBS,637,"Boyle is dead, Sarge. His gun's
gone..."
638,MURRAY,638,This one's alive!
639,SGT. TATE,639,"Take ahold of him where he can feel
your hands, son. Talk to him."
640,MURRAY,640,"What's his name, Sarge?"
641,SGT. TATE,641,"It's Pembry, now talk to him, God
dammit."
642,SGT. TATE,642,"Boyle's dead, Pembry's read bad.
Lecter is missing and armed - he
took Boyle's gun..."
643,SGT. TATE,643,"Pembry got off one round - there's a
chance Lecter was hit. We heard a
total of three shots fired, so he's
got four left... He's got a knife,
too."
644,MURRAY,644,"You're just fine, Pembry, lookin'
good, buddy, you're gonna make it..."
645,ORDERLY,645,Downstairs - let's go!
646,SGT. TATE,646,"Ten-four, Lieutenant. I'm on the
elevator, bringing it down. Pembry
and Boyle are both cleared, top three
floors secured, main stairwell
secured. He's somewhere on -"
647,SGT. TATE,647,"Uh, we're pretty sure he's somewhere
on two, sir... That's all for now,
over."
648,SGT. TATE,648,He's on the roof of the elevator!
649,PETERSON,649,"I see him... There's a weapon by his
hand. He's not moving..."
650,RADIO VOICE,650,Can you get the drop?
651,PETERSON,651,We got the drop.
652,RADIO VOICE,652,One warning. Then take him out.
653,PETERSON,653,Quinn!! put your hands on your head!!
654,PETERSON,654,Put one in his leg.
655,PETERSON,655,No movement.
656,RADIO VOICE,656,"Okay, Johnny, hold your fire..."
657,SWAT COMMANDER,657,"We're coming into the car, we're
opening the hatch. Watch his hands.
Any fire will come from us. Affirm?"
658,PETERSON'S VOICE,658,Got it.
659,SGT. TATE,659,That's Pembry!
660,ATTENDANT,660,"He's comatose, but his vital signs
are good. Pressure's 130 over 90...
Yeah, 90! Pulse 85..."
661,ATTENDANT,661,"His convulsions have stopped, but
he's got so much loose skin on his
face, it's hard to tell if -"
662,ARDELIA (V.O.),662,They found the ambulance...
663,ARDELIA,663,"In the parking garage at Memphis
airport. The crew was dead. He killed
a tourist, too. Got his clothes,
cash... By now he could be anywhere."
664,CLARICE,664,No. He won't come after me.
665,ARDELIA,665,Why not?
666,CLARICE,666,"It would be rude. And he wouldn't
get to ask any more questions..."
667,ARDELIA,667,"Clarice - you did the best anybody
could have for Catherine Martin. You
stuck your neck out for her and you
got your butt kicked for her and you
tried. It's not your fault it ended
this way."
668,CLARICE,668,"The worst part - the thing that's
making me crazy - is that Bill is
right in front of me. Only I can't
see him..."
669,CLARICE,669,"Lecter said, everything I need to
catch him is right here, in these
pages..."
670,ARDELIA,670,Lecter said a lot of things.
671,CLARICE,671,"He's here, Ardelia."
672,ARDELIA,672,"Hey, is this Lecter's handwriting?
She holds up the map, with its
location markings for the kidnapping
and body dump sites. Clarice takes
it, looks."
673,DR. LECTER (V.O.),673,"Clarice, doesn't this random
scattering of sites seem overdone to
you? Doesn't it seem desperately
random - like the elaborations of a
bad liar? Ta... Hannibal Lecter."
674,CLARICE,674,"""Desperately random."" What does he
mean?"
675,ARDELIA,675,"Not random at all, maybe. Like there's
some pattern here...?"
676,CLARICE,676,"But there is no pattern. There's no
connection at all among these places,
or the computers would've nailed it!
They're even found in random order."
677,ARDELIA,677,"Well, except for the one girl."
678,CLARICE,678,What girl?
679,ARDELIA,679,"The one that was weighted down. Where
is she...? Fred something."
680,CLARICE,680,"Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere,
Ohio. The first girl taken, but the
third body found... Why?"
681,ARDELIA,681,"'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted
her down."
682,CLARICE,682,But why? He didn't weight the others.
683,CLARICE,683,"The first, what the hell did Lecter
say about... ""First principles,"" he
said. Simplicity... What does this
guy do, he ""covets."" How do we first
start to covet? ""We covet what we
see -"""
684,CLARICE,684,"""- every day."""
685,ARDELIA,685,"Hot damn, Clarice."
686,CLARICE (V.O.),686,He knew her...!
687,CLARICE,687,"Maybe he lives in this, this
Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw
her every day, and killed her sort
of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant
to... give her a 7-Up and talk about
the choir. But then -"
688,KRENDLER,688,Starling -
689,CLARICE,689,"But then he had to cover up, make
her seem just like all the rest of
them. That's what Lecter was hinting!"
690,KRENDLER,690,"The market in Lecter hints is way
down, today, okay? I've got two good
men dead in Memphis, and three
civilians. I've got -"
691,CRAWFORD,691,Who the hell's fault is -
692,KRENDLER,692,"- a U.S. Senator who's half out of
her head because her daughter's going
to be murdered today! And all because
of your mind games with fucking
Lecter!"
693,CRAWFORD,693,"If you hadn't interfered, he'd still
be in custody in Baltimore!"
694,BURKE,694,Jack -
695,KRENDLER,695,"You sent in a green recruit, with a
phony goddamn offer -"
696,CRAWFORD,696,"You're just trying to cover your ass
for letting him escape!"
697,BURKE,697,THAT'S ENOUGH! All of you...
698,BURKE,698,"Starling, I'm afraid I have no choice.
You're suspended from the Academy."
699,BURKE,699,Not another word!
700,BURKE,700,"This is pending a reevaluation of
your fitness for the service. I
promise you'll get a fair hearing."
701,BURKE,701,"Jack... you're ordered to take
compassionate leave. You'll spend
the rest of the day briefing the
AG's office, then transfer command
of the task force, effective by 1800
hours."
702,BURKE,702,"I'm sorry, Jack... Go home. Take
care of Bella."
703,CLARICE,703,"All his victims are women... His
obsession is women, he lives to hunt
women. But not one women is hunting
him - except me. I can walk in a
woman's room and know three times as
much about her as a man would."
704,CLARICE,704,I have to go to Belvedere.
705,CRAWFORD,705,"You heard them. I don't have that
authority anymore."
706,CLARICE,706,You do until six p.m.
707,CRAWFORD,707,"Ohio is cold ground. Picked over,
ten months ago. Our people worked
it, so did the locals."
708,CLARICE,708,"But not from this angle. Not thinking
he knew her. You've got to send me!"
709,CRAWFORD,709,"I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I
won't disobey orders, not even now."
710,CLARICE,710,"But I just became a private citizen.
I can go anywhere I want to."
711,CRAWFORD,711,"With ID and a gun...? Impersonating
a federal agent is a felony."
712,CLARICE,712,"He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford.
This morning, or maybe at noon, but
today, and Belvedere's our last
chance. I'm flying there, right now,
unless you stop me. You want my ID?
Here - take it..."
713,CRAWFORD,713,"There's about $300 here... And a
hotline code number. They'll patch
you through to me, wherever I am."
714,CLARICE,714,Thank you.
715,MR. GUMB (O.S.),715,Preeeeecious...!
716,MR. GUMB (O.S.),716,"Precious, come on Precious! Busy
busy day today..."
717,MR. GUMB (O.S.),717,Momma's gonna be sooo beautiful!
718,MR. GUMB (O.S.),718,"You come here this minute, you little
scamp!"
719,MR. GUMB,719,Precious...?
720,MR. GUMB,720,Sweetheart...?
721,CATHERINE (O.S.),721,She'd down here you sack of shit.
722,MR. GUMB,722,"Precious, are you all right?"
723,CATHERINE,723,"Get me a telephone. Lower it down to
me. Do it now, mister! I don't want
to have to hurt this little dog."
724,CATHERINE,724,"You shoot motherfucker you better
kill me quick or I'll break her
fucking neck, I swear to God!"
725,MR. GUMB (O.S.),725,Nooooooo!
726,CATHERINE,726,"Back off, you son of a bitch! Back
off!"
727,CATHERINE,727,"That's better... Now get me a live
telephone. Get a long extension and
lower is down here... And you better
do it fast, too, 'cause I think her
leg's broken. She's in pain, mister,
she needs a vet."
728,MR. GUMB,728,"You think she's in pain? You don't
know what pain is. But you're going
to find out..."
729,CLARICE,729,Mr. Bimmel...?
730,MR. BIMMEL,730,"I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.
The police been back here so many
times already... Fredrica went into
Columbus on the bus to see about a
job. She left the interview OK. She
never come home."
731,MR. BIMMEL,731,"Her room's how she left it. Just
shut the door when you're done."
732,DR. LECTER (V.O.),732,"Billy wants to change, too, Clarice.
But there's the problem of his size,
you see..."
733,DR. LECTER (V.O.),733,"Even if he were a woman, he'd have
to be a big one..."
734,CLARICE,734,Sewing darts. You bastard.
735,CLARICE,735,"He's making himself a ""woman suit,""
Mr. Crawford - out of real women!
And he can sew, this guy, he's really
skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -"
736,CRAWFORD (V.O.),736,Starling -
737,CLARICE,737,"That's why they're all so big -
because he needs a lot of skin! He
keeps them alive to starve them awhile -
to loosen their skin, so that -"
738,CRAWFORD (V.O.),738,"Starling, we know who he is! And
where he is. We're on our way now."
739,CLARICE,739,Where?
740,CRAWFORD,740,"Calumet City, edge of Chicago. I'll
be on the ground in 45 minutes with
the Hostage Rescue Team. I'm back in
charge, Starling. He's mine."
741,CLARICE,741,"Sir, that's great news. But how -"
742,CRAWFORD,742,"Johns Hopkins finally came up with a
name for us. We fed him into Known
Offenders, and he came up cherries."
743,CRAWFORD,743,"Subject's name is ""Jamie Gumb,"" AKA
""John Grant."" Lecter's description
was accurate, he just lied about the
name."
744,CRAWFORD (O.S.),744,"This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered
both his grandparents when he was
twelve, and did nine years in juvenile
psychiatric. Where, Starling, he
took vocational rehab, and learned a
useful trade..."
745,CLARICE,745,Sewing...
746,CRAWFORD,746,"Take a bow. Customs had some paper
on his alias. They stopped a carton
two years ago at LAX - live
caterpillars from Surinam. The
addressee was ""John Grant."" Calumet
Power & Light's given us two possible
residences under that alias. We're
hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking
the other."
747,CLARICE,747,"Chicago's only about 400 miles from
here. I could be there in -"
748,CRAWFORD,748,"No, Starling, there isn't time. And
you've still got crucial work to do
in Ohio. We want him for murder, not
kidnapping. I'm counting on you to
link him to the Bimmel girl, before
he's indicted."
749,CLARICE,749,Yes sir... I'll do my best.
750,CRAWFORD,750,"Starling - you've earned back your
place in the Academy. We never
would've found him without you, and
nobody's ever going to forget that.
Least of all me."
751,CLARICE,751,"Yes sir. Thank you, sir..."
752,BURROUGHS (O.S.),752,"Here he comes, Jack."
753,CLARICE,753,"Mr. Bimmel... did Fredrica ever
mention a man named Jamie Gumb, from
Calumet City? Or John Grant?"
754,CLARICE,754,Did she know any men that sew?
755,MR. BIMMEL,755,"She sewed for everybody. Stores,
ladies, whatever. I don't know about
men."
756,CLARICE,756,"Who was her best friend, Mr. Bimmel?
Who'd she hang out with?"
757,STACY (V.O.),757,"Freaked me out. Get your skin peeled
off, is that a bummer...?"
758,STACY,758,"They said she was just rags, like
somebody -"
759,CLARICE,759,"Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a
man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?"
760,CLARICE,760,"Do you think she could've had a friend
you didn't know about?"
761,STACY,761,"No way. She had a guy, I'da known,
believe me. Sewing was her life, she
was really great at it. Poor Freddie."
762,CLARICE,762,Did you ever work with her?
763,STACY,763,"Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to
help her do alterations for old Mrs.
Lippman. Lots of people worked for
her, she had the business from all
these retail stores? But she was
like, totally old, it was more'n she
could handle."
764,CLARICE,764,"Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd
like to talk to her."
765,STACY,765,"She died. She went to Florida to
retire, like two years ago? She dies
own there."
766,STACY,766,"Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?"
767,CLARICE,767,I think so.
768,STACY,768,"You get to travel around and stuff?
I mean, better places then this?"
769,CLARICE,769,Sometimes you do.
770,STACY,770,"Freddie was so happy for me when I
got this job. This - toaster
giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the
speakers all day - she thought this
was really hot shit. What did she
know, big dummy..."
771,CLARICE,771,"Good afternoon... I wonder if you
could help me. I'm looking for Mrs.
Lippman's family?"
772,MR. GUMB,772,They don't live here anymore.
773,CLARICE,773,"Excuse me, but I really do need to
talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's
house. Did you know her?"
774,MR. GUMB,774,"Just briefly. What's the problem,
Officer?"
775,CLARICE,775,"I'm investigating the death of
Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?"
776,MR. GUMB,776,Jack Gordon.
777,CLARICE,777,"Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica
when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?"
778,MR. GUMB,778,"No. Wait... Was she a great, fat
person? I may have seen her, I'm not
sure..."
779,MR. GUMB,779,"Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he
could help you. I have his card
somewhere. Do you mind stepping
inside, while I looks for it?"
780,CLARICE,780,Thanks.
781,CRAWFORD,781,Clarice.
782,MR. GUMB (O.S.),782,"That horrible business, I shiver
every time I think about it..."
783,MR. GUMB,783,"Are they close to catching somebody,
do you think?"
784,CLARICE,784,"I think we may be, yes."
785,CLARICE,785,"Mr. Gordon, did you take over this
place after Mrs. Lippman died?"
786,MR. GUMB,786,"Yes. I bought the house from her,
two years ago."
787,CLARICE,787,"Did she leave any records here? Tax
or business records? Maybe a list of
employees?"
788,MR. GUMB,788,"No, nothing at all. Has the FBI
learned something? Because the police
here don't seem to have the first
clue..."
789,MR. GUMB,789,"Do you have his description yet, or
some fingerprints...?"
790,CLARICE,790,"No... no, we don't."
791,MR. GUMB,791,Ahhh. Here's that number.
792,CLARICE,792,"Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you
have a phone I can use?"
793,MR. GUMB,793,In the kitchen. I'll show you.
794,CLARICE,794,Freeze!
795,CLARICE,795,"Okay... Okay, Mr. Gumb, you're under
arrest. Down on the floor, hands and
legs spread, move it."
796,CLARICE,796,Shit!
797,CLARICE,797,"FBI, Catherine, you're safe."
798,CATHERINE,798,"Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout.
GET ME OUT!"
799,CLARICE,799,You're all right! Where is he?
800,CATHERINE,800,Get me out!
801,CLARICE,801,"I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I
can hear. Shut that dog up."
802,CLARICE,802,Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
803,CATHERINE,803,I don't know! Get me out!!
804,CLARICE,804,"Catherine. Listen to me. I have to
find a rope. I have to leave this
room, just for a minute, but -"
805,CATHERINE,805,"NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you
LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU"
806,CLARICE,806,Shut UP!
807,CLARICE,807,"The other officers will be here any
minute! you're perfectly safe now!"
808,CRAWFORD,808,Starling... your father sees you.
809,DIRECTOR BURKE (V.O.),809,"Congratulations! You are now officers
of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation..."
810,ARDELIA,810,Agent Starling! Telephone!
811,CLARICE,811,Agent Mapp! Thank you!
812,RODEN,812,"Hel-lo, gorgeous! Let's get down."
813,PILCHER,813,Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
814,CLARICE,814,Starling.
815,DR. LECTER (V.O.),815,"Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped
screaming...?"
816,DR. LECTER (V.O.),816,"Don't bother with a trace, I won't
be on long enough."
817,CLARICE,817,"Where are you, Dr. Lecter?"
818,DR. LECTER (O.S.),818,"Where I have a view, Clarice..."
819,DR. LECTER (O.S.),819,"Orion is looking splendid tonight,
and Arcturus, the Herdsman, with his
flock..."
820,DR. LECTER,820,"Your lambs are still for now, Clarice,
but not forever... You'll have to
earn it again and again, this blessed
silence. Because it's the plight
that drives you, and the plight will
never end."
821,CLARICE,821,Dr. Lecter -
822,DR. LECTER,822,"I have no plans to call on you,
Clarice, the world being more
interesting with you in it. Be sure
you extend me the same courtesy."
823,CLARICE (V.O.),823,You know I can't make that promise.
824,DR. LECTER,824,"Goodbye, Clarice..."
825,DR. LECTER,825,"You looked - so very lovely today,
in your blue suit."
826,CLARICE,826,Dr. Lecter... Dr. Lecter...!
827,DR. LECTER,827,"Well, Dr. Chilton. Shall we begin?"
