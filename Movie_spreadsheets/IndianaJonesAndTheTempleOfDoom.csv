1,INDIANA,1,Lao She.
2,LAO,2,Nee chin lie how ma?
3,INDIANA,3,"Wah hung how, nee nah?  Wah hwey
hung jing chee jah loo nee kao
soo wah shu shu."
4,LAO,4,"You never told me you spoke my
language, Dr. Jones."
5,INDIANA,5,I don't like to show off.
6,LAO,6,"For this special occasion, I
ordered champagne and caviar."
7,LAO,7,"So, it is true, Dr. Jones?  you
found Nurhachi?"
8,INDIANA,8,"Sure, I found him.  Then last
night I had a little trouble.
Somebody tried to slit my throat."
9,INDIANA (Cont'd),9,"It was dark, but I think one of
your sons tried to get Nurhachi
without paying for him."
10,LAO,10,You have insulted my son.
11,INDIANA,11,"Next time I'll cut off more than
his finger."
12,LAO,12,Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
13,INDIANA,13,"As I recall the deal was consid-
erably more."
14,"WILLIE
(to Lao)",14,"Aren't you going to introduce
us?"
15,LAO,15,This is Willie Scott.
16,LAO,16,"And this is Indiana Jones, the
famous archaeologist."
17,LAO (Cont'd),17,"Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me
and is about to deliver him --
now."
18,WILLIE,18,"Well -- I thought archaeologists
were always funny little men
searching for their mummies --"
19,WILLIE,19,Aaahhh!
20,WILLE (Cont'd),20,"I was only kidding, can't you
take a joke -- ?"
21,WILLE (Cont'd),21,"Lao, he's got a knife!"
22,INDIANA,22,"Put the gun away, sonny."
23,INDIANA,23,"Now I suggest you pay me what you
promised -- or your girlfriend
here is going to be squealing a
new tune."
24,INDIANA,24,"Try again Lao -- the deal was
more."
25,INDIANA (Cont'd),25,"Bingo...you see, Lao, with a
but of persuasion, even you can
be an honest fellow."
26,WILLIE,26,"Look at this!  He put a hole
in my dress from Paris!"
27,LAO,27,Sit down!
28,LAO (Cont'd),28,"To your health, Dr. Jones."
29,INDIANA,29,What's that?
30,LAO,30,"A bonus, Dr. Jones.  That is
poison.  You just drank the
rest of it."
31,LAO (Cont'd),31,"There is an antidote for this
poison.  You give me Nurhachi --
I give you the antidote."
32,LAO (Cont'd),32,"The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.
Where is Nurhachi?"
33,WILLIE,33,This Nurhachi's a very small guy.
34,INDIANA,34,"Inside are the remains of Nur-
hachi -- the first Emperor of the
Manchu Dynasty."
35,INDIANA (Cont'd),35,"Now what about the antidote,
Lao."
36,LAO,36,"At last I have the ashes of my
sacred ancestor!"
37,WILLIE,37,"So, what's the big deal?  Let
me see it --"
38,LAO,38,You fool!
39,WILLIE,39,"Ow, you're hurting me, you miser-
able little hood!"
40,INDIANA,40,"Let go of her, Lao.  And give me
the antidote."
41,INDIANA (Cont'd),41,I like the service here.
42,WILLIE,42,"Hey, he's not a waiter..."
43,INDIANA,43,"No, Wu Han's an old friend I
brought along."
44,(to Lao),44,"So, the game's not over. Put
the antidote on the table, Lao."
45,INDIANA,45,"Wu Han  --  listen to me  --  I'm
going to get you out of here."
46,WU HAN,46,"Not this time, my friend..."
47,WU HAN,47,"I followed you on many adventures --
but into the great Unknown Mystery,
I go first, Indy..."
48,LAO,48,"Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you
will soon join him."
49,INDIANA,49,The antidote -- !
50,INDIANA,50,"Look out, damn it, I need that
antidote!"
51,WILLIE,51,Who cares?  Where's that diamond!
52,WILLIE,52,"Excuse me, but I believe that's
my diamond!"
53,WILLIE,53,Aw nuts!
54,INDIANA (O.S.),54,"Hey,doll!  Don't move!"
55,INDIANA (Cont'd),55,"Hey, don't go away!  I need that!"
56,INDIANA (Cont'd),56,"If I wasn't dying, I'd kill her..."
57,SHORT ROUND,57,Wow!  Holy smoke!  Crash landing!
58,INDIANA,58,"Step on it, Short Round!"
59,SHORT ROUND,59,"Okey doke, Indy!  Hold onto your
potatoes!"
60,WILLIE,60,"For crying out loud, a kid's driv-
ing the car?!"
61,INDIANA,61,"Relax, I've been giving him lessons."
62,WILLIE,62,"Listen, we just met for crissake!
I'm not that kind of gril!"
63,INDIANA,63,"Don't get your hopes up -- where's
the antidote?"
64,WILLIE,64,You don't look very good.
65,INDIANA,65,Poison never agrees with me.
66,INDIANA,66,"Pull a right, Short Round, and
head for the Wang Poo bridge!"
67,SHORT ROUND,67,Check!  Gotcha!
68,WILLIE,68,"Look at what you've done to me!
I'm a mess!  My lipstick's smeared,
I broke two nails, I've got an aw-
ful run in my stocking -- !"
69,INDIANA,69,"Somehow I think you've got bigger
problems."
70,INDIANA (Cont'd),70,"There, Shorty!  Through the
tunnel!"
71,WILLIE,71,"What're we going to do?!  Where're
we going?!"
72,INDIANA,72,"The airport...No, look out,
Short Round!  Left, left!"
73,INDIANA,73,"You got the tickets, Short Round?"
74,SHORT ROUND,74,"Sure, Indy -- three tickets!
You, me and Wu Han --"
75,"INDIANA
(sadly)",75,"Wu Han's not coming, Shorty."
76,SHORT ROUND,76,"Don't worry, Indy.  Short Round
number one bodyguard now!"
77,WILLIE,77,I'll take the extra ticket.
78,WILLIE,78,Where's this plane going anyway?
79,INDIANA,79,Siam.
80,WILLIE,80,"Siam?  But I'm not dressed for
Siam..."
81,WEBER,81,"No, no, they're all right!
Let them through please."
82,INDIANA,82,"Thanks, Weber."
83,WEBER,83,"Dr. Jones, this is positively the
last time our airline can hold a
plane for you.  Now you must hurry!"
84,WILLIE,84,"So, what're you supposed to be,
a lion tamer?"
85,INDIANA,85,"Since I was nice enough to let
you tag along, why don't you give
your mouth a rest?  Okay, doll?"
86,WILLIE,86,"I'm freezing.  What do you mean,
tag along?  From the minute you
walked into that nightclub, you
haven't been able to keep your
eyes off me."
87,INDIANA,87,Oh yeah?
88,CO-PILOT (*subtitled*),88,Good lord!
89,PILOT (*subtitled),89,Dive for the clouds!  Dive!
90,CO-PILOT (*subtitled),90,They hit a fuel line!
91,PILOT (*subtitled*),91,"Reduce speed -- get everyone out
of the plane!"
92,SHORT ROUND,92,Lao send planes to kill Indy!
93,WILLIE,93,"Wake up!  It's the drug he drank
to stop the poison --"
94,CO-PILOT,94,"Please to remain calm.  We start
passing out parachutes now --"
95,WILLIE,95,"You got to be kidding!  No!  No,
I can't!"
96,WILLIE (Cont'd),96,Wait -- who's flying the plane?!
97,WILLIE (Cont'd),97,Nobody's flying the plane ...
98,KAO KAN,98,Jones!  Indiana Jones!
99,CO-PILOT,99,"Put it on!  What's wrong with
you?  You've got to jump!"
100,SHORT ROUND,100,"No, can't leave Indy!"
101,WILLIE,101,"Give me that parachute, I
changed my mind --"
102,SHORT ROUND,102,"No, this last one!  It's for Indy!"
103,INDIANA,103,We there yet?
104,WILLIE,104,There's nobody flying the plane!
105,WILLIE (Cont'd),105,You know how to fly?
106,INDIANA,106,No.
107,INDIANA,107,Do you?
108,SHORT ROUND,108,"Come here, lady, hold this and
shut up please!"
109,SHORT ROUND,109,I get it!
110,WILLIE,110,You got it!
111,SHORT ROUND,111,Oh oh -- big mistake!
112,INDIANA,112,"Short Round, what in the hell
are you doing?"
113,WILLIE,113,"Are you crazy, a lift raft?!  We're
not sinking, we're crashing!"
114,INDIANA,114,"Get over here, damn it!  Short Round,
come on, grab onto me tight!"
115,WILLIE,115,Wait for me!
116,SHORT ROUND,116,Indy?
117,INDIANA,117,"Okay, Shorty."
118,INDIANA (Cont'd),118,You all right?
119,WILLIE,119,"No... I'm not cut out for the
kind of life you lead."
120,WILLIE,120,"Oh no...I ripped my dress.  Where
are we anyway?"
121,INDIANA,121,India...
122,WILLIE,122,"Holy cow -- India?  How do you
know we're in --"
123,WILLIE,123,What'd he say?
124,INDIANA,124,"He told me they knew I was coming
here."
125,WILLIE,125,What do you mean -- how?
126,INDIANA,126,The old man saw it in a dream.
127,WILLIE,127,Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
128,INDIANA,128,"He said that's whey they were at
river -- they were waiting for
the plane to fall down."
129,WILLIE,129,"I hope this means we're going to
get some dinner."
130,WILLIE,130,"God, I am starving, but I can't
eat this..."
131,INDIANA,131,"That's more food than these people
eat in a week."
132,INDIANA,132,"They're starving, too..."
133,WILLIE,133,"I'm sorry, I -- here, please."
134,CHIEFTAIN,134,"You will rest here before you go
on."
135,INDIANA,135,"We'd appreciate that.  This was an
unexpected detour.  We'll have to go
to Delhi now and find a flight west."
136,"SHORT ROUND
(smiling)",136,Indy is taking me to America.
137,INDIANA,137,"I'm a professor.  I have to re-
turn to the university.  Can you
give us a guide to take us to Delhi?"
138,CHIEFTAIN,138,Sanju will guide you.
139,INDIANA,139,Thank you.
140,SHAMAN,140,"On the way to Delhi, you will
stop at Pankot."
141,INDIANA,141,Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
142,SHAMAN,142,You will go to palace there.
143,INDIANA,143,"Hasn't the Pankot palace been de-
serted since the Mutiny of 1857?"
144,SHAMAN,144,"No. Now there is new Maharajah --
and palace is powerful again."
145,SHAMAN (Cont'd),145,"It is Pankot Palace that kills my
village."
146,INDIANA,146,"I don't understand.  What's hap-
pened here?"
147,SHAMAN,147,"The evil starts in Pankot.  Then
like monsoon, it moves darkness
over all country."
148,INDIANA,148,What evil?
149,SHAMAN,149,"They came from Palace and took
sivalinga from out village."
150,WILLIE,150,Took what?
151,INDIANA,151,"It's a sacred stone in a shine
that's supposed to protect a
village."
152,SHAMAN,152,It is why Krishna brought you here.
153,INDIANA,153,"Nobody brought us here.  Our plane
crashed.  We were shot down by --"
154,SHAMAN,154,"No.  We pray to Krishna to help us
find the stone.  It was Krishna who
made you fall from sky -- so you can
got to Pankot Palace.  To find siva-
linga -- and bring back to us."
155,SHORT ROUND,155,"Indy, they make out plane crash?
To get you here?"
156,INDIANA,156,"It's just superstition, Shorty.
Like a ghost story."
157,CHIEFTAIN,157,Yes.
158,INDIANA,158,Was the stone very smooth?
159,INDIANA,159,"It was probably brought here from
a sacred river."
160,SHAMAN,160,"Long ago -- before my father's
father."
161,INDIANA,161,"And it had three lines painted
across it?"
162,shaman nod),162,"The lines represent the three
levels of the universe.  I've seen
stones like the one you lost."
163,WILLIE,163,"I don't understand how losing one
rock could destroy this village."
164,WILLIE,164,Is it really powerful?
165,INDIANA,165,"But why would the Maharajah take
this sacred stone?"
166,SHAMAN,166,"They say we must pray to their
evil god.  We say we will not."
167,INDIANA,167,"He says that when the sacred stone
was taken the village wells dried
up first and then the river stopped."
168,"INDIANA
(translating)",168,"He says their crops dies and then
the animals died."
169,"INDIANA
(translating)",169,And then they took their children.
170,WILLIE,170,Their children?
171,"INDIANA
(translating)",171,"He says one night there was a fire
in the fields.  The men went to
fight it.  When they came back,
they heard the women crying in the
darkness.  And the children were
gone."
172,SHAMAN,172,"You will find them when you find
sivlalinga."
173,INDIANA,173,"I'm sorry, I don't know how I can
help you here."
174,INDIANA (Cont'd),174,"The English authorities who con-
trol this area are the only ones
who can help you."
175,CHIEFTAIN,175,They do not listen.
176,INDIANA,176,"I have friends in Delhi and I will
make sure they investigate this..."
177,SHAMAN,177,"No, you will got to Pankot..."
178,WILLIE,178,What'd he say now?
179,INDIANA,179,"It was destined that I came here --
and the future cannot be changed..."
180,LITTLE BOY,180,Sankara...
181,INDIANA,181,Sankara...
182,INDIANA,182,"Damn it , Willie, get on -- we've
got to move out!"
183,WILLIE,183,Whoa!  Easy now -- nice elephant...
184,SHORT ROUND,184,"I ride with you, Indy?"
185,INDIANA,185,"Nope, you got a little surprise
over there, Shorty."
186,SHORT ROUND,186,Oh boy!
187,WILLIE,187,"This is the first time anybody
ever cried when I left."
188,SHORT ROUND,188,"They don't cry about you.  They
cry about the elephants leaving."
189,WILLIE,189,Figures...
190,SHORT ROUND,190,"They got no food to feed them.  So
they taking the elephants away to
sell them."
191,INDIANA,191,"All right, let's go.  I want to get
to Pankot before tomorrow night."
192,WILLIE,192,"Pankot?!  I thought we were going
to Delhi!  Hey, wait a minute!"
193,WILLIE,193,"Can't somebody take me to Delhi?!
I don't want to go to Pankot!"
194,WILLIE (Cont'd),194,"Indiana!  Damn it!  Why'd you
change your mind?  What did that
kid tell you last night?!"
195,WILLIE,195,"I think you need this more than
me."
196,WILLIE (Cont'd),196,"What're you complaining about,
this is expensive stuff!"
197,SHORT ROUND,197,"Here you go, lunch time!"
198,SHORT ROUND (Cont'd),198,"Indy, look!"
199,WILLIE,199,Those are very big bird.
200,INDIANA,200,"Those aren't birds -- those are
giant bats."
201,WILLIE,201,"They must be pretty dumb to drink
that awful-looking water."
202,INDIANA,202,I think maybe we'll camp here.
203,INDIANA,203,"Hey, Willie -- I think you better
get out now."
204,WILLIE,204,"Stark naked?  You wish... If you're
trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones,
this is a very primitive approach."
205,INDIANA,205,"Me seduce you?  Honey, you're the
one who took your clothes off."
206,INDIANA,206,"I just came over to remind you
that you never know what else
might be in the water."
207,WILLIE,207,Somehow I feel safer in here.
208,WILLIE,208,Indy!  Help me!
209,INDIANA,209,"Don't worry, I'm coming in!  What
is it?"
210,WILLIE,210,A snake!
211,INDIANA,211,A what...?
212,WILLIE,212,A SNAKE!!
213,WILLIE (Cont'd),213,"Hurry, help me out of here!
What're you waiting for?!"
214,INDIANA,214,"Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a
better idea."
215,WILLIE,215,What?!
216,INDIANA,216,First of all -- don't panic!
217,WILLIE,217,"It's got me !  Indy, help me!"
218,INDIANA,218,Don't let it pull you deeper!
219,WILLIE,219,It's pulling me deeper!
220,INDIANA,220,Don't let it curl around you!
221,WILLIE,221,"It's curling around me!  Damn it,
stop talking and do something!"
222,WILLIE (Cont'd),222,"What's wrong?!  Indy please help
me!"
223,INDIANA,223,"Listen, Willie.  Do exactly what
I tell you now."
224,WILLIE,224,What?!
225,INDIANA,225,Can you move your arm?
226,WILLIE,226,Just one arm!
227,INDIANA,227,"Okay, I want you to lift your hand --
and pet the snake."
228,WILLIE,228,PET IT??!!
229,INDIANA,229,"Yes, stroke it right along the
maxillary and precaudal verte-
brae."
230,WILLIE,230,THE WHAT?!
231,INDIANA,231,"Pet it on the head!  Go on, pet
it!"
232,WILLIE,232,"Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to
crush me!"
233,INDIANA,233,Keep stroking it!
234,INDIANA (Cont'd),234,What's happening?
235,WILLIE,235,It's starting to let go!
236,INDIANA,236,That's good  -- you're doing fine.
237,WILLIE,237,"It's letting fo.  I think it's --
I think it's going to sleep!"
238,INDIANA,238,See -- I got you out...
239,WILLIE,239,Thanks for nothing!  I hate snakes!
240,the water),240,I know the feeling...
241,SHORT ROUND,241,"You come to America with me, and
we can get job in the circus --
you like that?"
242,WILLIE,242,"Where'd you find your little body-
guard?"
243,INDIANA,243,"I met Short Round when he tried
to pick my pocket."
244,INDIANA (Cont'd),244,"Shorty's family was killed when
they bombed Shanghai.  He was
living on the streets."
245,WILLIE,245,He'll be okay.  He's a good kid.
246,WILLIE (Cont'd),246,"All these fires -- you expecting
more snakes, Dr. Jones?"
247,INDIANA,247,"By the way, how'd you end up in
Shanghai?"
248,WILLIE,248,"Well, when my nightclub career was
run over by the Depression, some
pinhead convinced me that ""a girl
could go places in the Orient...""
So, look where I got."
249,INDIANA,249,What about the future?
250,WILLIE,250,"Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to
latch onto a good-looking, in-
credibly rich prince."
251,INDIANA,251,"I'd like to find one of those
myself."
252,WILLIE,252,Oh really?
253,INDIANA,253,"Yeah, but he's got to be dead and
buried for a couple of thousand years."
254,INDIANA,254,Fortune and glory...
255,WILLIE,255,"Is that what you're hoping to find
at this palace, Dr. Jones?"
256,INDIANA,256,Maybe...
257,WILLIE,257,What's that?
258,INDIANA,258,"Something that kid gave me last
night.  It's a piece of an old
manuscript."
259,INDIANA (Cont'd),259,"The drawing shows a priest named
Sankara who lived centuries ago."
260,WILLIE,260,What does the writing say?
261,INDIANA,261,"It's Sanskrit.  It tells the story
of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa
where he met the Hindu god Shiva."
262,WILLIE,262,"That's Shiva?  What's he giving
the Priest?"
263,INDIANA,263,"Legend says he told Sankara to go
forth and combat evil.  To do that
he gave him five sacred stones that
had magical powers."
264,WILLIE,264,"You mean magical like the rock that
was stolen from that village?"
265,INDIANA,265,It could be.
266,"WILLIE
(quietly)",266,"Fortune and glory...sweet dreams,
Dr. Jones."
267,INDIANA,267,I think you should sleep closer.
268,INDIANA,268,I meant for safety.
269,WILLIE,269,"I'd be safer sleeping with
that snake."
270,WILLIE,270,"Did you see it?!  It was one
of those bats!"
271,(staring into,271,"God, what else is out there...?!"
272,INDIANA,272,"Couldn't keep away, huh?"
273,WILLIE,273,Just try and control yourself.
274,INDIANA,274,"Still scared?  Okay, Willie, you
can get closer if you want..."
275,INDIANA,275,"Honey, I knew you'd be the first
one to give in..."
276,INDIANA (Cont'd),276,"You're going to start something
I'm going to have to finish."
277,INDIANA (Cont'd),277,"Okay, doll, you asked for it."
278,SHORT ROUND,278,"Indy, look!"
279,INDIANA,279,That's it.  Pankot Palace.
280,WILLIE (O.S.),280,Why are we stopping here?
281,SHORT ROUND,281,"What you look at, Indy?"
282,INDIANA,282,Just a statue.
283,WILLIE,283,"What's the guide talking about?
He hasn't said a word the whole
trip."
284,WILLIE,284,He's afraid of something.
285,INDIANA,285,"He said he couldn't take us any
farther.  He has to go sell the
elephants."
286,WILLIE,286,"You mean we have to walk the rest
of the way?"
287,WILLIE,287,"-- shot at, fallen out of a plane,
nearly drowned, squashed by a snake,
attacked by a bat -- I smell like
an elephant!"
288,WILLIE,288,I tell you I'm not going to make it!
289,INDIANA,289,Any more complaints?
290,WILLIE,290,"Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this
sooner..."
291,INDIANA,291,"It doesn't feel like there's been
any permanent damage."
292,INDIANA,292,Hello?...(hello?)...(hello?)
293,WILLIE,293,Hi...(hi)...(hi)...
294,CHATTAR LAL,294,I would say you look rather lost.
295,CHATTAR LAL,295,"But then I cannot imagine where
in the world the three of you
would look at home..."
296,INDIANA,296,"Lost?  No, we're not lost.  We're
on our way to Delhi.  This is Miss
Scott -- and Mr. Round.  My name's
Indiana Jones."
297,CHATTAR LAL,297,"Dr. Jones?  The eminent archae-
ologist?"
298,WILLIE,298,"Hard to believe, isn't it...?"
299,CHATTAR LAL,299,"I remember first hearing your name
when I was studying at Oxford.  I
Am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for
His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot."
300,CHATTAR LAL (Cont'd),300,Welcome to Pankot Palace.
301,WILLIE,301,"How'd you like to run into him in
a dark alley...that one's kind of
cute...I could see myself married
to a prince like that..."
302,CHATTAR LAL,302,"The plane crash and your journey
here sound -- most incredible."
303,WILLIE,303,You should have been there...
304,INDIANA,304,"We'd appreciate it if the Mahara-
jah would let us stay tonight.
We'll be on out way in the morn-
ing."
305,CHATTAR LAL,305,"I am only his humble servant, but
the Maharajah usually listens to
my advice."
306,WILLIE,306,Is that him?
307,WILLIE (Cont'd),307,"He's not exactly what we call
""a spring chicken""."
308,CHATTAR LAL,308,"No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the
present Maharajah's late father."
309,WILLIE,309,"Oh -- good.  And maybe the pres-
ent Marahajah is a little younger?
And thinner?"
310,CHATTAR LAL,310,"They will escort you to your rooms
now.  You will be provided with
fresh clothes.  Tonight you will
be dining with His Highness."
311,WILLIE,311,"Dinner?  And with a prince?!  My
luck is changing.  But look at
me -- my god, I've to to get
ready!"
312,CHATTAR LAL,312,"Eight o'clock in the Pleasure
Pavilion."
313,INDIANA,313,You look like a princess.
314,WILLIE,314,It's sort of like being in heaven.
315,INDIANA,315,"I've always had a weakness for
folk dancing."
316,WILLIE,316,"She might get away with that act
here, but she'd never make it in
a real nightclub."
317,CHATTAR LAL,317,"We are fortunate tonight to have
some many unexpected guests.  his
is Captain Phillip Blumburtt."
318,CHATTAR LAL (Cont'd),318,"Captain Blumburtt and his troops
are here to check up on the
""natives""."
319,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,319,Just a routine inspection tour.
320,CHATTAR LAL,320,"The British worry so about their
Emprie -- it makes us feel like
well-cared-for children."
321,WILLIE,321,"Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call
the Maharajah's  wife?"
322,CHATTAR LAL,322,"His Highness has not yet taken a
wife."
323,WILLIE,323,"No?  Well, I guess he just hasn't
met the right woman..."
324,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,324,Interested in local curios?
325,INDIANA,325,"No.  But I am interested in the
occult.  And this is a krtya."
326,"CAPT. BLUMBURTT
(grimacing)",326,Charming.
327,INDIANA,327,"It's like the voodoo dolls of West
Africa.  The kryta represents your
enemy -- and gives you complete
power over him."
328,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,328,"That God all that mumbo jumbo
rubbish is disappearing."
329,INDIANA,329,You think so?
330,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,330,"Of course.  Admittedly, it's taken
time.  Britian's controlled India
for almost two hundred eyars now."
331,INDIANA,331,"You're hanging on better here
than you did in America."
332,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,332,"This is a different situation, Dr.
Jones.  These people are like
children.  We have to lead them
slowly into the twentieth century."
333,INDIANA,333,"The Prime Minister doesn't seem
that naive."
334,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,334,"No, he's a very shrewd old boy.
Power behind the throne and all
that.  He actually runs this whole
province."
335,WILLIE,335,"I think this Maharajah is swim-
ming in money.  Maybe coming here
wasn't such a bad idea."
336,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,336,"I believe we're being called to
dinner."
337,WILLIE,337,Finally!
338,CHATTAR LAL,338,"His Supremem Highness, guardian of
Rajput tradition -- the Maharajah
of Pankot -- Zalim Singh."
339,WILLIE,339,That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
340,INDIANA,340,Maybe he likes older women.
341,INDIANA,341,"Cheer up, you lost your prince,
but dinner's on the way."
342,WILLIE,342,"I've never been so hungry in my
life..."
343,WILLIE,343,"My god, sort of grusome, isn't
it...?"
344,CHATTAR LAL,344,"His Highness wants me to welcome
his visitors.  Especially the
renowned Dr. Jones from America."
345,INDIANA,345,We are honored to be here.
346,WILLIE,346,Suddenly I'm not so hungry...
347,INDIANA,347,"I had a question, Mr. Prime Mini-
ster.  I was examining some of the
Maharajah's artifacts."
348,CHATTAR LAL,348,"A very fine collection of very old
pieces, don't you think?"
349,INDIANA,349,"Yes, very fine.  But not all of the
pieces look old.  Some were carved
recently and look like images used
by the Thuggees to worship the god-
des Kali."
350,CHATTAR LAL,350,"Dr. Jones, you know very well that
the Thuggee cult has been dead for
nearly a century."
351,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,351,"Of course.  The Thuggees were an
obscenity that worshipped Kali
with human sacrifices.  The Brit-
ish Army wiped them out about the
time of the Mutiny of 1857."
352,MERCHANT,352,But you're not eating!
353,WILLIE,353,I uh -- had bugs for lunch.
354,INDIANA,354,"I suppose stories of the Thuggees
die hard."
355,CHATTAR LAL,355,There are no stories anymore.
356,INDIANA,356,"Well, I don't know... we came here
from a small village and the peas-
ants there told us that the Pankot
Palace was growing powerful again
-- becuase of some ancient evil."
357,CHATTAR LAL,357,"Their stories are just fear and
folklore."
358,"INDIANA
(cooly)",358,"Maybe.. but how do you explain
The Thuggee shrine I saw right
below the palace?"
359,CHATTAR LAL,359,"The local peasants are just as
superstitious.  You're very ob-
servant, Dr. Jones.  But you're
beginning to worry Capt. Blum-
burtt."
360,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,360,"I'm not worried, Prime Minister,
just interested."
361,WILLIE,361,Give me your hat...
362,SHORT ROUND,362,What for?
363,WILLIE,363,I'm going to puke in it...
364,INDIANA,364,"You know the villagers also
claimed that this palace stole
something from them."
365,CHATTAR LAL,365,"Dr. Jones, it our country a guest
does not usually insult his host."
366,INDIANA,366,"Sorry, I thought we were just talking
about folklore."
367,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,367,"I'm sure it's nothing.  Just ru-
mors."
368,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,368,"What was it they claimed was
stolen?"
369,INDIANA,369,Something magical.  A sacred rock.
370,CHATTAR LAL,370,"There, you see, Captain.  A rock!"
371,INDIANA,371,"When they lost this rock their
fields and animals dies.  They
also said their children were
taken from them."
372,CHATTAR LAL,372,"I think that's enough  of this
nonsense, Dr. Jones..."
373,WILLIE,373,"So you have something, you know,
simple -- like soup or something?"
374,MERCHANT,374,Looks delicious!
375,WILLIE,375,I wanna go home...
376,INDIANA,376,"I was dubious muself at first.
Then something connected -- the
village's rock and the old legend
of the Sankara Stones..."
377,CHATTAR LAL,377,"Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors.  I seem to re-
member that in Honduras you were
accused of being a grave robber
rather than a scientist."
378,INDIANA,378,"The newspapers exaggerated the
incident"
379,CHATTAR LAL,379,"And didn't the Sultan of Madagas-
car threaten to cut your head off
if you ever returned to his coun-
try?"
380,INDIANA,380,That was a misunderstanding.
381,"CHATTAR LAL
(smiling)",381,"Exactly what we have here, Dr.
Jones."
382,MAHARAJAH,382,"I have heard the terrible stories
of the evil Thuggee cult..."
383,MAHARAJAH (Cont'd),383,"I thought the stories were told
to frighten children.  Later, I
learned that the Thuggee cult was
once real and did unspeakable
things."
384,MAHARAJAH (Cont'd),384,"I am ashamed of what happened here
so many years ago.  We keep these
objects -- to remind us that this
will never again happen in my
kingdom!"
385,INDIANA,385,I'm sorry if I've offended you.
386,MERCHANT,386,"Ah, dessert!"
387,MERCHANT (Cont'd),387,Chilled monkey brains!
388,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,388,"Rather bizarre menu, woundn't you
say?"
389,INDIANA,389,"Even if they were trying to scare
us away, a devout Hindu would
never touch meat."
390,INDIANA,390,"Makes you wonder what these people
are..."
391,MAHARAJAH,391,"I have seen this thing.  What is
it, Dr. Jones?"
392,SHORT ROUND,392,"Hey, nobody touches Indy's whip!"
393,INDIANA,393,"We're guests here, Shorty."
394,MAHARAJAH,394,"You will show me how it works
please."
395,INDIANA,395,"You wish is my command, your
Highness."
396,MAHARAJAH,396,"That is wonderful!  Please teach
me how!"
397,INDIANA,397,"Okay, Short Round, let go of it."
398,INDIANA (Cont'd),398,"The Turks say that a whip can be
an enemy even to its owner.  If
you get some rope, it'll be easier
to learn with, your Highness.
Now, I think we'll say goodnight."
399,SHORT ROUND,399,"That little Maharajah think he
big stuff."
400,INDIANA,400,You don't like him do you?
401,SHORT ROUND,401,"Next time I flatten him!  Did you
see his eyes?"
402,INDIANA,402,No.
403,SHORT ROUND,403,"Indy, they glow like fire and get
real crazy!  Then he talk in this
real scary voice!"
404,INDIANA,404,"He was afraid of you.  He knows a
tough  guy when he sees one."
405,SHORT ROUND,405,"Yeah, that's what happened..."
406,INDIANA,406,I better see how Willie is.
407,INDIANA,407,I brought you something.
408,WILLIE,408,Not leftovers?
409,INDIANA,409,No -- real food.
410,WILLIE,410,"Oh, it is real food...it's
beautiful."
411,WILLIE (Cont'd),411,"You're nice.  Listen, I'm taking
applications -- how'd you like to
be my palace slave?"
412,INDIANA,412,"Wearing your jewels to be, prin-
cess?"
413,WILLIE,413,Yeah -- and nothing else.
414,WILLIE,414,That shock you?
415,INDIANA,415,"I'm a scientist.  I like doing
research on certain ""nocturnal
activities"" --"
416,WILLIE,416,You mean like love rituals...
417,INDIANA,417,And mating customs...
418,WILLIE,418,Primitive sexual practices?
419,INDIANA,419,"You're taling to an authority
in that area."
420,WILLIE,420,"You're dying to come into my room,
aren't you?"
421,INDIANA,421,"You want me so bad, why don't you
invite me?"
422,WILLIE,422,"Too proud to admit you're crazy
about me, Dr. Jones?"
423,INDIANA,423,"I think you're too used to get-
ting you own way, Willie..."
424,WILLIE,424,"We'll see who gives in first --
I'll leave my door open."
425,INDIANA,425,Don't catch cold.
426,WILLIE,426,Dr. Jones -- ?
427,WILLIE (Cont'd),427,"Five minutes... you'll be back
over here in five minutes..."
428,INDIANA,428,"You're dreaming, Willie.  You want
to make it real, just knock on my
door."
429,INDIANA,429,Five minutes... fat chance.
430,WILLIE,430,"Five minutes, Dr. Jones..."
431,INDIANA,431,...want me to be her palace slave!
432,SHORT ROUND,432,"Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up
and keep eye on things..."
433,INDIANA,433,"Okay, Shorty ... see you in the
morning...I'm going to have a
little -- word with Willie."
434,WILLIE,434,"He's not coming...I can't be-
lieve it..."
435,WILLIE (Cont'd),435,Well...
436,WILLIE (Cont'd),436,No!  I'm not going over there...
437,WILLIE (Cont'd),437,"Sleep tight, Dr. Jones!"
438,WILLIE (Cont'd),438,"I could've been your greatest ad-
venture..."
439,SHORT ROUND,439,"Don't worry, Indy!  Where are
they?!"
440,INDIANA,440,"It's okay, it's over -- go turn
off the fan."
441,INDIANA,441,"This a cheap trick to get me over
here?"
442,WILLIE,442,No -- don't you see -- crawling --
443,INDIANA,443,What -- the bug?
444,WILLIE,444,Get -- the -- bug -- off!
445,INDIANA,445,"Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an
ugly critter like that!"
446,"SHORT ROUND
(grinning)",446,Uh uh -- me neither!
447,WILLIE,447,Oh no -- oh no!!
448,INDIANA,448,"You know, Willie, I'll bet he's
mad because they were eating his
friends for dinner."
449,WILLIE,449,"Please -- oh please, I'm going to
die!  Get it off!"
450,WILLIE,450,"What did I do to deserve this
trip?!"
451,SHORT ROUND,451,"It went under.  Hey, I feel
wind, Indy."
452,WILLIE,452,"I'm packing!  I'm getting out of
here right now tonight!"
453,INDIANA,453,"*(He reads aloud an inscription
in Sanskrit)."
454,SHORT ROUND,454,"What does it mean, Indy?"
455,INDIANA,455,"""Follow in the footsteps of
Shiva.  Do not betray his truth."""
456,INDIANA,456,"*(He repeats aloud the inscrip-
tion also written on the cloth)"
457,WILLIE,457,"I don't care if I have to walk to
Delhi, I'm -- hey!"
458,WILLIE (Cont'd),458,"Wait a minute!  What're you --
where're you going?!"
459,INDIANA,459,"Lock your door and don't leave
until we get back."
460,SHORT ROUND,460,"I don't think we suppose to be in
here, Indy..."
461,SHORT ROUND (Cont'd),461,I step on something.
462,INDIANA,462,"You're right, there's something
all over the floor..."
463,INDIANA (Cont'd),463,We'll have to crawl.
464,SHORT ROUND,464,"Indy, the floor -- there is some-
thing alive!"
465,SHORT ROUND,465,"Holy smoke -- I'm scared, Indy!"
466,INDIANA,466,There's a chamber here.  Come on --
467,INDIANA,467,Damn!
468,WILLIE (O.S.),468,Hey -- where are you?!
469,WILLIE (Cont'd),469,Indiana Jones?!  Are you in there?!
470,INDIANA,470,"Yes, we're in here..."
471,SHORT ROUND,471,"Indy, I found a --"
472,SHORT ROUND (Cont'd),472,Indy -- !
473,INDIANA,473,Uh -- Willie?!
474,(louder),474,"Willie, you better get down here!"
475,WILLIE,475,What?!
476,INDIANA (O.S.),476,"Willie, come here!  Hurry up,
we're in trouble!!"
477,SHORT ROUND (O.S.),477,"Willie, help!!"
478,INDIANA,478,"Willie, damn it!  Get down here,
NOW"
479,WILLIE,479,"Oh hell -- I bet I get all dirty
again!"
480,INDIANA (O.S.),480,WILLIE?!
481,WILLIE,481,"I'm coming, what's the rush?!
Ohh!  What's that?!  There's
stuff all over the floor!  I
can't see a thing!"
482,INDIANA,482,"Move, Willie!  Faster!"
483,WILLIE,483,"It's all wet and icky!  Aaahh --
things are moving!!"
484,SHORT ROUND (O.S.),484,"Please, Willie!"
485,WILLIE,485,"There's bugs!  Bugs all over!
Help!  Help me!"
486,INDIANA (O.S.),486,"Willie, open the door!  GET US
OUT OF HERE!"
487,WILLIE,487,OPEN THE DOOR!  LET ME IN!!
488,INDIANA,488,"GET US OUT!  Willie, shut up and
listen!  There's got to be a ful-
crum release!  Look around!"
489,WILLIE (O.S.),489,A what?!
490,INDIANA (O.S.),490,A fulcrum release lever!
491,WILLIE,491,"I can't find any lever!  Help me
Indy!"
492,INDIANA,492,"Look around, Willie!  There's got to
be a liever hidden somewhere!  Come
on, you can do it!"
493,WILLIE,493,"There's a hole!  I found a square
hole!"
494,INDIANA (O.S.),494,"That's it -- the release lever --
look inside!"
495,WILLIE,495,I am -- it looks horrible!
496,INDIANA (O.S.),496,Reach inside!
497,WILLIE,497,"I can't, Indy!  I can't!"
498,INDIANA,498,"The lever!  Willie, do it!  NOW!"
499,WILLIE,499,"Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!"
500,INDIANA (O.S.),500,Willie!
501,SHORT ROUND,501,"Willie, help us!  Hurry!"
502,WILLIE,502,Get is off me -- get it off!
503,WILLIE (Cont'd),503,"You left me out there!  What in
the hell were you doing in here?!
I want to leave this place right
now!!"
504,INDIANA,504,"Not that one!  We had enought of
that one, thank you..."
505,WILLIE,505,What is it...?
506,INDIANA,506,"It's a Thuggee ceremony.  They're
whorshipping Kali, the goddess of
Death and Destruction."
507,WILLIE,507,"Oh my God!  He ripped out his --
he killed him!"
508,INDIANA,508,No...the heart's still beating!
509,THE MULTITUDE,509,"Jai ma Kali, jai ma Kali!"
510,THE MULTITUDE,510,"Jai ma Kali,  jai ma Kali!"
511,WILLIE,511,Let's go!  Let's get out of here!
512,INDIANA,512,Quiet!
513,INDIANA,513,"The village knew their rock was
magic -- but they didn't know it
was one of the lost Sankara Stones..."
514,SHORT ROUND,514,Why they glow like that?
515,INDIANA,515,"Legend says that when the stones
are brought together the diamonds
inside of them will glow."
516,WILLIE,516,Diamonds...?
517,INDIANA,517,"Okay -- now listen -- you wait here
and keep quiet.  Shorty, keep an
eye on her."
518,WILLIE,518,Wait -- what're you doing?
519,INDIANA,519,I'm going down.
520,WILLIE,520,"Down?  Down there?!  Are you
crazy --!"
521,INDIANA,521,"I'm not leaving without those
stones."
522,WILLIE,522,"You're gonna get killed chasing
after your damn fortune and
glory!"
523,INDIANA,523,Maybe...someday.
524,INDIANA,524,Not today.
525,SHORT ROUND,525,"I keep my eye peeled, Indy."
526,WILLIE,526,"Oh hell, where's he going?"
527,WILLIE,527,What're you -- ?
528,WILLIE (Cont'd),528,"Keep your paws off, letch!"
529,SHORT ROUND,529,Run Willie!
530,SHORT ROUND (Cont'd),530,No!  Run!  Go get help!
531,SHORT ROUND,531,"Indy -- you knocked out when you
fall.  You okay?"
532,SHORT ROUND,532,"This is Nainsukh -- from the vil-
lage.  They bring him here to dig
in the mines."
533,INDIANA,533,Why?
534,NAINSUKH,534,"Children are small -- we can work
in tunnels.  Now I am too old."
535,SHORT ROUND,535,What they do to you now?
536,NAINSUKH,536,"I pray to Shiva -- let me die.
But I do not.  Now -- now the
evil of Kali take me."
537,SHORT ROUND,537,How?
538,NAINSUKH,538,"They will make me drink blood of
Kali.  Then I fall into black
sleep of Kali Ma..."
539,INDIANA,539,What is that?
540,NAINSUKH,540,"I become like them.  I be  alive --
nut like in nightmare.  You drink
the blood, you not wake up from
nightmare of Kali Ma."
541,MOLA RAM,541,"You were caught trying to steal
the Sankara Stones."
542,INDIANA,542,"Nobody's perfect.  The way I
heard it, you stole one of them
from a small village."
543,MOLA RAM,543,"There were five stones in the
beginning.  Over the centuries
they were dispersed by wars,
sold off by thieves like you..."
544,INDIANA,544,Two are still missing.
545,MOLA RAM,545,"No.  They are here -- somewhere.
A century ago when the British
raided this temple and butchered
my people, a loyal priest his the
last two stones down here in the
catacombs."
546,INDIANA,546,"That's what you've got these chil-
dren -- these slaves digging for?"
547,MOLA RAM,547,"They dig for the gems to support
our cause.  They also search for
the last two stones.  Soon we will
have all five Sankara Stones and
the Thuggees will be all powerful!"
548,INDIANA,548,"Nobody can say you don't have a
vivid imagination."
549,MOLA RAM,549,"You do not believe me?  You will,
Dr. Jones.  You will become a true
believer."
550,MOLA RAM (Cont'd),550,"Your Highness will witness the
thief's conversion."
551,MAHARAJAH,551,"You will not suffer.  I recently
became of age and tasted the blood
of Kali."
552,MOLA RAM,552,Hold him!
553,MAHARAJAH,553,"You will learn to obey because
you are powerless!"
554,MAHARAJAH (Cont'd),554,I control you now!
555,MAHARAJAH (Cont'd),555,"You told me that a whip could be
an enemy to its owner.  We shall
see!  Turn him over!"
556,MAHARAJAH (Cont'd),556,"As Dr. Jones suggested, I have
been practicing."
557,MOLA RAM,557,"The British in India will be
slaughtered.  Then we will over-
run the Moslems and force their
""Allah"" to bow to Kali."
558,MOLA RAM (Cont'd),558,"And then the Hebrew God will fall
and finally the Christian God will
be cast down and forgotten."
559,MOLA RAM (Cont'd),559,Soon Kali Ma will rule the world!
560,WILLIE,560,"Oh my God, you scared me!  Listen,
you've got to help.  We found this
tunnel --"
561,"CAPT. BLUMBURTT
(to Chattar Lal)",561,"Jones isn't in his room.  Miss
Scott -- my troops are leaving at
dawn if you want us to escort you
to Delhi --"
562,WILLIE,562,"No -- you can't go!  Something aw-
ful's happened.  They've got Short
Round and I think Indy's been --"
563,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,563,What?
564,WILLIE,564,"We found a tennel that leads to a
temple below the palace!  Please,
come with me, I'll show you!"
565,CHATTAR LAL,565,"Miss Scott, you're not making any
sense."
566,WILLIE,566,"I'm afraid they'll kill them!  We
saw horrible things down there --
they had a human sacrifice and they
ripped a man's heart out!"
567,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,567,Who?
568,WILLIE,568,"It's some kind of cult!  And they've
got the sacred stones that Indy was
searching for."
569,CHATTAR LAL,569,"I sense the fumes of opium in all
this.  Prehaps Miss Scott picked
up the habit in Shanghai."
570,WILLIE,570,"What're you talking about -- I'm
not a dope fiend!  I saw it!  I'll
show you!"
571,INDIANA,571,"What're we playing, hid and seek?"
572,WILLIE,572,"Oh, Indy, you got away!  Tell them
what happened, they won't believe
me --"
573,INDIANA,573,It's okay.  You're all right now.
574,WILLIE,574,"They think I'm insane.  Tell them
I'm not, Indy.  Please -- help me ..."
575,INDIANA,575,"Hey, I thought you were supposed
to be a real tropper.  Willie?"
576,WILLIE,576,What?
577,INDIANA,577,You've got to go to sleep now.
578,WILLIE,578,I want to go home...
579,INDIANA,579,"I don't blame you... this hasn't
been what you'd call a fun vaca-
tion..."
580,INDIANA,580,"I've spent by life crawling around
in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't
have let somebody like Willie go
in there with me."
581,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,581,Miss Scott panicked?
582,INDIANA,582,"When she saw the insects she passed
out cold.  I carried her back to
her room.  She was sleeping when I
re-entered the tunnel to look
around."
583,CHATTAR LAL,583,"As she slept, she undoubtedly had
nightmares."
584,INDIANA,584,"Then she must have run out of the
room and you found her."
585,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,585,"Did you discover anything in that
tunnel, Dr. Jones?"
586,INDIANA,586,"Nothing.  Just a dead end.  That
tunnel's been deserted for years."
587,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,587,"Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my re-
port will duly note that we
found nothing unusual here in
Pankot."
588,CHATTAR LAL,588,"I'm sure that will please the
Maharajah, Captain."
589,"CAPT. BLUMBURTT
(to Indiana)",589,"As I said before, we'd be happy to
escort you to Delhi."
590,INDIANA,590,"Thanks, but I don't think Willie is
ready to travel yet."
591,WILLIE,591,Indy?  Did you walk to them?
592,INDIANA,592,Yes.
593,WILLIE,593,So now they believe me.
594,INDIANA,594,"Yes, they believe you."
595,WILLIE,595,"Then they'll send the soldiers
down into the temple..."
596,WILLIE (Cont'd),596,"I was scared to death last night
when I thought they were going to
kill you."
597,INDIANA,597,No... they won't kill me.
598,WILLIE,598,"You know you've been nothing but
trouble since I hooked up with
you -- but I have to admit I'd
miss you if I lost you..."
599,INDIANA,599,"You won't lose me, Willie..."
600,INDIANA,600,"No!  I've found it -- you can't --
Kali knows!"
601,INDIANA,601,"-- been too many lies -- there's no
god's heaven -- just -- the horror!
I've seen it -- life preying on
life!"
602,INDIANA,602,"-- rivers -- destroying mountains --
a comet in space -- exploding!"
603,INDIANA,603,"Aaahh! -- the screams -- pitiful
people -- their pain -- the hate --
and greed -- always greed!"
604,INDIANA,604,"-- but I've found -- Kali's touch!
Death -- no more lies -- the death
I've been searching for!"
605,INDIANA,605,"Quit crying!  She can hear you --
Kali knows fear -- don't you under-
stand -- Kali is freedom!"
606,CHATTAR LAL,606,"Mola Ram is telling the faithful
of out victory.  He says the
British have left the palace,
which proves Kali Ma's new power."
607,INDIANA,607,"Yes, I understand."
608,SHORT ROUND,608,His eyes -- they go out.
609,FAT GUARD,609,No!  NO!
610,SHORT ROUND,610,The pain -- the pain makes him wake up!
611,SHORT ROUND,611,Indy!  I can make Indy wake up!
612,SHORT ROUND,612,Indy!
613,CHATTAR LAL,613,You understand what he tells us?
614,INDIANA,614,"Kali Ma protects us now and for-
ever, and we must pledge our
devotion by worshipping her with
an offering of flesh and blood!"
615,CHATTAR LAL,615,"Your friend has seen and she has
heard -- now she will not talk."
616,WILLIE,616,Indy!  Help me!  Indy?!
617,"CHATTAR LAL
(to Indy)",617,"This will prove your devotion to
Kali."
618,WILLIE,618,"Please, God, don't let them do
this to me -- help me, Indy!"
619,WILLIE (Cont'd),619,No -- no!
620,SHORT ROUND,620,Indy -- !
621,SHORT ROUND,621,No -- Indy -- wake up!
622,SHORT ROUND,622,"Wake up!  It's just a nightmare,
Indy!  Wake up, please Indy!"
623,SHORT ROUND (Cont'd),623,"Indy, you back?"
624,INDIANA,624,No!  Give him to me!
625,SHORT ROUND,625,"No, Indy, no!"
626,SHORT ROUND (Cont'd),626,We got to help Willie!
627,WILLIE,627,Look out -- !
628,INDIANA,628,"Come on, quick!"
629,WILLIE,629,What're we going to do?
630,INDIANA,630,"We're going to get them out
of here -- !"
631,INDIANA (Cont'd),631,"And then we're going to get these
out of here -- !"
632,INDIANA (Cont'd),632,"And somehow I'm going to see this
place destroyed."
633,INDIANA (O.S.),633,"Ah, sir?  Excuse me --"
634,INDIANA (Cont'd),634,"Listen, I'm from the union and I'd
like to talk about the working
conditions here.  Could you step
inside a minute?"
635,INDIANA,635,"No, wait!"
636,WILLIE,636,What're we going to do?!
637,INDIANA,637,There's got to be another way out.
638,INDIANA,638,"Those empty cars have got to go
out of the mines."
639,INDIANA (Cont'd),639,"Come on, let's see if we can
catch a ride..."
640,INDIANA (Cont'd),640,"Okay, Shorty -- go!"
641,WILLIE,641,I can't!
642,INDIANA,642,Go!
643,INDIANA,643,"We've got to get across to the
empty cars.  Wait here until I
signal you."
644,INDIANA,644,Come on!
645,INDIANA (Cont'd),645,"Come one, what's wrong?"
646,SHORT ROUND,646,Behind you!
647,INDIANA,647,I see the problem...
648,WILLIE,648,What happened?
649,WILLIE,649,What's wrong with him?
650,WILLIE,650,"I got one!  Indy, I got one!"
651,WILLIE,651,"Indy, look out!"
652,SHORT ROUND,652,"How you like bing pin cushion,
Mr. Rajah-ha-ha?"
653,MAHARAJAH,653,Please -- pull it out!
654,SHORT ROUND,654,It was the black sleep of Kali...
655,MAHARAJAH,655,"They made me do evil things...
may lord Krishna forgive me."
656,WILLIE,656,"Get down here, Shorty!  I got us
a ride!"
657,WILLIE (Cont'd),657,"Come on, let's see hoe hand your
head is!"
658,MAHARAJAH,658,"Please -- listen -- to go out
you must take the left tunnel."
659,SHORT ROUND,659,Thanks pal.
660,MAHARAJAH,660,"I'm going to try to find the
English soldiers."
661,SHORT ROUND,661,Good luck.
662,WILLIE,662,"I don't appreciate being cooked
like a french fry!"
663,SHORT ROUND,663,"Willie, come on!"
664,SHORT ROUND (Cont'd),664,You do pretty good for a girl!
665,SHORT ROUND,665,Indy!  Hurry!
666,MOLA RAM,666,"They've stolen the Sankara
Stones -- they must be stopped!"
667,SHORT ROUND,667,"No, Indy, it's left tunnel."
668,INDIANA,668,Come here and take the brake!
669,INDIANA (Cont'd),669,"Slow on the curves or we'll fly
off the tracks!"
670,SHORT ROUND,670,"Read you loud and clear, Indy!"
671,INDIANA,671,Let up on the brake!
672,SHORT ROUND,672,What?!
673,INDIANA,673,"Let her go!  Our only chance is
outrunning them!"
674,WILLIE,674,What above the curves?!
675,SHORT ROUND,675,"Indy, look out!"
676,WILLIE,676,"What're you doing?!  We're going
too fast!!"
677,INDIANA,677,Get over on the other side!
678,INDIANA,678,"One down, one to go!"
679,WILLIE,679,Anymore ideas...?
680,INDIANA,680,"Yeah -- this time you're gonna
help!"
681,INDIANA,681,Okay  -- one -- two -- NOW!
682,INDIANA,682,"Okay, Shorty, hit the brakes!"
683,SHORT ROUND,683,Indy!!
684,INDIANA,684,"Grab onto me -- I'm going to try
and slow us down from underneath!"
685,WILLIE,685,Oh no!
686,INDIANA,686,What's wrong?
687,INDIANA,687,Ouch...
688,WILLIE,688,"I'm okay -- I'm fine -- I love to
flirt with death..."
689,WILLIE,689,What's that?...Indy?!
690,WILLIE,690,Oh... shit...
691,INDIANA,691,There!  Dive!
692,INDIANA,692,"Lucky I found a short cut.  Look,
there's a light at the end of the
tunnel..."
693,WILLIE,693,Some short cut!
694,INDIANA,694,"Willie -- the bridge!  Climb up
to the bridge!"
695,SHORT ROUND,695,Nothing to it -- follow me!
696,SHORT ROUND,696,Easy like pie!  Kid's stuff!
697,WILLIE,697,Indy -- looks out behind you!
698,INDIANA,698,Let my friends go!
699,INDIANA (Cont'd),699,That's far enough!
700,MOLA RAM,700,"You are in no position to give
orders, Dr. Jones."
701,INDIANA,701,"You want the stones, let them go
and call off your guards!"
702,MOLA RAM,702,"Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I
don't believe you would kill
yourself!"
703,MOLA RAM (Cont'd),703,Your friends will die with you!
704,INDIANA,704,"Then I guess we're all going to
take a big dive!"
705,MOLA RAM,705,Give me the stones!
706,INDIANA,706,"Mola Ram -- you're about to meet
Kali -- in Hell!"
707,SHORT ROUND,707,"Willie, look!"
708,MOLA RAM,708,"No, the stones are mine!"
709,INDIANA,709,"You're betrayed Shiva. *(He re-
peats in Sanskrit Sankara's warn-
ing)"
710,INDIANA (Cont'd),710,*(He repeats Sankara's warning
711,WILLIE,711,"I guess Mola Ram got what he
wanted."
712,INDIANA,712,Not quite.
713,INDIANA (Cont'd),713,The last Sankara Stone.
714,WILLIE,714,And the diamond hidden inside...
715,SHAMAN,715,We know you are coming back --
716,SHAMAN,716,-- when life returns to our village.
717,WILLIE,717,It's a real miracle.
718,SHAMAN,718,"Now you see the magic of the
""rock"" you bring back."
719,INDIANA,719,"Yes, I've seen its power"
720,INDIANA,720,The last Sankara Stone.
721,WILLIE,721,"And they don't even know what
it really is."
722,INDIANA,722,"Well, you didn't get your prince,
and there goes your diamond."
723,WILLIE,723,"You didn't do so well yourself.
Finding that stone could've got-
ten you all the fortune and
glory you were talking about."
724,INDIANA,724,"It's still a long way to Delhi.
Who knows what might happen."
725,WILLIE,725,"Oh no, I'm finding a native guide
who knows the way.  No more de-
tours for me, thank you Dr. Jones."
726,WILLIE (Cont'd),726,"If you think I'm going to Delhi
or anyplace else with you, after
all the trouble you've gotten me
into..."
