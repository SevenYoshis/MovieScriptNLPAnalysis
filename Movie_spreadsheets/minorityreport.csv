1,FEMALE,1,"""Johnny, please.  Johnny please."""
2,FEMALE,2,You're scaring me.
3,MALE LEFT,3,"DADDY, DON'T. DADDY"
4,MALE LEFT,4,"I don't like you any more, Carol."
5,FEMALE,5,Put the scissors down.  You're
6,MALE RIGHT,6,"Oh, Carol."
7,FEMALE,7,Johnny!  Stop!
8,MALE RIGHT,8,Don't grab at me!  Let
9,MALE LEFT,9,Daddy!  No!
10,ALL THREE,10,Murderer!
11,JOHNNY,11,Why'd you let me sleep so long?
12,CAROL,12,"It's Saturday, Johnny, you always --"
13,CAROL,13,Why are you staring at me like that?
14,JOHNNY,14,"I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so
long."
15,JOHNNY,15,I didn't do anything!
16,OFFICER 1,16,"Come out of the closet on your hands
and knees."
17,OFFICER 1,17,Hands and knees!
18,JOHNNY,18,I didn't...
19,OFFICER 1,19,"John Palmer, if you were being
arrested for any other crime, I would
now read you your rights."
20,OFFICER 1,20,"But you are under arrest for the
future murderer of your wife, Carol
Palmer.  You have no rights."
21,WITWER,21,Thought we might a had a runner.
22,ANDERSON,22,"Yeah, a runner."
23,WITWER,23,A little chase -- that'd been good.
24,ANDERSON,24,"Fifty cops on the scene takes the
chase out of them."
25,WITWER,25,But only eight of us were real.
26,ANDERSON,26,"We ever get a runner, I'd be too old
to give chase."
27,WITWER,27,"You'd chase.  You'd love it,.  Man."
28,ANDERSON,28,"I love it more Johnny boy doesn't
get to murder his wife."
29,WITWER,29,It's a beautiful world.
30,LISA,30,"Jesus, Paul.  Your heart's hammering."
31,LISA,31,I excite you that much?
32,ANDERSON,32,I used to love being a cop.
33,LISA,33,"You're still a cop.  I'm a factory
worker.  We don't catch murderers.
We process them."
34,LISA,34,"You're the best homicide cop in the
country."
35,ANDERSON,35,"Great -- except there's no such thing
as homicide.  What I do best doesn't
exist anymore."
36,LISA,36,PAUL.
37,LISA,37,"You're the Director of a perfect
system.  A Cop with a perfect record"
38,ANDERSON,38,The
39,ANDERSON,39,"have a perfect record.
They identify the accused -- I just
put on my monkey suit and go round
them up."
40,LISA,40,And then
41,LISA,41,"prosecute them.  And they
go to jail.  And lives are saved.
Thousands of lives."
42,LISA,42,And that's a cop's dream.
43,ANDERSON,43,No.  You're a cop's dream.
44,ANDERSON,44,Who called?
45,LISA,45,"No one.  I called about my hair.
Getting it done this afternoon."
46,ANDERSON,46,"Come on in, neighbor.  Want some
coffee?"
47,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,47,Brought these for your supper.
48,LISA,48,"Oh, Frank.  That's so sweet.  Thank
you."
49,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,49,"Sweet, nothing.  I gotta get rid of
these things.  One plant, and I'm
invaded by tomatoes.  When I was a
kid ..."
50,ANDERSON,50,"Before all this genetically engineered
crap ..."
51,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,51,"Yeah well, it's true.  It used to be
a challenge to grow things.  An art.
Now you put one plant in the ground
-- then jump the hell out of the
way."
52,ANDERSON,52,Coffee?
53,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,53,"Nah, thanks.  Can't stay.  You guys
are rushing off to work anyway."
54,LISA,54,You and Ellie come for supper then.
55,ANDERSON,55,We'll barbecue.
56,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,56,"You betcha.  We'll bring some more
tomatoes -- a new batch will have
grown by then."
57,INTERCOM VOICE,57,"Yes, Director Anderson?"
58,ANDERSON,58,"Where's Ennis Page?  Why hasn't he
delivered this morning's Precog discs?"
59,INTERCOM VOICE,59,"I'll find him, sir."
60,WITWER,60,"Bullying the staff again, Director
Anderson?"
61,ANDERSON,61,Screw you.
62,ANDERSON (CONT'D),62,"Was that fun for you, yesterday?"
63,WITWER,63,The Johnny Palmer bust?
64,ANDERSON,64,Yeah.
65,WITWER,65,It was okay.  We got our man.
66,ANDERSON,66,When do we
67,ANDERSON,67,get our man?
68,PAGE,68,"Sorry I'm late, sir.  Precogs put
out a heavy national volume this
morning -- four for our zone."
69,ANDERSON,69,"Put the case on my desk, Ennis."
70,ANDERSON (CONT'D),70,What was I thinking.
71,ANDERSON,71,"Thanks, Ennis."
72,WITWER,72,Now that's a guy who
73,TOUR GUIDE,73,"Welcome to the main headquarters of
Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
are scattered throughout the United
States."
74,TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D),74,"Precrime was established in 2030,
with the harnessing of the remarkable
talents of the Precognitive mutants."
75,TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D),75,"Mr. Harris, can you tell me how many
Precogs there are?"
76,MR. HARRIS,76,"Three.  Uh, right?"
77,TOUR GUIDE,77,"That's exactly right!  A lot of people
assume there are Precogs in every
branch office."
78,TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D),78,"But there are only three Precogs,
right here in this building.  And
the information they give us, we
send out to all the other branches."
79,TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D),79,"And what is that information -what
do the Precogs do?"
80,TIMMY,80,They protect us.
81,TOUR GUIDE,81,"That's right, Timmy.  Because of the
Precogs, you're going to grow up
murderfree.  Isn't that something?"
82,MR. HARRIS,82,"They ever wrong?  The Precogs ever
screw up when they predict a murder?"
83,TOUR GUIDE,83,"sir.  It's an infallible
system.  The Precogs predict a
homicide, and our Precrime police
then apprehend that future murderer
before the event occurs.  And right
next door is the Judicial Center,
where we prosecute the
future murderers."
84,TIMMY,84,Can we see the Precogs?
85,TOUR GUIDE,85,"No, I'm sorry.  That part of the
building is not open to the public."
86,TOUR GUIDE,86,"Now, if you'll just step this way"
87,TOUR GUIDE,87,"to be eternally young, or"
88,ANDERSON,88,"What would they think about if we
unhooked them?"
89,PAGE,89,"They don't think, sir.  They just
see."
90,PAGE (CONT'D),90,"They're not even alive, really."
91,LISA,91,"Director Anderson, do you swear that
the disc you now present to the court
is the only and authentic disc of
the future murder of Carol Palmer by
her husband, John Palmer?"
92,ANDERSON,92,"Yes.  This is the only and authentic
disc of the event seen by the
Precognitive mutants and recorded by
the Precrime Division.  This is the
immutable evidence of the infallible
system."
93,LISA,93,The murder of Carol Palmer will occur
94,ANDERSON,94,"In one week -- June 16th, 2040 at
10:33 in the morning."
95,CAROL,95,"Johnny, please --"
96,JOHNNY,96,"""Johnny, please.  Johnny please."""
97,CAROL,97,You're scaring me.
98,JOHNNY'S SON,98,"DADDY, DON'T.  DADDY"
99,JOHNNY,99,"I don't like you any more, Carol."
100,CAROL,100,"Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
me. Please."
101,JOHNNY (O.S.),101,"Oh, Carol."
102,CAROL (O.S.),102,Johnny!  Stop!
103,JOHNNY (O.S.),103,Don't grab at me!  Let go...
104,JOHNNY'S SON (O.S.),104,Daddy!  No!
105,JOHNNY,105,"I didn't do it.  I'm innocent!  It
didn't happen!"
106,JUDGE,106,How does the defense plead?
107,DEFENSE ATTORNEY,107,"The defense acknowledges the
infallibility of the system.  We are
Guilty.  We throw ourselves at the
mercy of the court."
108,JOHNNY,108,No! No! The Precogs are wrong!  No!
109,WITWER,109,Looks like the old days.
110,ANDERSON,110,"That would be bad news for an
infallible system."
111,WITWER,111,"We know it can't be a murder -- the
Precogs would've seen it.  Why do
you insist on coming to these things?"
112,ANDERSON,112,"Keeps the system honest.  And besides,
I like to pretend I'm a cop."
113,ANDERSON (CONT'D),113,Who's got the Coroner?
114,OFFICER,114,"Right here, sir."
115,ANDERSON,115,Hi DOC.
116,HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR,116,"Hello, Director Anderson."
117,WITWER,117,"This a homicide, Doc?"
118,HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR,118,"I'm presently analyzing neurohormones,
Assistant Director Witwer.  I have
not concluded my examination."
119,HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D),119,"I'm detecting carbonization of skull
fragments around the entry wound."
120,WITWER,120,"Bingo.  The guy put the gun to his
own head."
121,HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR,121,"I have not determined that yet,
Assistant Director."
122,WITWER,122,"You have good ears for a ghost, Doc."
123,HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR,123,"Please rotate the corpse to the
lateral supine position."
124,WITWER,124,Can you imagine if this
125,WITWER,125,"a
homicide?  Who even knows how to
hunt down a killer any more?"
126,ANDERSON,126,"know how, dammit."
127,ANDERSON,127,know how.
128,WITWER,128,"Easy, partner."
129,WITWER,129,"But you know what I'm saying.  The
state legislatures are pushing to
stop funding for training homicide
detectives ..."
130,ANDERSON,130,God bless the Precogs.
131,HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR,131,"This event is a negative homicide.
A mortal wound was generated by a
.22 calibre bullet self-delivered to
the parietal 'portion of the skull
on June 10th, 2040, at 11:57 pm,"
132,HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D),132,"Eastern Standard Time.  This event
is a positive suicide."
133,WITWER,133,"It's time to stop coming to these,
partner."
134,ANDERSON,134,Yeah.  You're right.
135,ANDERSON,135,"A little bit of me dies every time I
come to one of these things."
136,LISA,136,"It's only a party, Paul."
137,ANDERSON,137,"I'd never have let them appoint me
to Precrime if I'd have known this
was going to be part of it."
138,LISA,138,"You're exactly what Precrime needed.
An amazing homicide cop and a real
person in an unreal job."
139,ANDERSON,139,Exactly.
140,LISA,140,"Precogs.  But they give people the
creeps, too.  You're something they
understandp a regular cop running
things."
141,ANDERSON,141,"Let's invite all these irregular
assholes over for a barbecue.  Burgers
and beer - think they'd come?"
142,SENATOR MALCOLM,142,"come, Mr. Director.  And I'd
make all the other assholes come
with me."
143,SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D),143,"Nice job this morning.  Another
negative homicide.  The Precogs never
let us down."
144,SENATOR MALCOLM,144,"I have a dream, Paul."
145,ANDERSON,145,"I know you do, Senator."
146,SENATOR MALCOLM,146,"Hundreds of Precogs.  Not just
predicting murders, but predicting"
147,SENATOR MALCOLM,147,"crimes.  Burglary, arson, assaults"
148,ANDERSON,148,"How about jaywalking?  Littering?
Now"
149,ANDERSON,149,a crime.
150,SENATOR MALCOLM,150,"I don't want a police state, you
know that.  But we have an opportunity
here, and"
151,ANDERSON,151,"No sir, we"
152,ANDERSON,152,"have that
opportunity.  There are only three
Precogs.  They're a lucky accident
of nature.  There are no more."
153,SENATOR MALCOLM,153,We can
154,SENATOR MALCOLM,154,"more.  Just give me your
support.  Help me increase funding
for the Precog Engineering Project."
155,ANDERSON,155,"Precogs aren't sheep or pigs.  Seeing
into the future is a gift, a
nonreproducible event."
156,ANDERSON (CONT'D),156,"There was only one Mozart, and there
are only three Precogs."
157,SENATOR MALCOLM,157,"Fuck Mozart.  The people want to be
safe.  They want that more than they
want food or love."
158,SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D),158,"Look at us -it's 2040 and we've
wrapped ourselves up in the 1950's
like a big security blanket.  Why?
Because we want to feel like they
felt.  Safe."
159,ANDERSON,159,"Senator, a world filled with hundreds
of Precogs is not my idea of a safe
place."
160,SENATOR MALCOLM,160,"Sure could use your help, Paul."
161,ANDERSON,161,"I decline, Senator.  I'm sorry."
162,SENATOR MALCOLM,162,"Don't think I'll come to your barbecue
after all."
163,DR. RESFIELD,163,You don't get out here much.
164,ANDERSON,164,Not my sort of place.
165,DR. RESFIELD,165,The head of Precrime squeamish?
166,ANDERSON,166,"When it comes to needles and scalpels,
yeah."
167,DR. RESFIELD,167,I promise we won't use any on you.
168,ANDERSON,168,What
169,ANDERSON,169,you use them on?
170,DR. RESFIELD,170,On bits of this and that.
171,ANDERSON,171,What's happening here?
172,DR. RESFIELD,172,We're in an interesting phase.
173,ANDERSON,173,What's in the cylinders?
174,DR. RESFIELD,174,Neurotissue.
175,ANDERSON,175,From ...?
176,DR. RESFIELD,176,"A fusion of sources.  From the
Precogs' deceased mother.  From the
Precogs themselves."
177,ANDERSON,177,A fusion of ... ?
178,DR. RESFIELD,178,"In lay terms, we mated sperm from
the brothers with ova from the mother
and sister to create new growth."
179,DR. RESFIELD (CONT'D),179,And then we add mutating variables.
180,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,180,"What are you doing, playing hooky?"
181,ANDERSON,181,"It's great out here, Frank.. You got
the touch."
182,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,182,"I got the arthritis, is what I got."
183,FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D),183,"Ah shit, neighbor."
184,FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D),184,"Goddamn Precogs don't miss a beat,
do they?"
185,FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D),185,"Can we do this inside?  Ellie's not
home."
186,ANDERSON,186,"Sure, Frank.  Yeah."
187,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,187,"I thought I'd buried it all.
Thirty-five years -- all those minutes
and days to bury it."
188,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,188,"But suddenly you see the man who
murdered your daughter walking the
streets -- my God it throws you."
189,ANDERSON,189,"He'd served his time, Frank.  I know
it's not fair.  It's way beyond not
fair ..."
190,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,190,"God damn the Precogs.  You know?
Why couldn't they have been around
to save my girl?"
191,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,191,Now they're catching me.
192,FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D),192,"I really shoot the bastard, huh?
When?"
193,ANDERSON,193,"Next Wednesday, at noon."
194,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,194,Good.
195,ANDERSON,195,"It's not in you, Frank, to kill
anybody."
196,FRANK D'IGRAZIO,196,"Tell it to the Precogs.  It's set in
stone now, right?"
197,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,197,"I don't want to be a part of this
world anymore."
198,ANDERSON,198,"I know, Frank."
199,FRANK D'IGNAZIO,199,"So.  Tell me, Paul.  Do the Precogs
see everything?"
200,ANDERSON,200,No.
201,FRANK D'IGRAZIO,201,Then they won't have seen this.
202,WITWER,202,We
203,WITWER,203,to bring him in.
204,WITWER (CONT'D),204,He was a future murderer.
205,ANDERSON,205,"You blame him?  The guy killed his
daughter!"
206,ANDERSON (CONT'D),206,Yeah.  I know.  I know.
207,ANDERSON (CONT'D),207,"I hate the Precogs, Ed. I believe in
them absolutely and I hate them
absolutely.  Jesus."
208,ANDERSON (CONT'D),208,"And that goddamn lab trying to grow
more of them.  Put a Precog in every
home, you know?  So we can have more
Franks - people shooting themselves --
over who knows what?"
209,WITWER,209,"Precrime did the job it was supposed
to do."
210,WITWER (CONT'D),210,You know it.  And you believe in it.
211,ANDERSON (BEAT),211,Yeah.
212,WITWER,212,"It's not easy.  It beats us down.
Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates
you right now."
213,ANDERSON,213,"That's why I got into this business
-- to be hated."
214,WITWER,214,"They hated us when we were regular
cops.  Now we're Precrime, and they
still hate US.  It's one of the little
perks of law enforcement nobody knows
about."
215,ANDERSON (O.S.),215,"Let's not do this, Ed."
216,ANDERSON,216,"Oh, Ed ..."
217,ANDERSON (CONT'D),217,I kill you.
218,ANDERSON (CONT'D),218,"Oh god, I"
219,ANDERSON (CONT'D),219,you.
220,ALL THREE,220,Murderer!
221,ANGELA,221,Sir?
222,ANDERSON,222,Come in.  Angela.
223,ANGELA,223,"Need you to sign these.  And your
eleven o'clock starts in five minutes."
224,ANDERSON,224,My ... eleven.
225,ANGELA,225,Budget coordination with the FBI.
226,ANGELA,226,"You okay, sir?"
227,ANDERSON,227,Have Page take this.
228,ANGELA,228,"But sir, the procedure"
229,ANDERSON (SNAPS),229,make procedure.  Call him.
230,ANDERSON (SNAPS),230,"I'm not okay, Angela ... you're right."
231,ANGELA,231,Yes sir.
232,ANDERSON,232,"I'll speak to Witwer, put him in
charge for the rest of the day."
233,WITWER,233,"Breaking and entering.  That'll get
you five to ten, hard."
234,WITWER (CONT'D),234,What's wrong?
235,WITWER,235,Paul?
236,ANDERSON,236,Take over for me today?
237,WITWER,237,You sick?
238,ANDERSON,238,Yeah.
239,WITWER,239,"Don't give it to me.  You probably
have that Trans-10 virus going around.
A stomach thing.  I hate stomach
things."
240,ANDERSON,240,Ed.
241,WITWER,241,Yeah?
242,ANDERSON,242,"Run the place, okay?"
243,WITWER,243,Sure.  Right into the ground.
244,WITWER,244,"Go on home before I call Infectious
Control and have them spray you down
with something."
245,WITWER (CONT'D),245,"You want me to do the discs, or hold
them for you to review when you get
back?"
246,ANDERSON,246,Can't let them back up.  Do 'em.
247,WITWER,247,"Call you later.  Take it easy, all
right?"
248,LISA,248,Paul?
249,ANDERSON,249,Listen to me.
250,LISA,250,I can hardly hear you.
251,ANDERSON,251,"I'm underground.  Weakens the signal
so it can't be picked up."
252,LISA,252,But we're on Secure
253,ANDERSON,253,"Listen, dammit!  I'm going to murder
Ed."
254,LISA,254,"Paul.  Paul His crackling voice
faintly comes through the phone."
255,ANDERSON'S VOICE,255,... home.
256,POLICE OFFICER,256,"Hello, sir."
257,ANDERSON,257,"What's your name, officer?"
258,POLICE OFFICER,258,"Bob, uh, Robert Smythe."
259,ANDERSON,259,These the new Python transports?
260,ANDERSON (CONT'D),260,"Sorry, Officer Smythe."
261,ANDERSON,261,Don't move.
262,ANDERSON (CONT'D),262,"Stop!  Moving heats you up, makes it
easier for them to pick you up on
their thermals."
263,LISA,263,It's a hundred degrees in here.
264,ANDERSON,264,"I turned the furnace all the way up.
Your hair dryer.  The oven.  If they
come, it'll buy me twenty seconds.
Maybe thirty."
265,LISA,265,Nobody's coming for you.
266,LISA (CONT'D),266,"On the phone -- what you said.  It's
impossible."
267,ANDERSON,267,I'm going to kill Ed Witwer.
268,LISA,268,It's
269,LISA (CONT'D),269,"You're upset.  You've been unhappy.
There's a lot of pressure on you.
And then Frank ..."
270,ANDERSON,270,"One week from today.  Tuesday, June
25, at five-twenty in the morning.
I"
271,ANDERSON,271,"him, Lisa."
272,LISA,272,You need to take time off.
273,ANDERSON,273,You don't have to worry about that.
274,LISA,274,I want to hold you.
275,ANDERSON,275,"If you love me, stand there.  And"
276,ANDERSON,276,move.
277,ANDERSON (CONT'D),277,"I saw the disc, Lisa.  I shoot him.
In the chest.  And he dies.  I've
watched a thousand murders.  This
time I star in one."
278,LISA,278,Something's
279,LISA,279,it.
280,ANDERSON,280,The Precogs are
281,ANDERSON,281,"emit a single disc.  ""The immutable
evidence of the infallible system."""
282,LISA,282,"We'll figure this out.  We'll review
the system."
283,ANDERSON,283,"There is no review.  There's only
the disc.  It Shows My guilt.  There's
no defense."
284,LISA,284,"You can't run.  Please, let's --"
285,ANDERSON,285,"Last week.  It was strange.  I watched
from the bathroom window.  You went
out in the"
286,ANDERSON,286,to make a call.
287,ANDERSON (CONT'D),287,"An appointment, you said.  For a
haircut that afternoon."
288,ANDERSON (CONT'D),288,"You didn't get your hair cut.  You
went to the trouble of calling first
thing in the morning.  It was"
289,ANDERSON (CONT'D),289,important ...
290,LISA,290,"Stop it!  Paul, please.  You're"
291,LISA,291,"look wrong.  You're going to distrust
everybody and everything now."
292,LISA (CONT'D),292,You

294,LISA (CONT'D),294,It was Ed I called.
295,ANDERSON,295,Ed.  why outside?  Why lie about it?
296,LISA,296,Stop being a cop and listen to me!
297,VOICE (O.S.),297,"Director Anderson!  There is no
escape!"
298,LISA,298,"Your birthday's tomorrow!  We wanted
to..."
299,VOICE (O.S.),299,"Drop to your hands and knees and
stay there.  Precrime is entering
your house!"

up my reading."

303,OFFICER 2,303,him.  A holograph decoy.
304,VOICE,304,Paul Anderson 0256 clear.
305,VOICE,305,"Enter now please, Assistant Director
Witwer."
306,CIA CRONIN,306,"The central question is: Why does
Anderson want to kill Witwer?"
307,CIA CRONIN (CONT'D),307,We checked your finances.
308,CIA CRONIN (CONT'D),308,"finances.  Nothing irregular, you
don't steal from him, he doesn't
steal from you.  You haven't done
anything that he might have
discovered, and vice versa."
309,FBI SWANSON,309,"Personnel checks reveal no ambitious
coups planned by you to topple him."
310,FBI SWANSON,310,"He's done nothing to you, or you to
him."
311,VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER,311,You fucking his wife?
312,WITWER,312,No.
313,FBI SWANSON,313,HIS MOTHER?  HIS BROTHER?
314,FBI SWANSON (CONT'D),314,Okay.  There we are.
315,JUSTICE POLLARD,315,"So, you are friends, partners, and
soul mates.  Anderson has no motive."
316,WITWER,316,I can't think of one.
317,WITWER,317,"Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs
are mistaken?"
318,JUSTICE POLLARD,318,"You don't believe that, do you?"
319,WITWER,319,No.  The Precogs are infallible.
320,SENATOR MALCOLM,320,"You're goddam right.  So, gentlemen
-screw the motive.  We got a
pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty
little PR problem."
321,VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER,321,"And here is our solution.  You are
now"
322,VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER,322,Witwer.
323,VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER (CONT'D),323,"Precrime must demonstrate its
willingness to go after one of its
own.  Total impartiality."
324,WITWER,324,Now
325,CIA CRONIN,325,"The public must believe that every
future murderer is pursued with equal
vigor."
326,FBI SWANSON,326,"Therefore, Precrime will put in charge
the man best suited to the job.  And
who would pursue a murderer harder
... than his intended victim?"
327,JUSTICE POLLARD,327,"You went after Anderson yesterday
-because it was right, and because
you"
328,VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER,328,"And your belief will certainly grow
stronger with each tick of the clock."
329,JUSTICE POLLARD,329,"Haw long will it take, Director?"
330,WITWER,330,"He knows Precrime, of course.  And
the streets -- he's rusty, but he'll
remember how to work them.  It'll
come back to him fast.  He's ... the
best."
331,JUSTICE POLLARD,331,"We're not here to praise Caesar --
we're here to bury him."
332,WITWER,332,"He can't avoid iris identification.
Every door he opens, every ATM he
uses, or taxi or transport he boards
-- he'll get scanned."
333,WITWER,333,It won't take long to find him.
334,TECHNICIAN,334,It's Anderson.
335,WITWER,335,Paul!
336,TECHNICIAN 2,336,"He's been Scanned.  He's on the 33rd
Street Subway!"
337,TECHNICIAN,337,"His cell phone tracks for The Sprawl.
We got him on the Subway, too!"
338,ANDERSON,338,"Why am I going to kill you,Ed?"
339,WITWER,339,There's no motive
340,ANDERSON,340,My wife calling you before breakfast?
341,WITWER,341,"We were planning a surprise party.
It was going to be today."
342,WITWER,342,"Happy birthday, partner."
343,ANDERSON,343,"This party's no fun, Ed. It's a hell
of a surprise, though."
344,ANDERSON,344,"I'm having trouble trusting people,
Ed, I gotta tell you."
345,OFFICER,345,"The train makes two stops, here and
here: 20th, then 33rd Street."
346,WITWER,346,"Split the units, go to both"
347,OFFICER,347,We'll never make 20th
348,ANDERSON,348,"You there, Ed?"
349,WITWER,349,"I'm here.  You gotta come in, Paul ."
350,ANDERSON,350,"I'm a Cop, Ed. I need a motive."
351,WITWER,351,"Come in.  We'll figure this thing
out together."
352,WITWER,352,"It'll get ugly if you keep running.
And your eyes, Paul -- every move
you make a Scanner will pinpoint you
for us."
353,ANDERSON,353,"I saw a news flash.  You're the new
Director.  Is"
354,ANDERSON,354,the point of this?
355,WITWER,355,Fuck you.
356,ANDERSON,356,Didn't think so.  But it has to be
357,ANDERSON,357,Ed.
358,WITWER,358,Paul.  Come in.
359,ANDERSON,359,"If I come in, it puts me close to
you.  If I get close ... I may kill
you.  I can't risk that."
360,ANDERSON,360,"Anyway, they'd force you to lock me
up.  And that'd be it -- I'd never
get my chance to solve this thing."
361,WITWER,361,"You're kinds liking this, in a way,
aren't you?  The action ..."
362,ANDERSON,362,"And you get to be a real cop again.
We get to flex our muscles."
363,ANDERSON,363,talking.  He isn't getting off
364,TECHNICIAN 2,364,"We have visual verification -- he's
still on the train."
365,ANDERSON'S VOICE,365,"I want to tell you something, partner.
You listening?"
366,WITWER,366,Yeah.
367,ANDERSON'S VOICE,367,"I gotta do this.  I have to figure
this thing out."
368,ANDERSON'S VOICE,368,But listen to me now.  If it was
369,ANDERSON'S VOICE,369,"running, I'd come after you, Ed."
370,ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D),370,"You're a cop.  And I'm a future
murderer."
371,ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D),371,"Do your job, Ed. Come after me"
372,ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D),372,"Because, Jesus Christ, I wouldn't
sleep or eat until I had tracked you
down and put a gun to your head."
373,WITWER,373,"You wouldn't shoot a cop would you,
Paul?"
374,WITWER,374,Paul?  Paul?
375,TECHNICIAN 1,375,He's still on the line.

chest, sew a dead cat in there, and
you'd never get an infection.  Not

381,ANDERSON (CONT'D),381,It's all I could safely move
382,DOC,382,Yeah.  All right.
383,DOC (CONT'D),383,"You understand what I told you then.
I can't just give you new irises.
The Scanners will read the scar
tissue.  Alarms will go off."
384,ANDERSOIN,384,"I'm a cop, I know"
385,DOC,385,I gotta take your eyes out.
386,DOC (CONT'D),386,And put in new ones.

390,DOC'S VOICE,390,"Don't take the bandages off for twenty
four hours.  You'll go blind if you
do."

here, a couple miles from my place.
If they find you, they don't find

minutes.  Hurts like nothing you
ever felt.  It's vicious, but
effective.  I'll put it in your bag."

buzzes tomorrow, take off your
bandages, and get the hell out of
here."
402,ANDERSON,402,"I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach."
403,ANDERSON (CONT'D),403,Guess I should eat.

413,WITWER,413,"They told me to move into Paul's
office.  I said fuck you very much."
414,WITWER (CONT'D),414,"I don't want to do any of this, Lisa."
415,LISA,415,I know.  I know that.
416,LISA (CONT'D),416,"Everybody's got their reasons for
wanting you in charge.  So do I --
you won't bring him in dead."
417,WITWER,417,Yeah.  But if he shoots a cop ...
418,WITWER,418,"Which is what he does four days from
now, isn't it?"
419,LISA,419,He'd never hurt you.
420,WITWER,420,"I know that.  But the other thing I
know is -- the Precogs are never
wrong."
421,DRIVER,421,"Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington.  Plenty
of seats in the back."
422,ANDERSON,422,"Time to upgrade your alarm system,
Senator."
423,ANDERSON (CONT'D),423,"Your work-up of Witwer.  The Security
Panel would've done one."
424,ANDERSON (CONT'D),424,Why do I kill Witwer?
425,SENATOR MALCOLM,425,There's no motive.
426,ANDERSON,426,"There's, always a motive."
427,ANDERSON (CONT'D),427,"I could've come to anyone on the
panel.  But I picked you."
428,ANDERSON (CONT'D),428,"Of all the shits on that panel, I
like you least of all.  So if this
gun goes off, I'll feel bad, but
not, you know, devastated."
429,SENATOR MALCOLM,429,"What the fuck was I worried about?
You can't kill me.  The Precogs
would've"
430,SENATOR MALCOLM,430,it.
431,SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D),431,"Witwer's clean.  You're clean.
There's nothing.  No motive.  Kind
of like something Kafka would've
cooked up."
432,SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D),432,"You like that, cockroach?  You're
fucked and you'll never know why."
433,ANDERSON,433,"Tell you something about the Precogs,
Senator.  They're great on murder.
But it's the little things they fail
to see."
434,ANDERSON (CONT'D),434,"Little things like that, for instance."
435,WITWER,435,"He hasn't shown up on one goddamn
IdentiScan in three days."
436,LIEUTENANT GLASER,436,"He's found a room -- he's going to
sit it out."
437,WITWER,437,"Yeah, except for holding a gun to
senator Malcolm's goddman head in
his own goddman house last night,
Anderson's sitting it out!"
438,WITWER,438,hasn't he been scanned?
439,WITWER (CONT'D),439,"Why is he invisible?  He's moving
around but he isn't being seen."
440,LIEUTENANT GLASER,440,Hes beating the scanners
441,WITWER,441,No one beats the scanners.
442,WITWER (CONT'D),442,He's done his eyes
443,LIEUTENANT GLASER,443,But the scarring always

blue eyes anymore.  The person who
faked this disc had no idea he would
change his eyes."
565,LISA (CONT'D),565,Listen!  But the
566,LISA (CONT'D),566,"disc has to
be real, because he has brown eyes
when he murders Witwer."
567,LISA (CONT'D),567,"Somebody tried to frame him with a
fake.  And somehow it all became"
568,LISA (CONT'D),568,"Why, Ennis?  How could this happen?"
569,LISA (CONT'D),569,"You handle the discs.  How did a
fake one get delivered?"
570,LISA (CONT'D),570,You want-- ?
571,PAGE,571,"He spilled coffee everywhere ...
Everywhere ..."
572,LISA,572,What coffee?  What are you -- ?
573,FEMALE,573,My brothers aren't here.
574,ANDERSON,574,"You didn't even look around.  You
knew."
575,FEMALE,575,"We can sense each other.  You must
save"
576,ANDERSON,576,Stop.  I saved
577,ANDERSON,577,I could do.
578,FEMALE,578,"Thank you, Anderson."
579,ANDERSON,579,What am I going to do with you?
580,FEMALE,580,"Name me, Anderson."
581,ANDERSON,581,What?
582,FEMALE,582,Give me a name.  I've never had one.
583,ANDERSON,583,Listen.
584,ANDERSON (CONT'D),584,Listen to me.
585,ANDERSON (CONT'D),585,Listen to me ... Rose.
586,FEMALE,586,Rose.
587,ANDERSON,587,"Rose.  They shifted your precognition
so you would locate me."
588,ROSE,588,"Yes.  And it hurt us, physically.
Did you know that?  The helmets, the
controls.  It"
589,ANDERSON,589,I didn't know.
590,ANDERSON (CONT'D),590,"When they shifted you to find me,
you didn't reveal everything.  That
I was going to break into Precrime."
591,ROSE,591,"We saw our chance.  You would need
to shut us down, you would have to
come.  We wanted you to come."
592,ANDERSON,592,You used me -- to save you.
593,ROSE,593,"have been used all my life,
Anderson."
594,ROSE (CONT'D),594,"No one cared that we were human.
From a human mother.  Taken at birth.
Hooked to machines."
595,ROSE (CONT'D),595,"We have been alive, Anderson.
Enslaved, for the greater good."
596,ROSE (CONT'D),596,"But now I have a name.  And I know
the man who has named - me will not
allow me to be enslaved again."
597,ANDERSON,597,"Rose.  What's going to happen to us?
Can you see that?"
598,ROSE,598,"I'm weak.  And away from my brothers.
I see glimpses and hints of things
nearby.  But it's all ... scattered."
599,ROSE,599,"I'm tired of the future, Anderson."
600,ANDERSON,600,"You didn't know I was going to do
that, did you?"
601,ROSE,601,"No.  Oh, Anderson.  It was lovely."
602,LIEUTENANT GLASER,602,Who else could it've been?
603,LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D),603,"He grabbed a Precog so he could commit
an undetected murder."
604,WITWER,604,"Page worshipped the system.  He fell
apart.  Shot himself."
605,LIEUTENANT GLASER,605,Anderson.
606,HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR,606,"Director Witwer.  This event is a
positive homicide."
607,HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D),607,"A mortal wound was generated by a
.38 calibre bullet delivered to the
left occipital portion of the anterior
skull, on June 16th, 2040, at 1:24
am, Eastern Standard Time.  A Phase
Two Investigation is in order."
608,LISA,608,There.
609,LISA,609,"The one on the left, the first disc
-it's a"
610,LISA,610,eyes anymore.
611,WITWER,611,A fake.
612,(BEAT),612,"But the Precogs predict the infallible
truth.  They don't emit fake discs."
613,LISA,613,"Precogs, induce them to make fakes"
614,LISA (CONT'D),614,"But that doesn't mean someone couldn't
have made a fake disc on their own
and inserted it into the delivery
system."
615,WITWER,615,"Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake
disc in with that day's real ones..."
616,LISA,616,"We're all programmed to believe
anything we see on a Precog disc.
The system has never been wrong ..."
617,LISA (CONT'D),617,"You have to call off the hunt.  He
was set up."
618,WITWER,618,"It's gone too far, Lisa She shakes
her head, shocked at his response"
619,LISA,619,He was set up!  You
620,LISA,620,"were.  If
Paul kills you, you're both out of
the picture."
621,WITWER,621,wants us out?  Of
622,WITWER,622,picture?
623,LISA,623,"Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing!  And
then we can investigate Witwer's
mouth opens and closes.  He tries
again."
624,WITWER,624,Ennis Page was murdered last night.
625,WITWER (CONT'D),625,Everything points to Paul.
626,LISA,626,He's
627,LISA,627,a murderer.
628,WITWER,628,"I think he is.  A murderer ... and a
future murderer."
629,WITWER,629,"Lisa.  What does it matter that the
first disc is a fake ... if the second
one's real?"
630,ANDERSON,630,"Rose.  Listen to me.  I'm going to
leave you here.  I have to keep
moving."
631,ROSE,631,No.  You must save my brothers.
632,ANDERSON,632,"It's impossible.  There's no time.
I've done what I can do!"
633,ROSE,633,"Come here, Anderson."
634,ROSE (CONT'D),634,"Do you see that boy in the blue hat
walking with his mother?"
635,ROSE (CONT'D),635,"In sixty seconds he will walk beneath
those workers installing a window on
the tenth floor of that building."
636,ROSE (CONT'D),636,"They'll drop the window, killing
him.  It is impossible to save him."
637,ROSE (CONT'D),637,to get to that boy ...
638,ROSE,638,"It was impossible to save that boy
-- but you"
639,ROSE,639,"Anderson.  It's in
you.  It's what you"
640,ANDERSON,640,You
641,ANDERSON,641,"it wasn't impossible.  That
I'd get there."
642,ROSE,642,You are a man who saves others.
643,ROSE,643,Save my brothers.
644,ANDERSON,644,I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
645,ROSE,645,"My brothers are in more trouble.
They've moved them to ... an awful
place."
646,ANDERSON,646,"Rose.  Ed Witwer -he's in the most
trouble of all.  Who saves"
647,DR. RESFIELD,647,"We're not really set up for this
type of"
648,ANDERSON,648,Rose.  Try to drink.
649,ROSE,649,"Your wife.  We have to get her here,
Anderson."
650,ANDERSON,650,Why?
651,ROSE,651,I don't know ...
652,ANDERSON,652,What are you seeing?
653,ROSE,653,"Anderson.  Please.  We
have to get her here."
654,ANDERSON,654,"You're scaring me, Rose"
655,ROSE,655,Stop talking.  It uses me up.
656,ROSE (CONT'D),656,"In three minutes your wife will take
a walk .."
657,SECRETARY,657,"Sir?  I'm sorry, she stepped out for
a few minutes."
658,SECRETARY,658,Sir?
659,LISA,659,Hello?  Hello?
660,ANDERSON'S VOICE,660,I need you.
661,ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D),661,"It's 1:03.  Set your watch, exactly."
662,ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D),662,This is what you have to do ...
663,ANDERSON (V.O.),663,"At 1:07 hang up the phone and enter
the Lawrence Museum."
664,ANDERSON (V.O.),664,"At 1:13 the two Precrime officers
following you take a wrong turn into
a different room, losing sight of
you for ten seconds."
665,ANDERSON (V.O.),665,"An undercover transport officer will
have received emergency orders to
follow you."
666,(MORE),666,"He's wearing a red tie.  He has short
blond hair."
667,ANDERSON (V.O.),667,"As you come around the bend, cry out
and turn around and slap the
officer..."
668,ANDERSON (V.O.),668,"Stay on Ninth street.  Underneath
Ninth street is the main power feed
for The Sprawl.  It'll mess up the
navigational beacon on the hovercraft."
669,ANDERSON (V.O.),669,"Keep switching taxis.  But stay on
Ninth."
670,LISA,670,"Two hundred dollars if you don't
scan me."
671,ANDERSON (V.O.),671,"The hovercraft will try to drop
altitude, but the air traffic will
slow it down."
672,ANDERSON (V.O.),672,"Precrime loses you.  You'll have to
walk two miles.  Don't get scanned."
673,MAN,673,"You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your
teeth out."
674,LISA,674,"Cut it a little close there,
honeybunch."
675,ANDERSON,675,"Rose got the street wrong.  She's
getting weak."
676,LISA,676,Rose?
677,ANDERSON,677,Two discs.  One fake.  One real.
678,LISA,678,"I don't think there were supposed to
be two.  Whoever planned it, wasn't
counting on two."
679,ANDERSON,679,"An infallible system.  Every disc
ever generated has been true ..."
680,LISA,680,"Somebody wants you out of the way --
so they make a fake disc.  Who ever
doubts the discs?"
681,ANDERSON,681,"never doubted it.  I saw it.  And
believed it, absolutely.  I was
certain I was going to murder Witwer."
682,ANDERSON (CONT'D),682,"I saw the fake, and believed so much
in the system, that I saw myself as
a murderer."
683,ANDERSON (CONT'D),683,"And the Precogs picked up those
thoughts ..."
684,LISA,684,"And generated the second disc.  The
real one."
685,ANDERSON,685,"A self-fulfilling prophesy.  I
believed it was true.  And"
686,ANDERSON,686,"made
it true."
687,ANDERSON (CONT'D),687,"Rose.  If all this is based on a lie
-the fake disc -- then do I really
kill Witwer?"
688,ROSE,688,"We see what we see.  I'm sorry,
Anderson.  It's been predicted."
689,LIEUTENANT GLASER,689,"We can't take chances, sir"
690,LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D),690,It happens in less than three hours.
691,LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D),691,"We put you in a hovercraft and keep
you airborne -- until after the event."
692,WITWER,692,The event.
693,LIEUTENANT GLASER,693,"I've been ordered to get you onto
the craft.  By force if necessary."
694,WITWER,694,"The event is inevitable, Lieutenant."
695,WITWER (CONT'D),695,"The Precogs are never wrong.  The
event will take place.  I'm a
believer.  Aren't you?"
696,LIEUTENANT GLASER,696,"I don't leave this room without you,
sir.  The Security Panel insists."
697,ANDERSON,697,"Nobody could slip a fake disc past
Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head."
698,LISA,698,"He was the weak link in the perfect
system."
699,ANDERSON,699,"Obsessive compulsive niners can't
allow changes in the routine"
700,LISA,700,Something threw him off.
701,LISA,701,"He tried to tell me.  It didn't make
any sense.  Something about ""spilled
coffee."""
702,LISA,702,"Someone was in his office with him.
And coffee spilled ..."
703,ROSE (V.O.),703,"We were always treated as if we
weren't alive.  As if we weren't"
704,ROSE (CONT'D),704,"Even now.  You forget that I'm here.
You talk between yourselves.  And
when you need me to see into the
future,"
705,ROSE (CONT'D),705,you turn to me.
706,ANDERSON,706,Rose.  What is it?
707,ROSE,707,"We weren't just lost in the future.
We were in the Chamber, too.  Our
eyes were open.  In the present."
708,ANDERSON,708,"Your eyes were open.  What did you
see, Rose?"
709,ROSE,709,"Who would I have told?  Who ever
talked to us?  Who cared that we
could talk?"
710,ANDERSON,710,"Rose.  Who spilled the coffee?
Straight ahead ..."
711,ROSE (V.O.),711,Ed Witwer entered Page's office.
712,ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D),712,"Page was so upset at the sight of
the coffee."
713,ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D),713,"Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket,
reached over Page and put it in one
of the open cases."
714,ROSE (CONT'D),714,"I didn't understand what I'd seen.
And I had no one to tell ..."
715,ANDERSON,715,Ed ...
716,LISA,716,"The perfect system -brought down by
a cup of coffee.  My god."
717,ANDERSON,717,"He set into motion his own death.
He didn't know it would go this far."
718,ANDERSON,718,"What makes me leave this room?  If I
stay here I won't kill him.  Right?"
719,WITWER,719,"You see, if you think you can put me
on a hovercraft and save me, then
you don't believe in the infallibility
of the Precog system."
720,WITWER (CONT'D),720,"And what I do not want around me,
are nonbelievers."
721,WITWER,721,Things quiet?
722,OFFICER,722,Sir.  Should you ... be here?
723,WITWER,723,"There's been a development.  A body's
been found in the Sprawl."
724,OFFICER,724,Anderson's?
725,WITWER,725,"They're checking it out.  I need to
see what the Precogs have seen."
726,WITWER,726,"Borrowed this from the technicians'
lounge.  You don't think they'll
mind, do you?"
727,DR.RESFIELD,727,"You shouldn't be here, Director."
728,WITWER,728,"No, no.  This is"
729,WITWER,729,"where I
should be."
730,DR. RESFIELD,730,"You're under a lot of strain,
Director."
731,WITWER,731,"And tv's so good for that -- soothes
the mind."
732,WITWER (CONT'D),732,"Bring me up to speed, Doc."
733,DR. RESFIELD,733,We're getting nothing from them.
734,WITWER,734,And that's because ... ?
735,DR. RESFIELD,735,I don't know.
736,WITWER,736,"Do you think they know where Anderson
is?"
737,DR. RESFIELD,737,It's impossible to tell.
738,DR. RESFIELD,738,We've done
739,DR. RESFIELD,739,too much.
740,WITWER,740,"They know how to find Anderson for
me."
741,WITWER (CONT'D),741,"They're the perfect machine, Doctor.
You just have to know which button
to push."
742,ANDERSON,742,Jesus Christ.
743,LISA,743,"Come on, Rose."
744,ANDERSON,744,"One hour.  We hold it together for
an hour, Witwer lives -- and I'm not
a murderer."
745,LISA,745,She won't last an hour.
746,ANDERSON,746,Rose!
747,ROSE,747,"He's killed him, Anderson!"
748,ROSE (CONT'D),748,You didn't save my brother.
749,ANDERSON,749,"Did he kill both of them, Rose?
Rose!"
750,ROSE,750,"Does it matter, Anderson?"
751,LISA,751,If you leave this room...
752,ANDERSON,752,"Then I'm a cop, just trying to do
hisjob."
753,WITWER,753,Is he coming?  No?  Yes?  Maybe?
754,WITWER,754,I think yes.
755,WITWER (CONT'D),755,And
756,WITWER (CONT'D),756,think yes.
757,WITWER (CONT'D),757,"Infallibly, immutably"
758,WITWER,758,"I figured, since I can see the future,
too, maybe I could get a little disc
action going."
759,WITWER,759,Just kidding.
760,WITWER (CONT'D),760,"You find you been doing that a lot
this week?  Looking at clocks?"
761,WITWER (CONT'D),761,Three minutes to go.
762,ANDERSON,762,"There's never anything good on, you
know?"
763,WITWER,763,There.
764,WITWER,764,the old Paul.
765,ANDERSON,765,"You're not the old Ed. You've lost
it."
766,WITWER,766,"lost it.  You went weak in the
knees, partner."
767,ANDERSON,767,I'm not your partner.
768,WITWER,768,"The air went out of you when Frank
D'Ignazio killed himself."
769,ANDERSON,769,He was guilty.  I accepted that.
770,WITWER,770,"you didn't.  The doubts were
creeping in on you.  The lab trying
to engineer more Precogs ... Malcolm
pressuring you to expand ..."
771,WITWER (CONT'D),771,"Belief is the basis of the system.
It was"
772,WITWER (CONT'D),772,"to be the ultimate
believer."
773,WITWER (CONT'D),773,"And when Frank died, you"
774,WITWER (CONT'D),774,"I'm a cop, I see into the hearts of
men."
775,WITWER (CONT'D),775,"And the thing about you is, you
wouldn't have just walked away."
776,ANDERSON,776,Never been my style.
777,WITWER,777,"Precrime needs to grow.  You would
have stood in its way.  The Security
Panel wouldn't have understood that.
What you're capable of.  What a"
778,WITWER,778,you are.
779,WITWER,779,"Look what you've been doing to us
all week.  Amazing.  You're the best."
780,ANDERSON,780,So you took matters into your own hands.
781,WITWER,781,"I understood the threat.  I understood
YOU"
782,ANDERSON,782,"You killed a Precog.  You ended the
system you wanted to protect."
783,WITWER,783,Wrong.  This lab will make more.
784,WITWER,784,Paul.
785,ANDERSON,785,"Knowing the exact moment of your
death -it's made you crazy, Ed."
786,WITWER,786,You sonofabitch!
787,WITWER (CONT'D),787,You didn't bring your gun!
788,ANDERSON,788,That's right.  No gun.
789,WITWER,789,"You see?!  That's exactly what I'm
talking about.  You don't Believe!"
790,WITWER (CONT'D),790,The system is
791,WITWER (CONT'D),791,"I guess that's why I've always carried
two."
792,ANDERSON,792,"You can't have it both ways.  You
don't want to die.  That's why you
lured me here -- to kill me first."
793,ANDERSON (CONT'D),793,"But it you don't diet the system is
flawed, and you couldn't live with
that."
794,WITWER,794,Pick it up
795,WITWER (CONT'D),795,"You're killing him, partner."
796,ANDERSON,796,"Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains
his gun on Anderson.  Anderson trains
his gun on Witwer."
797,ANDERSON (CONT'D),797,"Oh, Ed ..."
798,WITWER,798,Now do you believe?
799,ROSE,799,"James.  Can you guess what I'm
thinking?"
800,JAMES,800,NO.
