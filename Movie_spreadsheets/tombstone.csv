0,V.O. NARRATION,0,"""The economic explosion following
the Civil War created an
unprecedented nation-wide market
for beef.  Previously worthless
cattle running wild throughout
Texas were gathered into herds
And driven north to the railheads
In Kansas.  Fortunes were made as
Cowtowns sprang up on the
Prairies, wide-open centers of
Commerce and vice, their streets
Choked with heavily-armed young
Men fresh from the cattle drives.
In those days the correct term
For a cowhand was 'drover'.
'Cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was
originally an insult implying
deviant sexuality and was rarely
used.  But these invading drovers
were a wild breed for soon
shootings and wholesale drunken
riots became so frequent that
ordinary citizens literally could
not walk down the street.  In fact
at their height the cowtowns had
higher murder rates than modern
New York or Los Angeles and there
Was no law but that of the gun."""
1,V.O. NARRATION,1,"""Straight-up at 75 yards or eye-
to-eye at point-blank range, the
greatest gunman of all time was
an Illinois abolitionist farm boy
named James Butler Hickok, better
known as Wild Bill, the Prince of
Pistoleers.  But Wild Bill worked
His trade on the side of justice
And as marshal of cowtowns like
Hays City and Abilene he became a
Legend, the one man who stood
Between law and chaos."""
2,V.O. NARRATION,2,"""Wild Bill's fame spread nation-
wide but his end came quietly in
the spring of '76 when a strange
cross-eyed little drifter put a
bullet through the back of his
head, apparently for no other
reason than he wanted to kill a
celebrity."""
3,V.O. NARRATION,3,"""In Dodge City meanwhile, Wyatt
Earp and Bat Masterson were
Becoming known as fast-guns.  But
Their fame had nothing to do with
Shooting."""
4,V.O. NARRATION,4,"""Earp and Masterson operated more
like modern policemen, using
teamwork and persuasion to keep
order.  Still, sometimes things
got out of hand."""
5,V.O. NARRATION,5,"""But Wyatt had a guardian angel."""
6,V.O. NARRATION,6,"""John Henry 'Doc' Holliday was
the son of an aristocratic,
highly cultured southern family.
Trained in Philadelphia, he had
Embarked on a career as a society
Dentist when he contracted
Tuberculosis.  Advised to practice
In the west where it was thought
The climate and clean air would
Prolong his life, Doc soon
Realized it was all only a matter
Of time and gave up dentistry to
Become a professional gambler and
Gunman..."""
7,V.O. NARRATION,7,"""Others headed east.  Bent on
becoming an actress.  Josephine
Marcus defied her wealthy and
Very proper San Francisco Jewish
Family to run away with a
Traveling theatrical company,
Braving the perils of the
Frontier on her own.  Dangerous as
This might seem, it was another
Age and women were so rare, their
Presence so cherished that they
Could travel virtually anywhere
In the west in perfect safety."""
8,V.O. NARRATION,8,"""At about this time the Texas
Rangers, having eliminated the
Commanche threat, turned their
Attention to the outlaw gangs
Marauding along the Rio Grande,
Cleaning up the border strip in 4
Years of hard riding.  Those they
Could not indict or convict the
Rangers put down in their Black
Book, letting it be known that
They could either leave Texas or
Face summary execution.  This
Resulted in the mass migration of
The absolute dregs of the Texas
Underworld to the most dangerous,
Uncivilized part of the entire
Country, the southeast corner of
The Arizona Territory."""
9,V.O. NARRATION,9,"""Harsh and inhospitable, savaged
in turn by the Apache and Mexican
bandits, this had always been an
accursed place, a virtual hell on
earth where it was thought life
itself could never prosper, much"
10,V.O. NARRATION (cont.),10,"less civilization.  Then in 1879,
a prospector named Ed Schiefflin
set off alone into the Dragoon
Mountains.  Friends told him he
Was crazy, that the only thing
He'd find in this Godforsaken
Place would be his tombstone.
Instead he found silver, lots of
It, and overnight the town of
Tombstone sprang up.  Mining
Taking out millions in ore.  Land
Value shot sky-high and
Speculators and gamblers and
Opportunists of all nations
Scrambled in by the thousands to
Make Tombstone queen of the
Boomtowns, so rich that the
Latest Paris fashions, hard to
Find even in the biggest cities,
Were sold there by the wagonload
From the makeshift storefronts."""
11,V.O. NARRATION,11,"""Meanwhile, the exile Texans had
banded together to form the
nucleaus of an organized gang.
Seizing controp of the
Surrounding countryside they
Robbed stagecoaches at will while
The big absentee business
Interests employed them as tax
Collectors and strongarm men.  But
The backbone of their trade
Remained border rustling,
Periodic raids into Mexico to
Steal cattle while engaging in
What was described as a virtual
Orgy of murder and violence.  The
Raids became so frequent and so
Bloody that the Mexican
Government formally protested to
U.S. President Chester A. Arthur,
Prompting heated debate in
Congress.  General Sherman
Declared that the only possible
Way of bringing order was to send
In the army but in the wake of
Civil War Reconstruction federal
Intervention in civilian affairs
Was politically impossible."""
12,V.O. NARRATION,12,"""With only some 100 members, the
gang was an elite body of gunmen,
known by the red silk sashes they
wore around their waists.

Terrifying reputation and
Answerable to no one, they were a

Emerging as one of the earliest
Examples in American history of
Full-scale organized crime."""

The Old Man, Curly Bill, and Ringo rein up and look out at the
sun rising magnificently from the desert floor.  The Old man
stretches his legs in the stirrups, taking out a whiskey

Eyes on that brass ring."

You can see every star there is.
Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes
You think, you know?  I mean you
Look up and you think God made
All that but he still remembered
To make a little speck like me.
Kinda flattering really.  Hey,
Wyatt, you believe in God?  No,
Come on, really, do you?"
88,WYATT,88,"Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know."
89,MORGAN,89,"Well what do you think happens
When you die?"
90,WYATT,90,"Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I
Don't know."
91,MORGAN,91,"I read this book, book on
Spiritualism..."
92,VIRGIL,92,"Oh, God, here he goes..."
93,MORGAN,93,"...said a lot of people, when

A sign or what?"
95,MORGAN,95,"Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!"

Just ready to burst.  Well call me
A fool but I guess I'll just have
To call.  Cover your ears, darling."
110,BAILEY,110,God damn son of a...
111,DOC,111,Isn't that a daisy?
112,BAILEY,112,"Just pick up your money and go.
Sick of listening to you simper."
113,DOC,113,"Now Ed, are we cross?"
114,BAILEY,114,"Skinny lunger, your guns don't
Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns
You'd be nothin'."
115,DOC,115,"Why Ed, what an ugly thing to
Say!  Does this mean you're not my
Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if
I thought you weren't my friend I
Don't think I could bear it."
116,DOC,116,"There, now we can be friends
Again.  But remember, Ed,
Friendship is trust-so please
Don't hurt me."

This town.  And let's don't bother
About the luggage, darling."

Hotel pack us up every night
Since your streak started"
124,DOC,124,"My sweet clever Magyar, so that's
Why you're not wearing a bustle."

I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just
Hit town?"

These're my brothers-"
128,BEHAN,128,"Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?"
129,WYATT,129,Gave all that up.  Going into business.
130,BEHAN,130,"Well I'm the man to see.  Besides
Sheriff I'm also tax collector,
Captain of the Fire Brigade, and
Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti-
Chinese league.  A man of many
Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I
Also sit on the Townlot
Commission.  Got a couple of
Lovely cottages coming up for
Rent.  Here, let me show you..."
131,BEHAN,131,"The one next door and the one
Across the street are vacant too.
Same rent and I'll throw in a
Good cleaning.  Believe me, you
Won't find a better deal within
Town limits."
132,WYATT,132,Guess we'll take all three.
133,WYATT,133,"...and easy on the grain, I don't
want 'em too fidgety."
134,MORGAN,134,"Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal."
135,WYATT,135,Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
136,WHITE,136,"Who, Behan?  He ain't no law, only
Real law here's the Cowboys."
137,VIRGIL,137,"The Cowboys, yeah.  I heard of 'em."
138,WHITE,138,"Nobody does nothin' without 'em.
They're it.  Hell, even the
Apache're scared of 'em.  There's
A couple right there: Sherman
McMasters and Pony Deal.  Can
Always spot a Cowboy, they all
Wear those red sashes."
139,VIRGIL,139,Look pretty rough.
140,WYATT,140,"Just like any other hard cases.
Gotta know how to handle 'em."
141,WHITE,141,"Well I'm no Wild Bill.  Way I
Handle 'em's just mainly live and
Let live.  That usually answers
But even so, gets kinda spooky
Sometimes.  Still somebody's gotta
Do it, I mean how the hell else
You gonna walk down the street?"
142,VIRGIL,142,"Doesn't anybody raise a stink?
The hell kinda town is this?"
143,WHITE,143,"Boomtown.  Wide open.  People
Grabbin' with both hands ain't
Got time for any law and order.
In fact the less law the more
Opportunities there are for
Makin' money.  Plain fact is the
Cowboys're good for business."
144,WYATT,144,What about all these saloons?
145,WHITE,145,"Ah, now that's the real mother-
Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down
Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours
A day, liquor, hostesses,
Gamblin', makin' money hand over
Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On
Account of the element.  Have a
Man for breakfast in there most
Days.  Regular slaughter house.
High-rollers won't go near it.
Too bad, nice place."
146,JOYCE,146,What can I get you?
147,WYATT,147,Let me have one of those cigars.
148,WYATT,148,Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
149,JOYCE,149,"Milt Joyce, owner-operator."
150,WYATT,150,"Well, excuse me for askin', Milt,
But isn't it kinda dead in here?"
151,JOYCE,151,"You see that bird at the faro
Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He
Barged in here one day, said he
Was takin' over the game, started
Slappin' customer, wavin' his
Gun around, scarin' off all the
High-class play.  Only trade comes
In here now's just bummers and
Drovers, just the dregs."
152,WYATT,152,"Why don't you get rid of him and
Get yourself straight dealer?"
153,JOYCE,153,"Well sure, neighbor, easy to say."
154,TYLER,154,"You back that Queen again, you
Son of a bitch, I'll blow you
Right out of that chair!"
155,TYLER,155,Somethin' on your mind?
156,WYATT,156,"Just wanted to let you know
You're sitting in my chair."
157,TYLER,157,That a fact?
158,WYATT,158,Yeah.  It's a fact.
159,TYLER,159,"For a man that don't go heeled
You run your mouth kinda reckless."
160,WYATT,160,"Don't need to go heeled to get
The bulge on a dub like you."
161,TYLER,161,That a fact?
162,WYATT,162,Yeah.  It's a fact.
163,TYLER,163,Well I'm real scared.
164,WYATT,164,"Damn right you're scared.  I can
See it in your eyes."
165,WYATT,165,"Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that
Smoke wagon and see what happens."
166,TYLER,166,"Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-"
167,WYATT,167,"I'm getting tired of your gas.
Jerk that pistol and go to work."
168,WYATT,168,"I said throw down, boy."
169,WYATT,169,"You gonna do something or just
Stand there and bleed?"
170,WYATT,170,"No, I didn't think so.  Here,
Milt.  Keepsake, hang it over the
Bar.  All right, youngster.  Out
You go..."
171,WYATT,171,And don't come back.  Ever.
172,WYATT,172,See how easy that was?
173,WYATT,173,"Well we're off and running.  Just
Acquired us a quarter-interest in
The game at the Oriental."
174,VIRGIL,174,Acquired?
175,WYATT,175,So to speak.
176,O.S. VOICE,176,"Why Johnny Tyler, you madcap,
Where are you going with that
Shotgun?"
177,TYLER,177,Doc.  I didn't know you were in town.
178,WYATT,178,Doc!  How the hell are you?
179,DOC,179,"Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect."
180,TYLER,180,Wyatt?  Wyatt Earp?
181,MORGAN,181,"Going into business for
Ourselves.  Wyatt just got us a
Faro game."
182,DOC,182,Since when is faro a business?
183,WYATT,183,"Didn't you always say gambling's
An honest trade?"
184,DOC,184,"I said poker's an honest trade.
Only suckers buck the tiger.  The
Odds are all with the house."
185,WYATT,185,"Depends how you look at it.  I
Mean it's not like anybody's
Holding a gun to their heads."
186,DOC,186,"That's what I love about Wyatt.
He can talk himself into anything."
187,DOC,187,"Oh sorry, Johnny, I forgot all
About you.  You can go now.  Just
Leave the shotgun."
188,TYLER,188,Thank you.
189,WYATT,189,"Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday."
190,DOC,190,Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
191,BEHAN,191,So how's Tombstone treating you?
192,WYATT,192,"Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin',
You know what this town really
Needs is a race track."
193,BEHAN,193,"Actually, you know, that's not a
Bad idea, send a signal we're
Growing up."
194,DOC,194,"Little ahead of yourselves,
Aren't you?  This is just a mining
Camp."
195,BEHAN,195,"See how everyone dresses?  Awfully
Toney for a mining camp.  No, the
Die's cast, we're growing, be as
Big as San Francisco in a few
Years.  And just as sophisticated."
196,DOC,196,I can hardly wait.
197,DRUNK,197,You son of a bitch!
198,JOHNSON,198,"That's right, keep comin', keep comin'..."
199,DOC,199,Very cosmopolitan.
200,WYATT,200,I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
201,VERMILLION,201,"Easy, gents. Private affair..."
202,VERMILLION,202,Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
203,WYATT,203,Jack...
204,DRUNK,204,You bastard!
205,JOHNSON,205,"Yeah, good.  Right about there."
206,JOHNSON,206,"Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!"
207,WYATT,207,What was that all about?
208,VERMILLION,208,"Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called
Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing."
209,DOC,209,"Sheriff, may I present a pair of
Fellow sophisticates, Turkey
Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack
Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek."
210,WHITE,210,'Fraid I'll have to have those guns.
211,JOHNSON,211,Fair fight.  We were legal.
212,WHITE,212,"Sorry, boys.  Gotta take you
Before Judge Spicer."
213,VERMILLION,213,"Well law and order every time,
That's us."
214,VIRGIL,214,What kinda town is this?
215,VERMILLION,215,Nice scenery.
216,BEHAN,216,"That must be the theatrical
Troupe.  There's a show tonight at
Schieffelin Hall."
217,JOHNSON,217,"Hey, Wyatt, you goin' to the
Show?  Maybe we'll see you there."
218,JOHNSON,218,Won't we.
219,WHITE,219,"Yeah, probably."
220,DOC,220,"Well, an enchanted moment"
221,JOSEPHINE,221,"Interesting little scene.  I
Wonder who that tall man was."
222,1ST ACTRESS,222,"Typical frontier type.  Long and
Lean.  And those gray eyes.  Like a
Wild hawk.  You see quite a few of
His type out here."
223,JOSEPHINE,223,"Oh, I want one."
224,HUNT,224,"Hey, Sister Boy!"
225,CURLY BILL,225,"Shut up, Zwing.  Sit here, Billy."
226,ALLIE,226,"This is so much fun!  We haven't
Been to a show since years."
227,MATTIE,227,I hope they're good.
228,STILLWELL,228,"Lady, they better be good."
229,DOC,229,"Kate, you know the Earps."
230,WHITE,230,"Wyatt, this is Mayor Clum and his wife."
231,CLUM,231,Your reputation precedes you.  I wonder -
232,WYATT,232,Not a prayer.  Nice meetin' you.
233,WHITE,233,"Well everybody's here except the
Old Man.  Got the blade, Billy
Grounds, Zwing Hunt, Billy
Claiborne, Wes Fuller, Tom and
Frank McLaury, Billy Clanton's
The youngest.  Wild one.  Then the
Breeds, Hank Swilling, Pony Deal.
Florentino's Mex-breed.  They all
Hate Mex, but he hates 'em
Special.  Johnny Barnes, Frank
Stillwell.  That's Behan's little
Deputy, Billy Breakenridge.
Follows the Cowboys around like a
Puppy.  And the big boys: Curly
Bill Brocius, he's the Old Man's
Rimrod; the one looks like an
Actor, that's Johnny Ringo.  Best
Gun alive they say.  He's kinda
Different.  Curly Bill's the only
One he talks to.  I mean they're
All rough boys, but Ringo... I
Don't know.  I really don't"
234,BARNES,234,"Professor Gilllman?  Oh hell, I
Seen him in Bisbee.  He catches stuff."
235,STILLWELL,235,Hey profesor!  Catch this!
236,GILLMAN,236,They shot me!  I don't believe it!
237,1ST ACTRESS,237,"My God, they're shooting at us!
They're actually shooting at us!
What'll we do?"
238,FABIAN,238,"Only thing we can do, dear-be
Good.  In any event, at least we
Won't have to wait for our
Notices.  Exciting, isn't it?  Now
This is theater!"
239,CURLY BILL,239,Prettiest man I ever saw
240,STILLWELL,240,How come he ain't wearin' no pants?
241,BARNES,241,That's how come.
242,FABIAN,242,"Ladies and gentlemen, the St
Crispin's Day Speech from Henry V.
To set the Scene, England is
Now at war with France.
Everything rests upon the battle
About to begin.  Henry, the young
King of England, addresses his men
Thusly: ""My cousin Westmorland?
No, my fair cousin-"""
243,FABIAN,243,"""If we are marked to die, we are
enow/ To do our country loss; and
if to live./ The fewer me, the
greater the share of honour..."""
244,BARNES,244,"He's got nerve, I'll say that.
What do you think, Billy?"
245,BREAKENRIDGE,245,"Oh, he wonderful!"
246,GROUNDS,246,"Uh-oh, looks like somebody's in love."
247,CURLY BILL,247,Let him alone.
248,FABIAN,248,"""We few, we happy few, we band of
brothers;/ For he today that
sheds his blood with me/ Shall be
my brother; be he ne'er so vile./
This day shall gentle his
Condition;/ And gentlemen in
England now a-bed/ Shall think
Themselves accurs'd they were no
Here./ And hold their manhood
Cheap whiles any speaks/ That
Fought with us upon Saint
Crispin's day!"""
249,CURLY BILL,249,That's great!  That's our kinda stuff!
250,STILLWELL,250,He's gonna some up short on that one.
251,CURLY BILL,251,"Know what I'd do?  I'd take the
Deal then crawfish and drill that
Ol' Devil in the ass.  How 'bout
You, Johnny?  What would you do?"
252,RINGO,252,I already did it.
253,DOC,253,Very instructive
254,WYATT,254,But who was the Devil?
255,MORGAN,255,It's that woman from the coach!
256,WYATT,256,I'll be damned...
257,DOC,257,You may indeed.  If you get lucky.
258,WYATT,258,"Comin' to the Oriental, Virge?"
259,ALLIE,259,"Not tonight! Tonight me and my
Old man're gonna have some fun.
Get moving, old man!"
260,VIRGIL,260,Her maiden name was Sullivan.
261,WYATT,261,"Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's
Where I leave you."
262,MATTIE,262,"No, stay.  Please stay with me."
263,WYATT,263,"Honey, I gotta start makin' money."
264,MATTIE,264,"Oh, all right."
265,WYATT,265,"Well I guess I don't have to go
Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while."
266,MATTIE,266,"No, no, I don't want to keep you."
267,WYATT,267,"No really, I can stay a while."
268,MATTIE,268,"Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt,
Really.  Work well."
269,WYATT,269,"All right, well, good night."
270,HIGH ROLLER,270,"All right, I'm on fire!  Black
Seven, seven stickin' spades.
Let's go!"
271,WYATT,271,I'm your man...
272,WYATT,272,"You win again.  Well played, sir.
You are on fire."
273,HIGH ROLLER,273,"Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm
Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven
Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five
Thousand!  Let's go!"
274,WYATT,274,Awful lot of money.
275,HIGH ROLLER,275,"Can't take the heat, get outta
The kitchen."
276,WYATT,276,You're the doctor.
277,WYATT,277,"sad news, friend."
278,HIGH ROLLER,278,"Damn!  All right, wait a minute..."
279,WYATT,279,"So now we're in the mining
Business.  Turning into regular
Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the
Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a
Kick out of that, it's her maiden
Name."
280,DOC,280,"And what a maiden, pure as the
Driven snow, I'm sure."
281,MORGAN,281,Hey Doc!  Come on now.
282,WYATT,282,"Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't
Mean anything."
283,DOC,283,"So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious.
Do you actually consider youself
A married man?  Forsaking all
Others?"
284,WYATT,284,"Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I
Was no angel when we met but
People change Doc.  I mean sooner
Or later you gotta grow up."
285,DOC,285,"I see.  And what would you do if
""she"" walked in her right now?"
286,WYATT,286,"""She""?"
287,DOC,287,"You know damn well who I mean.
That dusky-hued lady Satan."
288,WYATT,288,I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
289,DOC,289,Ignore her?
290,WYATT,290,"I'd ignore her.  People can
Change, Doc."
291,DOC,291,I'll remember you said that.
292,WYATT,292,"Oh, hell..."
293,WYATT,293,Satisfied?
294,DOC,294,"I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're
An oak."
295,WHITE,295,"Since when'd you start servin'
Ladies in here?"
296,JOYCE,296,Actresses.  It's different.
297,BREAKENRIDGE,297,"Here, Mr Fabian, have this table."
298,FABIAN,298,"Oh, thank you.  You're very kind."
299,BREAKENRIDGE,299,"Mr. Fabian, I've got to tell you,
That's the most wonderful thing I
Ever saw.  What was that?"
300,FABIAN,300,"Henry's all right but he's no
Match for the Melancholy Dane."
301,FABIAN,301,"Hamlet, dear friend, the supreme
Role of any actor worth his salt."
302,DOC,302,"Here's a man you should meet, Mr.
Fabian.  Excellent character study
For you, the real-life actual
Melancholy Dane."
303,FABIAN,303,"Indeed, sir?  How so?"
304,DOC,304,"Well he hems, he haws, he talks
Out of both sides of his
Mouth-but all on a very high
Plane, just like Hamlet."
305,WYATT,305,"Getting drunk, Doc."
306,CURLY BILL,306,"Wyatt Earp, huh?  I heard of you."
307,IKE,307,"Listen, Mr. Kansas Law-dog.  Law
Don't go around her.  Savvy?"
308,WYATT,308,I'm retired.
309,CURLY BILL,309,Good.  That's real good.
310,IKE,310,"Yeah, that's good, Mr. Law-dog,
'cause law don't go around here."
311,WYATT,311,I heard you the first time.
312,CURLY BILL,312,"Shut up, Ike."
313,RINGO,313,And you must be Doc Holliday.
314,DOC,314,That's the rumor.
315,RINGO,315,"You retired, too?"
316,DOC,316,Not me.  I'm in my prime.
317,RINGO,317,"Yeah, you look it."
318,DOC,318,"And you must be Ringo.  Look,
Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The
Deadliest pistoleer since Wild
Bill, they say.  What do you
Think, darling?  Should I hate him?"
319,KATE,319,You don't even know him.
320,DOC,320,"Yes, but there's just something
About him.  Something around
The eyes, I don't know, reminds me
Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I
Hate him."
321,WYATT,321,He's drunk.
322,DOC,322,In vino veritas.
323,RINGO,323,Age quod agis.
324,DOC,324,Credat Judaeus Apella.
325,RINGO,325,Ecentus stultorum magister.
326,DOC,326,In pace requiescat.
327,WHITE,327,"Come on now.  We don't want any
Trouble in here.  Not in any language."
328,DOC,328,"Evidently Mr. Ringo's an educated
Man.  Now I really hate him."
329,WHITE,329,"See what I mean about it getting
Spooky?"
330,WYATT,330,"Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that
Other idiot?"
331,WHITE,331,"Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest
Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff,
Makes him miserable."
332,WYATT,332,"Yeah, and dangerous."
333,JOSEPHINE,333,The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
334,BEHAN,334,"That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a
Name for himself as a peace
Officer in Kansas."
335,JOSEPHINE,335,A peace officer... Impressive man
336,BEHAN,336,"Yes, very.  And very married."
337,JOSEPHINE,337,"Oh, so that's it..."
338,CURLY BILL,338,"I feel like doin' somethin'.
Getting woolly."
339,CURLY BILL,339,"Hey, Chinky!  Come here a minute..."
340,KATE,340,"That's my lovin' man.  Just can't
Get enough."
341,DOC,341,Enough?  Never.
342,HIGH ROLLER,342,"Hey, is that ""Old Dog Tray""?
Sounds like ""Old Dog Tray""."
343,DOC,343,What?
344,HIGH ROLLER,344,"You know, Stephen Foster.  ""Oh,
Susanna"".  ""Camptown Races"",
Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!"
345,DOC,345,"I see, well this happens to be a
Nocturne."
346,HIGH ROLLER,346,A which?
347,DOC,347,"You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin."
348,MORGAN,348,"Now that wounds me.  Little tin
Swain walkin' off with that black
Beauty.  I mean I'm a married man
And all but still, it ain't right."
349,CURLY BILL,349,"Boy, I feel great!  Full of that
Hop I got from Chinky.  I feel
Just capitol!  You boys go ahead.
I'm gonna stick around awhile,
Howl at the moon."
350,WHITE,350,"Curly Bill.  He's over across the
Street shootin' out the lights."
351,CLUM,351,"This is great, this is just great."
352,BEHAN,352,"Have you been out in the street?
Somebody's got to do something."
353,CLUM,353,You're the Sheriff.
354,BEHAN,354,"It's not County business, it's a
Town matter."
355,WYATT,355,Why don't you just leave it alone?
356,WHITE,356,"No, I gotta do something.  I don't
Suppose you'd card-"
357,WYATT,357,"None of my business, Fred."
358,WHITE,358,"Hey, Curly?  Come on now, boy..."
359,CURLY BILL,359,"Well, howdy, Fred!"
360,WYATT,360,Maybe I ought to go out there.
361,DOC,361,"You will or you won't.  Don't look
To me.  I'm going to sleep."
362,WYATT,362,Go wake up Virgil.
363,WYATT,363,"Hey Milt, lend me a sidearm, will you?"
364,WHITE,364,Hand that over.  Come on now.
365,CURLY BILL,365,"Why sure, dad.  I'm only in fun.
Here she is."
366,WYATT,366,Put his clothes out.
367,IKE,367,Turn loose of him.
368,WYATT,368,He just killed a man.
369,BILLY,369,He said to turn loose of him.
370,WYATT,370,Well I'm not so go home.
371,IKE,371,"Swear to God, Mister, step aside
Or we'll tear you apart."
372,WYATT,372,You.  Come here a second.
373,WYATT,373,"You die first, get it?  The others
Might get me in a rush but before
That I'm gonna make your head
Into a canoe.  Understand?"
374,BILLY,374,He's bluffin'!  Let's rush him!
375,O.S. VOICE,375,"And you, you simpleton, you're next."
376,BILLY,376,"Hell, he can't hit nothin'.  He's
So drunk he's probably seein'
Double."
377,DOC,377,I have two guns.  One for each of you.
378,VIRGIL,378,"All right, look out!  Break it up.
Go home, all of you, go home now..."
379,WYATT,379,"Come on, you..."
380,CURLY BILL,380,"Crack me back of the head like
Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you
Ain't no fightin' man, you're
Just a cop."
381,WYATT,381,There.  He'll keep till morning
382,VIRGIL,382,"Keep your eye on that brass ring.
Don't let anything side-track you."
383,WYATT,383,"I know, I need a keeper."
384,BEHAN,384,"Well I guess you can see, never a
Dull moment.  Maybe you should
Stay around to see what happens
Next.  Who know?  You might find a
Future here."
385,JOSEPHINE,385,Maybe even my destiny.
386,WYATT,386,"...but he says did I actually see
it happen and I said, no, when I
arrived Fred'd already been shot.
So the judge said, can't have a
Murder without a witness-case
Dismissed.  Can you beat it?  After
All that.  Oh hell, who cares,
None of my business anyways."
387,MORGAN,387,"Boy, I love this game.  When we're
Finally set we gotta each have a
Billiard room in our houses."
388,CLUM,388,"Excuse me, Wyatt, just a moment,
Please, I wanted to try and
Reason with you.  We still haven't
Found a Marshal and-"
389,VIRGIL,389,"Come on Mayor, he already told
You no."
390,CLUM,390,What about you?  You were a lawman.
391,VIRGIL,391,"I'm busy.  We're all busy.  Sorry,
Mayor, but you're really barkin'
Up the wrong tree."
392,WYATT,392,"You tell 'em, Virge."
393,WYATT,393,"You know, I was thinkin', maybe
We ought to open our own place.
That's the real money.  Build it
Up, milk it for all it's worth,
Then sell it off for a bundle and
Breeze out of this burg with more
Money than Croesus and ready to
Live like kings.  Let's you and me
Take a walk around town, Virge,
See if we can scout us out a
Couple of nice lots."
394,VIRGIL,394,"I can't hardly believe it.  It's
Working out just like you said,
Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg
Six ways through Sunday."
395,WYATT,395,"Pretty fun too, isn't it?"
396,VIRGIL,396,"Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit."
397,VIRGIL,397,"What're you up to today, son?"
398,WYATT,398,Cat got your tongue?
399,WYATT,399,"Wait a minute, Virgil!  Where you goin'?"
400,VIRGIL,400,"I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I
Looked at that woman and it was
Just like somebody slapping me in
The face.  I mean these people're
Afraid to even walk down the
Street and I'm trying to make
Money off it like some kind of
God damn vulture.  That's not me,
That's somebody I don't even know."
401,WYATT,401,"Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me."
402,VIRGIL,402,"It's got nothin' to do with you,
Wyatt.  It's-"
403,WYATT,403,"Nothing to do with me?  I'm your
Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I
Don't believe this."
404,WYATT,404,"Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him."
405,WYATT,405,"Oh no, don't tell me..."
406,MORGAN,406,"Like you said, Wyatt.  We're
Brothers.  Gotta back your
Brother's play.  Just did like I
Figured you would."
407,WYATT,407,"Listen to me, both of you.  This
Is no good.  This is trouble we
Don't need.  For the first time in
Our lives we got a chance to stop
Wandering and finally be a
Family.  Do this and you throw it
All away.  You saw what happened
To Fred White."
408,MORGAN,408,"Come on, we're not about pickin'
Fights.  Just gonna keep a little
Order, that's all."
409,WYATT,409,Yeah?
410,MORGAN,410,"Like you said, just gotta know
How to handle 'em.  Old Fred
Wasn't up to it.  We know that
We're doin', Wyatt."
411,WYATT,411,"All right, say you're right, say
You don't get yourself killed.
There's something else."
412,WYATT,412,"It's too late for Virge, he
Already rolled his bone.  But it's
Not too late for you, Morg."
413,MORGAN,413,What're you talkin' about?
414,WYATT,414,"All the years I worked the
Cowtowns, I was only ever mixed
Up in one shooting.  Just one.  A
Man got killed.  Wasn't my fault,
Just doin' my job.  I don't even
Know if it was my bullet that
Dropped him, but... I don't kno,
It's sort of hard to explain.  At
First I just felt funny, you
Know, kind of clammy inside.  But
When it finally sunk in what I'd
Done... Believe me, boy, you
Don't ever want to feel that way.
Not ever."
415,WYATT,415,"Didn't even make a dent, did I?"
416,WYATT,416,You're both makin' a big mistake.
417,WYATT,417,This Hooker's ranch?
418,HOOKER,418,That's right.  And I'm Hooker.
419,WYATT,419,"You seen anything of a man on
Horseback leading a black
Stallion?"
420,WYATT,420,"Well you must've seen somethin',
The trail runs right by your
Waterhole."
421,WYATT,421,"Oh, I see.  So it must've been a
Cowboy, right?  Really got you
People treed, don't they?"
422,HOOKER,422,"Look, Mister, it's fine for you
Boomers to court trouble, you're
Just passin' through.  Us
Cattlemen gotta live here.  Best I
Can do's point you up to the cut.
That's their roost."
423,MCMASTERS,423,"Run for your lives, boys!  It's
That great two-gun dog-catcher
From Kansas!"
424,WYATT,424,"McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you
Seen a black stallion with-"
425,MCMASTERS,425,"Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk
To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither."
426,WYATT,426,"I'm not a lawman, I'm just a
Private citizen getting' my
Property back"
427,MCMASTERS,427,"Well in that case, I saw your
Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin'
Him up to the Cut to show him
Off.  The boys're all up there
Right now, branding.  And in a
Mood.  Still want your property
Back, Mr. Private Citizen?"
428,WYATT,428,So what about you Cowboys anyway?
429,MCMASTERS,429,"If I had to explain it you
Wouldn't understand.  Just say
We're brothers to the bone."
430,WYATT,430,"Yeah, but some of the things they
Say your brothers've done..."
431,MCMASTERS,431,"There's all kinds of horses,
Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys.
What they do's their affair.  I
Don't preach and I don't judge.  I
Ain't no dog-catcher."
432,MCMASTERS,432,"You seem like a nice fella.  Like
To've know you better.  Had you lived."
433,IKE,433,"Hey, law-dog.  The hell you doin' here?"
434,SWILLING,434,"How 'bout I just drag you off
That horse and eat you blood raw?"
435,WYATT,435,Where'd you get that horse?
436,BILLY,436,"Beauty, ain't he?"
437,WYATT,437,I asked where you got him.
438,BILLY,438,Where do you think?  I stole him.
439,WYATT,439,"Look, I don't want any trouble
With you but that's my horse and
I mean to have him back.  One way
Or another."
440,BILLY,440,Come and get him.
441,WYATT,441,"Look kid, I know what it's like,
I was a kid, too.  Even stole a
Horse once.  But you can't--"
442,IKE,442,"Don't sweet-talk him, make a move."
443,SWILLING,443,"Yeah, go ahead, Mister.  Make a move."
444,CURLY BILL,444,"Give him his horse, Billy."
445,IKE,445,"Come on, Curly!  Don't let him-"
446,CURLY BILL,446,"Shut up.
Give him his horse, Billy."
447,CURLY BILL,447,"Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just
Can't hold back when I'm feelin'
Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad.
But now we're square.  Anyway no
Use for holdin' a grudge.  I
Deserved a rap in the head."
448,WYATT,448,"Make you a deal.  My brother took
Over the Marshal's office in
Tombstone.  Got it in his head
He's gonna make the place safe
For widows and orphans.  You and
Your boys stay out of his way,
I'll make sure he stays out of yours."
449,CURLY BILL,449,"Fair enough.  You know I got to
Admit, you got a lot of bark on
You comin' up here like this."
450,WYATT,450,"They were all gonna jump me back
There.  What ever happened to one
Against one?"
451,CURLY BILL,451,"Ain't our way.  We go all on one,
One on all.  Fight one of us, you
Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way."
452,WYATT,452,"And how come you call yourselves
Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand."
453,CURLY BILL,453,"Oh, we ride for a brand all right."
454,CURLY BILL,454,This brand.  How 'bout you?
455,WYATT,455,This brand.
456,CURLY BILL,456,We're gonna get along just fine.
457,CLUM,457,"I can't thank you enough.  Since
You took over there hasn't been a
Single problem.  We're finally
Becoming a civilized town."
458,VIRGIL,458,Nothin' to it.
459,WYATT,459,"Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe
Those Cowboys aren't near as bad
As they're painted.  You know I
Was thinkin', there's a lot of
Money in the cattle business..."
460,VIRGIL,460,"Wait a minute, you thinkin' of
Getting in bed with the Cowboys?"
461,WYATT,461,"Business is business.  Don't have
To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not
If there's money in it."
462,VIRGIL,462,"You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are."
463,YOUNG RURALE,463,The old one you kill.  This was my father.
464,OLD MAN CLANTON,464,"What, and I'm supposed to
Tremble?  Kiss my ass, Messican."
465,STILLWELL,465,"Old Man Clanton's dead!  Ambushed
In Guadaloupe Canyon.  Messican's
Got him."
466,CURLY BILL,466,"All right, first thing's first:
It's my outfit now, I'm runnin'
The show.  Ringo's number two man."
467,IKE,467,Your outfit?  I'm next in line.
468,CURLY BILL,468,"You ain't got enough in your
Britches.  Think you can prove
Otherwise, go ahead."
469,CURLY BILL,469,Anybody else?
470,CURLY BILL,470,"All right.  Billy, go after Ike
And cool him off then go find the
McLaurys, tell 'em what happened
And keep an eye on things.  Wes
Fuller and Bill Claiborne, too.
Rest of you come with me.  We're
Goin' to Mexico."
471,WYATT,471,"Oh, hell..."
472,JOSEPHINE,472,"Well, hello."
473,WYATT,473,"We've never actually met.  My
Name's-"
474,JOSEPHINE,474,"Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was
Beginning to think we'd never
Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That
Means lucky."
475,WYATT,475,I know what it means.
476,JOSEPHINE,476,What is it?
477,WYATT,477,Easy now... That mare's in season.
478,JOSEPHINE,478,Oh...
479,JOSEPHINE,479,Now she's starting.  How do they know?
480,WYATT,480,"They know.  It's the scent.  We
Better split 'em up."
481,JOSEPHINE,481,"I have a better idea, let's run
It out of them!"
482,WYATT,482,"Yeah, I'm an oak all right."
483,WYATT,483,"You're not that crazy, are you?"
484,JOSPEHINE,484,"Oh, yes I am!"
485,JOSEPHINE,485,That was lovely!
486,WYATT,486,"You know you almost got us both
Killed back there?"
487,JOSEPHINE,487,"Fun though, wasn't it?"
488,WYATT,488,You'd die for fun?
489,JOSEPHINE,489,"Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I
Was sure you never laughed."
490,WYATT,490,I laugh sometimes
491,JOSEPHINE,491,"Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are
You happy?"
492,WYATT,492,"Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy
As the next man, I guess.  I don't
Laugh all day long like an idiot,
If that's what you mean."
493,JOSEPHINE,493,You're a little touchy about it.
494,WYATT,494,"I'm not touchy, I just, it's a
Silly question, that's all.  Am I
Happy?  Are you happy?"
495,JOSEPHINE,495,"Of course, I'm always happy.
Unless I'm bored.  That blonde
Woman, is that your wife?"
496,WYATT,496,What about her?
497,JOSEPHINE,497,"Nothing... Tell me, what do you
Want out of life?"
498,WYATT,498,Where do you get these questions?
499,JOSEPHINE,499,Just answer.
500,WYATT,500,"I don't know, make some money,
Have some kids, you know."
501,JOSEPHINE,501,Doesn't suit you.
502,WYATT,502,How would you know?
503,JOSEPHINE,503,"Just doesn't, that's all."
504,WYATT,504,"Well I ought to know my own mind
And I'm tellin' you what suits me
Is a family and kids.  That suits
Me right down to the ground.  In
Fact, that's my idea of heaven."
505,WYATT,505,"All right, what's your idea of heaven?"
506,JOSEPHINE,506,Room service.
507,JOSEPHINE,507,"See?  You're laughing again.  But
That's what I want.  Go places and
Move and never look back and just
Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea
Of heaven.  Need someone to share
It with, though."
508,WYATT,508,You mean Behan?
509,WYATT,509,Then why are you with him?
510,JOSEPHINE,510,"Well he's handsome and he's
Charming.  He's all right.  For
Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm
Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've
Tried to be good but it's too
Boring."
511,WYATT,511,"The way you talk.  Never heard a
Woman talk like that."
512,JOSEPHINE,512,"Oh look, I haven't got time to be
Proper, I want to live.  I'm a
woman, I like men.  If that's
Unladylike then I guess I'm not a
Lady.  At least I'm honest."
513,WYATT,513,"Well you're different, no arguing
That.  But you're a lady all right.
I'll take my oath on it."
514,JOSEPHINE,514,What's wrong?
515,WYATT,515,"I don't know, doesn't make any
Sense.  I almost can't look at
You.  Like it hurts."
516,JOSEPHINE,516,"I know, me too.  What should we do
About it?"
517,WYATT,517,God...
518,JOSEPHINE,518,"You know this is adultery.  You
Burn in hell for that."
519,WYATT,519,"Then let's make sure we get our
Money's worth"
520,JOSEPHINE,520,"I must say this certainly has
Been an unexpected little
Windfall."
521,WYATT,521,Fortuitous even.
522,JOSEPHINE,522,And I don't even know your full name.
523,WYATT,523,Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
524,JOSEPHINE,524,"And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus.
My friends call me Josie."
525,WYATT,525,"Josie... No, I'm gonna call you
Sadie."
526,JOSEPHINE,526,I hate Sadie.
527,WYATT,527,Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
528,JOSEPHINE,528,Always?
529,WYATT,529,Getting late.  We better get back.
530,JOSEPHINE,530,"So I assume we're regarding this
As just a kind of interlude."
531,WYATT,531,"Look, it's too much of a tangle.
I already cast my lot.  I can't go
Back and I can't sneak, feel back
Enough as it is."
532,JOSEPHINE,532,You feel bad about this?  About me?
533,WYATT,533,I didn't mean it that way.
534,JOSEPHINE,534,"You know you don't have to sneak.
You could stay with me.  I know
Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I
Could make you so happy."
535,WYATT,535,"I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me."
536,FLY,536,"What mood would you like for this
Picture, Miss Marcus?  Any
Particular occasion you're
Commemorating?"
537,JOSEPHINE O.S.,537,"I want to remember exactly how I
Looked on this day so I want you
To take a picture of me..."
538,JOSEPHINE,538,...all of me.
539,JOSEPHINE,539,Because I'm wonderful.
540,WYATT,540,"That the bottle Lou gave you?
Better go easy on that stuff."
541,MATTIE,541,"I know what I'm doing.  Where have
You been?"
542,WYATT,542,Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
543,MATTIE,543,I don't know.  I'm all right.
544,WYATT,544,Really?  You sure?
545,MATTIE,545,Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
546,WYATT,546,"Well, I was thinking, we've
Already made a pile of money.
Maybe we should just pull up
Stakes and move on.  And we could
Stay on the move, you know?  Just
Keep going, see the world.  Live
On room service the rest of our
Lives.  How'd that be?"
547,MATTIE,547,"Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?"
548,WYATT,548,Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.
549,JOYCE,549,New singer.  Ain't she somehin'?
550,MORGAN,550,"Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours.
Clanton came in an hour ago, they
Switched over to poker.  Tried to
Get him to bed but he just won't
Let go."
551,WYATT,551,I know.  And nobody can make him.
552,DOC,552,Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
553,WYATT,553,"Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc."
554,DOC,554,"Nonsense, I have not yet begun to
Defile myself."
555,WYATT,555,But Doc-
556,DOC,556,"I won't be pawed at, thank you
Very much"
557,WYATT,557,"Sorry, sorry..."
558,KATE,558,"That's right.  Doc can go all day
And all night and then some.
Doc's my man.  Doc's my lovin'
Man.  Have another one, lovin' man."
559,BEHAN,559,What d'you think of the singer?
560,WYATT,560,Nice voice.
561,BEHAN,561,That's not what I meant.
562,IKE,562,"Son of a bitch!  That's twelve
Straight hands!  Nobody's that lucky."
563,DOC,563,"Why, Ike, whatever do you mean?"
564,VIRGIL,564,"Come on, boys, take it easy."
565,DOC,565,"Maybe poker's not your game, Ike.
I know, let's have a spelling
Contest!"
566,IKE,566,I'll wring your scrawny neck for you!
567,VIRGIL,567,"That's enough, Clanton."
568,IKE,568,"You takin' his part?  I'm the one
Was cheated. God damn pimps,
You're all in it together."
569,VIRGIL,569,"Nobody's in anything, Clanton,
You're drunk.  Go home and sleep
It off."
570,IKE,570,"Get your God damn hands off me!
Don't you ever put your hands on
One of us!  Don't you ever try to
Man-handle a Cowboy!  We'll out
Your God damn pimp's heart out!
Understand, pimp?"
571,VIRGIL,571,"Don't you threaten me, you
Little-"
572,WYATT,572,"Virgil, don't!  Take it easy!  Ike,
Just go home and forget it, will you?"
573,IKE,573,I ain't forgettin' nothin.
574,BEHAN,574,"I saw that look on your face just now.
What's between you and Wyatt?"
575,JOSEPHINE,575,Absolutely nothing.
576,DOC,576,"Well that certainly was a bust.  I
Want my money back.  Come,
Darling, let's seek our
Entertainment elsewhere."
577,KATE,577,"What's wrong, Doc?"
578,DOC,578,"Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right
As the mail."
579,WYATT,579,"Get a doctor!  Virgil, give me a hand."
580,IKE,580,What's wrong with him?
581,JOYCE,581,Lunger.
582,DR. GOODFELLOW,582,"Your condition is quite advanced.
I'd say you've lost some 60 percent
Of your lung tissue.  Maybe more."
583,DOC,583,So what does that mean?
584,DR. GOODFELLOW,584,"Two years, two days, hard to say.
If you have any chance, it's to
Stop now-smoking, drinking,
Gambling, night-life.  You must
Have a healthy diet and most
Importantly, you must have
Complete rest-meaning you must
Attempt to deny your marital impulse."
585,DOC,585,"Well, that sounds inviting."
586,DR. GOODFELLOW,586,Sorry but I'm afraid you've no choice.
587,KATE,587,"How you feeling, Doc?"
588,DOC,588,Better.
589,KATE,589,That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.
590,DOC,590,"We must talk, darling.  It appears
We have to... redefine the nature
Of our association."
591,KATE,591,"What's that mean, Doc?  You know I
Don't understand when you talk up
High like that.  You mean you
Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?"
592,DOC,592,Not exactly...
593,KATE,593,"I'm a good woman to you, Doc.
Don't I always take care of you?
Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm
A good woman."
594,DOC,594,"Yes, I know.  You are a good woman."
595,DOC,595,"Then again, you may be the
Antichrist."
596,IKE,596,Bastards think they can cheat me?
597,JOYCE,597,"Nobody cheated you, Ike.  Go home."
598,IKE,598,"And I don't take no mouth from
Any bartenders neither.  There,
See?  Give somebody a rap on the
beezer, get some God damn respect
Around here.  Now you tell the
Earps and Doc Holliday if I see
'em on the street, I'm gonna send
'em all to hell on a shutter.  You
tell 'em that."
599,WYATT,599,What the hell's going on?
600,IKE,600,I want to send a telegram.
601,VIRGIL,601,"Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and
Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six
Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream."
602,WYATT,602,"Just stay calm, use your head.
It'll be all right.  Just the
Same, though..."
603,WYATT,603,Guess you better swear me in.
604,MATTIE,604,"Thought you swore you'd never
Carry that thing again."
605,WYATT,605,"Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things."
606,BEHAN,606,"I'm terribly afraid this looks
Like the end of the Earp brothers."
607,VIRGIL,607,Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
608,WYATT,608,"Easy, Virge, they're just tryin'
To egg us on."
609,MORGAN,609,"What're you doin' out of bed, Doc?"
610,DOC,610,"What the hell's going on?  I've
Had five people walk up to me
Saying the Clantons and McLaurys
Are gunning for me."
611,FRANK,611,Like to teach those bastards a lesson.
612,BILLY,612,Probably already scared them to death.
613,TOM,613,"You call it, Ike.  What're we gonna do?"
614,IKE,614,Gimme that.
615,JOYCE,615,"Those Cowboys're tellin'
Everybody in town they're gonna
Clean you out.  They're down in
That lot right now behind the OK
Corral."
616,WYATT,616,"Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem.
You don't have to mix up in this."
617,DOC,617,"That's a hell of a thing for you
To say to me."
618,VIRGIL,618,What the hell're we gonna do?
619,WYATT,619,"Wait till the liquor wears off.
Once they start getting headaches
They'll lose interest."
620,VIRGIL,620,"Wyatt, they're threatening our lives."
621,WYATT,621,You'll never make that stick.
622,VIRGIL,622,They're carrying guns in town.
623,WYATT,623,"Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You
Go down there to arrest 'em,
Something goes wrong, maybe this
Time somebody gets his head
Broke, suddenly it's a mess and
It won't end there, you'll have
Cowboys comin' around lookin' for
Trouble from here to Christmas.
You gonna risk all that over a
Misdemeanor?"
624,VIRGIL,624,"No, damn it, it's wrong, they're
Breakin' the law."
625,WYATT,625,"All right, Virge, your call.  But
Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be
Less apt to get nervy if they see
Him on the street howitzer."
626,WYATT,626,"Well... Come on, boys."
627,BEHAN,627,They're on their way over here.
628,JOHNSON,628,There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
629,VERMILLION,629,Yeah.  Or undertakers.
630,WYATT,630,"Virge, you're makin' the arrest.
You make contact, I'll back you
Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll
Keep an eye out for trouble.  And
Keep your hands on your guns.
They even look like they're gonna
Start something, buffalo 'em.
Right over the head."
631,VIRGIL,631,"Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'."
632,WYATT,632,"Look at 'em all.  They love it.
How in the hell'd we get
Ourselves into this?"
633,BEHAN,633,"You don't have to worry about a
Thing.  I just went down there and
Disarmed them."
634,VIRGIL,634,"You did?  Great, thanks.  Come on, boys."
635,WYATT,635,"Oh, great.  Disarmed my ass..."
636,VIRGIL,636,"We've come to arrest you.  Throw
Up your arms!"
637,VIRGIL,637,Hold!  I don't want that!
638,WYATT,638,"Oh, my God..."
639,IKE,639,"No, no, please!  I don't have a gun!"
640,WYATT,640,"This fight's commenced.  Get to
Fightin' or get away!"
641,MORGAN,641,I'm hit.
642,WYATT,642,Behind us!
643,BEHAN,643,Come on!
644,FRANK,644,"I got you now, you son of a bitch!"
645,DOC,645,You're a daisy if you do!
646,BILLY,646,More cartridges!  Somebody load my gun...
647,BEHAN,647,"All right.  You're all under
Arrest."
648,WYATT,648,"I don't think I'll let you arrest
Us today, Behan.  Maybe tomorrow."
649,DOC,649,You call that shooting?
650,FLY,650,"The McLaurys are both dead.  Billy
Clanton's just about gone."
651,WYATT,651,Guess we did our good deed for today.
652,WYATT,652,I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
653,CURLY BILL,653,"I know.  Just did what you had to.
That banner and stuff, that's
Just Ike.  Don't worry about it."
654,CURLY BILL,654,Don't worry about a thing
655,WYATT,655,"How you doin', boy?"
656,MORGAN,656,Fine.  Better.
657,MORGAN,657,"You were right.  It's nothin' like
I thought.  I almost wish..."
658,WYATT,658,"I know, kid.  I know.  Me too."
659,CURLY BILL,659,"Here's to the memory of Billy
Clanton and Tom and Frank
McLaury.  They went out real
Cowboys, dead game right up to
Their last kick.  They won their
Places at the big table with Davy
Crockett and Wild Bill and Old
Man Clanton.  They're up there
Right now tradin' shots with 'em.
And they'll never be forgot.  Not
Ever.  Hundred years from now
There'll be men settin' around a
Campfire, passin' a bottle,
Tellin' stories about those boys.
They're what you call immortal.
And I say God bless 'em."
660,CURLY BILL,660,"All right, first we hang back,
Just bide away till everybody
Thinks this's blown over.  Then..."
661,WYATT,661,Mattie.  What about this?
662,MATTIE,662,I need it.
663,WYATT,663,'Least you admit it.
664,MATTIE,664,"Admit what, I'm an opium fiend?
No, Wyatt, I just said I need it.
I need something to keep me warm
At night."
665,WYATT,665,"Look, Mattie, I know you're-"
666,MATTIE,666,"You know nothing.  What you don't
Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I
Feel like it's when you're around
I need it most.  You're never
Yourself, you never relax.  Never.
Everything's so stiff and dead.
You always have to keep a rein on
Everything, ever yourself.  Oh,
You smile sometimes, I've even
Seen you laugh.  But there's no
Light in your smile for me,
Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm.
And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold."
667,MATTIE,667,What's between you and that Jew woman?
668,WYATT,668,"All right, look.  I can make it
Right, I can make this up to you,
Mattie.  I can, I swear."
669,MATTIE,669,"Will you go to her and tell her
Right in front of me she's
Nothing to you?  Right out loud so
I can hear?  Tell her she's
Nothing, tell her she's nobody,
Just dirt?  Will you do that?"
670,MATTIE,670,"Until you can do that we've got
Nothing to talk about, Wyatt.
Nothing.  Now leave me alone."
671,BEHAN,671,"Listen, I want to talk to you."
672,JOSEPHINE,672,Not now.  I don't have time.
673,BEHAN,673,"I saw that look pass between you
And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to
Me!  You're mine!  Understand?
You're my woman and I'm your man."
674,JOSEPHINE,674,"My man?  You told Wyatt you'd
Disarmed those men.  Do you
Actually believe after that I
Could see you as my man?  You're
Just a dirty little fixer."
675,BEHAN,675,You whore!  You filthy whore!
676,MORGAN,676,"You don't talk that way to a
Female human being!  Not ever!"
677,BEHAN,677,"Look, I don't want to take
Advantage of an injured man but
You better-"
678,CURLY BILL,678,"So she's Wyatt's slice now.  Looks
Like we got another name for the
Tally book."
679,MORGAN,679,"Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry
If I made a worse mess for you."
680,WYATT,680,"I'm the one made a mess.  Made a
Right fair mess of the whole thing."
681,VIRGIL,681,Getting warmer.  Guess spring's comin'.
682,MORGAN,682,"Hello, Billy.  I say hello, Deputy."
683,BREAKENRIDGE,683,"I don't want to talk to you.  Those
Men you killed were my friends.
I'm just a nothing, but if I
Wasn't I'd fight you, I'd fight
You right now.  So I don't wanna
Talk to you."
684,WYATT,684,All they ever did was make fun of him.
685,O.S. VOICE,685,Sister Boy should've stuck around.
686,VIRGIL,686,"What d'you want, Ringo?"
687,RINGO,687,"I want your blood and I want you
Souls and I want them both right now."
688,WYATT,688,"Don't want any more trouble, Ringo."
689,RINGO,689,"Well you got trouble and it
Starts with you."
690,WYATT,690,"I'm not gonna fight you, there's
No money in it.  Sober up.  Come
On, boys."
691,RINGO,691,"Wretched slugs, don't any of you
Have the guts to play for blood?"
692,O.S. VOICE,692,I'm your huckleberry.
693,DOC,693,That's just my game.
694,RINGO,694,"All right, lunger.  Have at it."
695,DOC,695,On three?  You call it.
696,RINGO,696,Here it come: one-two-
697,CURLY BILL,697,"Johnny, don't, Jesus!  Come on,
Son..."
698,CURLY BILL,698,Never mind.  He's drunk.
699,RINGO,699,I want them spitting blood!
700,CURLY BILL,700,"Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time."
701,CURLY BILL,701,"I tell you, boys, even I'm
Worried what'll happen once Ringo
Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!"
702,RINGO,702,"There's no God, there's no devil,
I hate the God damn world!  I want
To die!"
703,CURLY BILL,703,"Easy, son.  You just need to get
Your feet back under you, that's
All.  Come on, boy, let's kick
South.  Down to the old playground."
704,CURLY BILL,704,"See son, there is a God after all!"
705,VIRGIL,705,Gonna be one of those nights.
706,CURLY BILL,706,"All right, boys.  Now's the time
To get woolly."
707,BEHAN,707,"Easy.  I just wanted to tell you
Things're about to start changing
Around here.  Lots of so-called
Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger
Around this town but none of
'em's got a clue about the real
play.  None of 'em."
708,JOSEPHINE,708,I don't understand.
709,BEHAN,709,You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
710,ALLIE,710,"God, it's a cold night.  Come up
To the fire, Mattie."
711,LOUISA,711,It looks like a woman.
712,JOSEPHINE,712,"Please, I know it's awful me
Coming here, but listen, I can't
Say why, but I think something is-"
713,ALLIE,713,Now who in... It's another woman.
714,JOSEPHINE,714,No!  Look out!
715,MAN'S VOICE,715,Everybody dies!
716,VIRGIL,716,Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
717,WYATT,717,"Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there."
718,MORGAN,718,That thunder's sure somethin'.
719,WYATT,719,That didn't sound like thunder.
720,WYATT,720,Virgil?
721,VIRGIL,721,Wyatt...
722,VIRGIL,722,Wyatt!
723,DR. GOODFELLOW,723,"I'm afraid your husband's been
Very badly hurt.  I had to remove
The entire left elbow joint.  What
That means is, well I'm afraid-"
724,ALLIE,724,"Oh, no, no, no, NO!"
725,VIRGIL,725,"No, no, don't worry, honey.  I
Still got one arm left to hug you with."
726,WYATT,726,"It's all my fault.  If I hadn't been
So damn smart, if I'd just... Oh
God, Virge, I'm so sorry."
727,ALLIE,727,"Look, Wyatt, I don't want to talk
Right now."
728,WYATT,728,"Virgil, what am I going to do?"
729,VIRGIL,729,"For God's sake, just leave me alone."
730,ALLIE,730,He doesn't want to talk now.
731,MCMASTERS,731,"No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin'
I say'll fix things but I want
You to know it wasn't me."
732,WYATT,732,"No?  Brothers to the bone, right?"
733,MCMASTERS,733,"Not anymore, not after this."
734,MORGAN,734,"Get down, boy."
735,WYATT,735,"Morgan, are you crazy?  They're
Out gunning for us!  What the
Hell're you doin'?"
736,MORGAN,736,"What's it look like?  They want a
Piece of me they can come and get
It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole."
737,WYATT,737,"Morg, use your head."
738,MORGAN,738,"I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been
Wonderin' how the hell we got in
This tangle.  You know they hit
Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife.
His wife.  Who ever heard of
That?  Men sneakin' around in the
Dark, back-shootin', scarin'
Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You
Know all your smart talk about
Live and let live?  Ain't no live
And let live with bugs."
739,WYATT,739,"I know, I was wrong.  But Morg,
Look, we got to get out."
740,MORGAN,740,"Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie
Down and crawl or you might get
Hurt?  What kinda talk is that?
That's Virgil lyin' over there,
Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined
For life.  No sir, I ain't going
No place.  You want to go, fine.
I'm stayin' right here and have
It out with those bastards."
741,MORGAN,741,How much you wanna bet?
742,WYATT,742,I just got it fixed.
743,MORGAN,743,You're on.
744,WYATT,744,"No, no!  Get the doctor!  Jesus Christ!"
745,DR. GOODFELLOW,745,Hold him.
746,WYATT,746,"Oh, no, get her out of her!  Jesus!"
747,DR. GOODFELLOW,747,"I said hold him, God damn it!"
748,WYATT,748,Somebody shut that dog up!
749,MORGAN,749,"You were right, Wyatt.  They got
Me good.  Don't let 'em get you
Too."
750,WYATT,750,Will somebody get the damn dog out-
751,MORGAN,751,"Remember about the light you're
Supposed to see when you're dyin'?"
752,WYATT,752,"Easy Morg, don't think about that now."
753,MORGAN,753,Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
754,WYATT,754,Morgan?  Morgan!
755,WYATT,755,"No, no, get away, get away from me..."
756,JOSEPHINE,756,Wyatt...
757,WYATT,757,"Whore!  Filthy whore!  Get away
From me!"
758,DOC,758,Can't you see why he did it?
759,CURLY BILL,759,"Naw, she's nobody.  Wyatt junked her."
760,DOC,760,"And so she walked out of our
Lives forever."
761,WYATT,761,"I want you to know it's over.
We're leaving and we're not
Coming back."
762,CURLY BILL,762,Well... 'bye.
763,RINGO,763,"Hey, you smell that?  Smells like
Something died."
764,CURLY BILL,764,"Oh, Jesus, Johnny..."
765,CURLY BILL,765,Take Frank and finish it.
766,STILLWELL,766,"That's Virgil with the women.  But
Where the hell's Wyatt?"
767,O.S. VOICE,767,"Right behind you, Stillwell."
768,WAGONMASTER,768,"Rest of us're 3 months out of
Independece but we're from
Carthage, Illinois originally."
769,WYATT,769,"Carthage, really?  I'm from Monmouth."
770,WAGONMASTER,770,"Another Illinois man!  Practical
Neighbors!  Step down, Marshal.
Have a feed."
771,WAGONMASTER,771,"Ain't got law, ain't got nothin'.
Only thing between us and the
Animals.  Always the way it goes,
Though.  Only way to down an
Illinois man's from behind, the
Dogs don't dare face 'em.  Mr.
Lincoln, Wild Bill, now your
Brothers:  Illinois men all and
All downed from behind by dirty
Dogs and Democrats.  Guess an
Ordinary man'd be out for
Vengeance but I don't figure
That'll answer here.  It's a
Reckoning you're after."
772,WYATT,772,If the Lord is my friend.
773,WAGONMASTER,773,"Let not your heart be faint, let
Your arm be steel-that's all you
Need of the Lord."
774,WYATT,774,Know why you're here?
775,VERMILLION,775,"Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want
Us to help you get Ike Clanton
And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows
They're the ones to blame for
Your brothers."
776,WYATT,776,"They're nothing.  They're nobody.
I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I
Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em
Out of the territory."
777,JOHNSON,777,"Are you out of your mind?  What on
Earth'd make us-"
778,WYATT,778,"I'll pay you 500 each in advance
And I'll mount you on those."
779,WYATT,779,"Got a sheaf of federal warrants.
Being in the Territories it's up
To our discretion how they're
Served.  That means we got the
Cowboys without quarter.  The
Black flag, brother.  No
Prisoners, no mercy, amen."
780,VERMILLION,780,"500... Year's wages.  And I never
even saw a horse like that."
781,JOHNSON,781,You crazy?  It can't be done.
782,MCMASTERS,782,"It might be done.  If we hit the
Waterholes through the southern
Dragoons, the Whetstones and
Huachucas, we could take 'em on
In pieces, run off their herds."
783,MCMASTERS,783,"Keep your money, I'll show you
Where those waterholes are.  Just
Promise me you'll finish it.  No
Matter what happens you'll see it
Through to the end.  I'll have
Your hand on that."
784,VERMILLION,784,"We come through this in one
Piece, can we keep the horses?"
785,JOHNSON,785,"Crapped out.  Okay, we're in."
786,WYATT,786,"The minute we start we'll be
Going against local and county
Law.  If we fail the U.S.
Government won't be able to lift
A finger to help us.  Nevertheless
I want you to understand we carry
The full force and authority of
The law of this land."
787,WYATT,787,"Raise your right hands.  Do you
Solemnly swear to uphold the laws
And constitution of the United
States of America and to protect
her citizens to the best of your
Ability, even at the cost of your
Own life?"
788,DOC,788,Oh... All right.
789,DOC,789,"You know why I'm here.  My
Hypocrisy only goes so far."
790,LUCINDA,790,Wait!
791,LUCINDA,791,Your colors.
792,WAGONMASTER,792,"Good luck, boys.  And give 'em hell!"
793,LUCINDA'S SON,793,"Wyatt Earp, the two-gun man,
Whistling death and bloody
Murder!  Wyatt the widow-maker,
Avenging and bright, purple
Poison on horseback with
Lightning in his eye and thunder
In his heart!  Wyatt and his he-
Devils, holy terrors and true,
Five black centaurs blowin' fire
And quicksilver!  Ride out and
Charge and shoot and strike and
Cleave and hack and thrust home!
Don't let up and give no rest and
Never call retreat till the last
One's smashed and smote and
Runnin' for cover.  Best 'em all
And break 'em up and bang their
Heads together in a bunch and
Give no quarter though they be
Ten times ten thousand!"
794,ILLINOIS MOTHER,794,What're you doing?
795,ILLINOIS FATHER,795,"Someday he'll be able to say he
Was there when Wyatt Earp rode
Out to bring the law."
796,WYATT,796,"All right, let's wring 'em out!"
797,JOHNSON,797,"Like flyin', son.  Just like flyin'."
798,PONY DEAL,798,Maybe they smell a wolf.
799,PONY DEAL,799,Go up there and take a look.
800,PONY DEAL,800,Look!
801,BARNES,801,Look out!
802,WYATT,802,United States Marshals!  Reach!
803,DOC,803,Say something witty.
804,BARNES,804,"Hey, you can't come-"
805,WYATT,805,"One more word and I'll blind you.
Get over there!"
806,PONY DEAL,806,"Hey brother, what're you doin'-"
807,MCMASTERS,807,"I ain't your brother, I ain't
None of your damn brothers.  Move!"
808,WYATT,808,"All right, run 'em off."
809,SWILLING,809,"Bastard!  Stinkin' bastard!  Like
To eat you blood raw!"
810,WYATT,810,"All right, breed.  Dig in."
811,DOC,811,"It appears he missed an excellent
Chance to keep his mouth shut."
812,WYATT,812,"Felt his liver go on that last
One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll
Be dead in a couple hours."
813,MCMASTERS,813,Florentino!  He's getting away!
814,WYATT,814,Drop his horse.
815,FLORENTINO,815,"I don't kill your brother!  I
Don't even know him.  I was only
Lookout.  It was money, they give
Me twelve dollars!  It was money!"
816,WYATT,816,A human life.  Twelve dollars.
817,FLORENTINO,817,No!
818,WYATT,818,"Look at him.  That's how you'll
All end up if you don't get it
Through your head: it's over,
The Cowboys're finished.  Forever.
So tell the others and get out of
The Territory 'cause next time I
Leave no one alive.  Understand?
No one.  You been warned."
819,WYATT,819,"All right, burn it!  Everything!"
820,WYATT,820,Leave that trash where it lays.
821,VERMILLION,821,"You know, we might just pull this off."
822,JOHNSON,822,"Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me
It gets harder from here in."
823,JOHNSON,823,Should've held out for more money.
824,WYATT,824,"I know that cut.  You mean there's
A waterhole near there?"
825,MCMASTERS,825,But this time they'll be ready.
826,WYATT,826,We'll see about that.
827,PONY DEAL,827,"Keep your eyes open for Earp's
Bunch.  Swear to God, ain't gonna
Get the drop on us this time."
828,1ST COWBOY,828,"Riders up ahead!  ...four, five.
It's them all right!"
829,DOC,829,They saw us.  Here they come.
830,WYATT,830,Wait... wait... steady...
831,WYATT,831,Now!
832,WYATT,832,Lay on!
833,PONY DEAL,833,Run!
834,WYATT,834,Come on!
835,MCMASTERS,835,What'd you do that for?
836,WYATT,836,So he can tell the story.
837,1ST COWBOY,837,"Didn't make any sense.  One minute
We're chasin' 'em, next they're
Right on top of us.  We couldn't
Stop 'em, they got everybody.
Just everybody!"
838,CURLY BILL,838,"Easy now, it's only five men.
Been havin' it their way 'cause
They been surprising you.  Hittin'
The waterholes and that Judas
McMasters is showin' 'em right
Where they are.  Pretty damn cute.
But nobody's cute as me."
839,CURLY BILL,839,"Next up's Black Draw.  But that
Smart Wyatt'll say no, that's
Where they'll expect us to hit,
We'll hit the one after.  Iron
Springs.  That's where they show
Next.  Only I'm gonna be there
First.  And throw a little party."
840,DOC,840,Don't touch me!
841,VERMILLION,841,Sorry...
842,VERMILLION,842,You really look awful.
843,DOC,843,Not half as bad as I feel.
844,VERMILLION,844,"Then why in hell're you doin'
This?  You ought to be in bed."
845,DOC,845,Wyatt Earp is my friend.
846,VERMILLION,846,"Hell, I got lot's of friends."
847,DOC,847,I don't.
848,JOHNSON,848,"Maybe you ought to have a talk
With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if
He's gonna make it."
849,WYATT,849,There's no reasoning with him.
850,MCMASTERS,850,"Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We
Could be there by mid-morning."
851,WYATT,851,"They're wise by now.  Which is
Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's
Try there, Iron Springs."
852,MCMASTERS,852,There they are.  No herd though.
853,WYATT,853,"We'll go around that way, come up on foot."
854,MCMASTERS,854,Ambush!  Get down!
855,JOHNSON,855,Christ!
856,CURLY BILL,856,"Hey, Wyatt!  How the hell are you?"
857,DOC,857,Look!
858,CURLY BILL,858,"Got some boys workin' around
Those rocks behind you.  Another
Minute or two, gonna have you in
A crossfire!  How do you like that?"
859,MCMASTERS,859,"He's right.  They get set up in
Them rocks it's the end for us."
860,CURLY BILL,860,"'Course you could give yourselves
up and we could have a party!
Then what larks!"
861,VERMILLION,861,"Ain't takin' me alive, damn it!"
862,MCMASTERS,862,Think of somethin' fast or we're cooked.
863,WYATT,863,No.
864,JOHNSON,864,What?
865,WYATT,865,No.
866,DOC,866,Wyatt!
867,WYATT,867,No...
868,CURLY BILL,868,"Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get
Some, boy!"
869,WYATT,869,No...
870,CURLY BILL,870,"Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you
Bastard..."
871,WYATT,871,No...
872,CURLY BILL,872,Die!  Son of a bitch!  Die!
873,WYATT,873,No!
874,BARNES,874,Jesus Christ!
875,WYATT,875,No!
876,DOC,876,Come on!
877,WYATT,877,No...
878,DOC,878,"Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!"
879,WYATT,879,No...
880,VERMILLION,880,"Yeah, better run, you bastards!"
881,JOHNSON,881,How is he?
882,DOC,882,I don't believe it.  He's clean!
883,VERMILLION,883,What?  But I saw 'em-
884,DOC,884,"I'm telling you, there isn't a
Mark on him."
885,DOC,885,"I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I
Literally don't care if I live or
Die.  But even I can't fight human
Instinct.  Somebody suddenly
Starts shooting at me, I duck.
But you... what on earth were
You thinking about?"
886,WYATT,886,"I don't know.  It all happened so
Fast.  If I'd had a chance to
Think about it I guess I probably
Would've been scared but... Swear
To God, Doc, I just don't know."
887,VERMILLION,887,"Hey Creek, you ever see anything
Like that before?"
888,JOHNSON,888,Never even heard of anything like it.
889,VERMILLION,889,"I just thought of somethin' I
Never thought about before."
890,VERMILLION,890,I don't want to go to hell.
891,VERMILLION,891,"Talked it over.  We decided we
Don't need the money.  Took out 13
Dollars each, though.  Federal
Posseman's fee.  That all right?"
892,WYATT,892,Sure...
893,JOHNSON,893,"One thing.  We come through this
Alive, can we keep the badges?"
894,MCMASTERS,894,Where's Wyatt?
895,DOC,895,Down at the creek.  Walking on water.
896,1ST COWBOY,896,"We hit him half a dozen times but
He just kept comin', walked right
Up to Curly Bill with that 10
Gauge and blew him up!"
897,RINGO,897,Curly Bill?  He killed Curly Bill?
898,2ND COWBOY,898,"He didn't just kill him, he
Burned him down!  Blew him in
Half!  I mean all the way in half,
Like a melon!  Then he turned
Around with that big Colt and
Killed Johnny Barnes, shot up a
Couple more 'fore we got out of
there.  But it was his face, you
should've seen his face."
899,RINGO,899,He's just a man.
900,1ST COWBOY,900,You didn't see his face
901,RINGO,901,"You see my face, don't you?"
902,RINGO,902,"Everybody get this through their
Heads.  Wyatt Earp dies.  I'm
Running the show now and I'm
Telling you, Earp dies.  His men
Too.  They all die.  Understand?
We're gonna kill 'em.  For what
They did to Curly Bill we're
Gonna ride 'em into the ground
And slaughter 'em like rabbits.
'Cause this is my time, children.
This is where I get woolly."
903,GROUNDS,903,"What d'you think?  I didn't think
Curly Bill could be killed.  I'm
Tellin' you, this whole thing's
Gone sour.  We got hands droppin'
Like flies and Ringo's flat out
Of his mind.  I mean, hell
Brother, you feel like ridin'
Against Wyatt Earp?"
904,HUNT,904,"Hell no, brother."
905,GROUNDS,905,Then brother let's you and me cut out.
906,HUNT,906,"Right with you, brother."
907,BEHAN,907,"Are you crazy?  It's front page
News all over the country.  It's
Getting out of hand, Ringo.  If
Things don't settle down soon-"
908,RINGO,908,"You heard me, Behan."
909,BEHAN,909,"Ringo, you don't understand-"
910,RINGO,910,"No, you don't understand."
911,3RD COWBOY,911,"Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt ran
Out.  Four, five others, too."
912,RINGO,912,"Who cares?  Separate the wheat
From the chaff."
913,BEHAN,913,"What're you doing here, Billy?"
914,BREAKENRIDGE,914,"Curly Bill was my friend.  I'd
Like to come with you."
915,RINGO,915,"Sure, why not?"
916,RINGO,916,"I told you it was time to get
Woolly.  Now gather 'round,
Children, gather 'round.  And
Raise your right hands."
917,MCMASTERS,917,"That's Ringo out front.  And
There's Behan.  Must be 30 of 'em.
What the hell... they're wearin'
Badges."
918,WYATT,918,"Mounts're getting jaded.  We're
Gonna have to find a place to
Rest 'em up."
919,WYATT,919,Doc...
920,DOC,920,"Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just
Don't touch me!  Come on..."
921,WYATT,921,Grab him.
922,WYATT,922,"Horse're pretty well fagged and
We got a sick man with us."
923,HOOKER,923,You can put up at my ranch if you want.
924,HOOKER,924,I'm no doctor but he looks pretty bad.
925,HUNT,925,"What's it gonna be, brother?"
926,GROUNDS,926,"I don't care.  Colorado, New
Mexico, 'long as we're out of the
Territory."
927,HUNT,927,Just what we need.  Travelin' money.
928,BEHAN,928,"Robbery.  2 men stuck 'em up and
Killed a passenger.  One of 'em
Rode a Mexican saddle, the other
Had a Mother Hubbard.  Billy
Grounds and Zwing Hunt."
929,BREAKENRIDGE,929,"Oh, no..."
930,JOSEPHINE,930,"We're headed for a booking in
Denver.  They tried to take my
Watch.  He cursed them for cowards
And they shot him.  He may've been
Vain and an actor but he was
Better than all of you.  And
Gentler and braver.  I don't
Understand any of this, I only
Know it's ugly.  You're all ugly
And he was beautiful, he tried to
Put something fine into your ugly
World and you killed him for it.
Anyway the ones who did it are
headed north.  Not that you care."
931,BEHAN,931,Where're you going?  Get back here!
932,BILLY,932,"I'm sorry, sir, but we got to
Have some law."
933,RINGO,933,Let him go.  Who cares?
934,HOOKER,934,"Had a holdup.  Came her to water
Their horses before pushin' on."
935,WYATT,935,Sorry about your friend.
936,WYATT,936,And I'm sorry about...
937,JOSEPHINE,937,I forgave you the moment you said it.
938,WYATT,938,You did.  Well... thank you.
939,JOSEPHINE,939,I have to go.
940,WYATT,940,Wait!
941,WYATT,941,Goodbye.
942,WYATT,942,Damn... Damn!
943,WYATT,943,"See how she breezed out of here.
Like she had wings.  Funny thing
But I can't really remember how
She looked.  I can remember parts
Of her clear as crystal, her
Mouth, her walk, how she shut her
Eyes when she laughed, little
Bits and pieces, but not the
Whole package.  Can't put it
Together for some reason."
944,JOHNSON,944,"Good God, you're really-"
945,WYATT,945,"Cards in spades.  I'm in love with
Every second of her life.  Hell,
I'll probably love her when I'm dust."
946,HUNT,946,"No fire tonight, son.  Too many
Riders out."
947,HUNT,947,Who's that?
948,BREAKENRIDGE,948,It's Deputy Breakenridge.
949,HUNT,949,"Sister Boy!  Thank God, we was afraid-"
950,BREAKENRIDGE,950,"You shouldn't've killed Mr.
Fabian.  You shouldn't've done
That.  It was wrong.  I'm takin'
You both in for it."
951,HUNT,951,"What?  You gotta be kiddin'.  Look,
Just go home 'fore you get hurt."
952,BREAKENRIDGE,952,"Don't want to kill you but I will
If I have to.  I'm warning you."
953,GROUNDS,953,"No, I'm warning you, Sister Boy!"
954,BREAKENRIDGE,954,Don't try it!
955,GROUNDS,955,"Sister Boy, just go to hell!"
956,BREAKENRIDGE,956,Sorry.
957,HOOKER,957,"...brought 'em in draped over
their saddles.  Little Billy
Breakenridge.  Sister Boy.  He done
It.  So I guess the law's finally
Arrived in southeast Arizona."
958,RINGO,958,"Hooker's got around 15 or 16
Hands.  We could take 'em right
Enough but it might be a mess.
Keep the place bottled up for
Now, see if we can figure a way
To flush 'em."
959,BEHAN,959,"It's too much!  It's completely
Out of hand!  Governor Gosper's
Talking about asking the
President to send in the Army!
Listen Ringo, you've got to get
This over with and you've got to
Do it now.  One way or another."
960,WYATT,960,We should get moving.
961,VERMILLION,961,Doc's just in no kinda shape.
962,HOOKER,962,"Don't have to bother about that.
Took a vote.  Cowboys or not, you
Can stay here as long as you want.
Anyway maybe you done enough.  I
Mean you whittled 'em down
Considerable, now there's talk of
Sendin' the Army in here.  Ask me,
You done enough."
963,RANCH HAND,963,Rider comin' in under a white flag
964,3RD COWBOY,964,"Got a message.  Ringo wants
McMaster to come over to our
Camp for a parley."
965,MCMASTERS,965,"He didn't figure on all the stink
This is causin'.  Might be he's
lookin' to strike a bargain.  If
So, he probably figures he needs
Somebody like me who talks his
Language.  Could be we got him."
966,WYATT,966,I don't like it.
967,MCMASTERS,967,"Might as well hear him out.
Anyways, what choice we got?"
968,MCMASTERS,968,"But no matter what happens, see
It through to the end.  If you
don't I'll curse the day I ever
laid eyes on you."
969,RINGO,969,"Well hello, Sherm."
970,MCMASTERS,970,You wanted to talk?
971,RINGO,971,"Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if
you'd join back up with us."
972,MCMASTERS,972,That what you got me up here for?
973,RINGO,973,"You're a Cowboy, you're a
Brother.  Come back, no hard
Feelings."
974,MCMASTERS,974,"Forget it, Ringo."
975,RINGO,975,"Isn't there anything I can say
That'll change your mind?  You're
Gonna stay with your new friends?"
976,MCMASTERS,976,'Least they don't scare women.
977,RINGO,977,"You're the boss.  One thing, though."
978,RINGO,978,How you gonna get back to 'em?
979,VERMILLION,979,Why couldn't they've jus killed him?
980,3RD COWBOY,980,"Ringo wanted to be sure he got
Your attention, Marshal.  He wants
A straight-up fight, just you and
Him, settle this thing once and
For all.  You win, we quit the
Territory; Ringo wins, your
Deputies get safe conduct to the
Colorado line.  Sundown today in
The oak grove at the mouth of
Sulphur Springs Canyon.  Ride out
With your escort, we'll meet you."
981,WYATT,981,"You tell Ringo... just tell him
I'll be there."
982,JOHNSON,982,"Wyatt, are you crazy?"
983,WYATT,983,I made a promise.
984,VERMILLION,984,"Wyatt, listen, you can't beat
Him.  You're good and God knows
You got the courage, but you
Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell,
He's the best that's ever been.
'Cept maybe for Wild Bill."
985,JOHNSON,985,"He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could
Put five into you before you
Could even get one into him."
986,WYATT,986,"But I'd do it, I'd get that one
Into him.  So help me God, I would."
987,JOHNSON,987,"All right Wyatt, maybe you can.
But you gotta die to do it.
Understand?  You gotta die!"
988,WYATT,988,"What makes a man like Ringo, Doc?
What makes him do the things he does?"
989,DOC,989,"A man like Ringo's got a great
Empty hole right through the
Middle of him and no matter what
He does he can't ever fill it.  He
Can't kill enough or steal enough
Or inflict enough pain to ever
Fill it.  And it drives him mad.
Sick mad.  Cold and dirty."
990,WYATT,990,So what does he want?
991,DOC,991,What does he want?  He wants revenge.
992,WYATT,992,Revenge?  For what?
993,DOC,993,Being born.
994,WYATT,994,"Remember how I said it all
Happened so fast with Curly Bill
I didn't have time to think about it?
Well I've had plenty of time
To think about this.  I spent most
Of my life since I was born not
Knowing what I want out of life,
Just chasin' my tail.  But now,
For the first time I know exactly
What I want.  And who.  And that's
The damnable misery of it."
995,WYATT,995,"I can't beat him, can I?"
996,DOC,996,"No, wait, I'll go with you..."
997,DOC,997,"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God,
I'm so sorry."
998,WYATT,998,"That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry."
999,DOC,999,Never got to wear one of those.
1000,HOOKER,1000,"Don't worry.  They want him
They'll have to go over us first."
1001,RINGO,1001,"Only three.  They left somebody
Behind.  Let's go take a look."
1002,HOOKER,1002,What're you doin' here?
1003,RINGO,1003,Who's in there?
1004,HOOKER,1004,"It's Holliday.  He's sick.  Imagine
He's dyin'."
1005,RINGO,1005,"Drag him out here, let's have a look."
1006,HOOKER,1006,"I looked the other way when you
Did a lot of foul things but I
Ain't lettin' you torment a dyin'
Man.  Not as long as he's under my
Roof.  I draw the line there."
1007,RINGO,1007,"All right, Hooker.  I'll be back
In about an hour.  We'll see how
Brave you are then."
1008,HOOKER,1008,I'll be here.
1009,RINGO,1009,"Soon as I'm through with Wyatt,
Swarm down with the whole bunch
And finish off Creek Johnson and
Texas Jack."
1010,3RD COWBOY,1010,"He's waitin' for you by the big
Oak, quarter mile up that trail."
1011,IKE,1011,"Get ready.  Soon as Ringo's done
We're gonna take care of the others."
1012,BEHAN,1012,Aren't we giving them safe conduct?
1013,IKE,1013,Sure we are.  All the way to hell.
1014,WYATT,1014,"They're not givin' you any safe
Conduct.  Soon as the shooting
Starts kick east for the New
Mexico line.  Well..."
1015,JOHNSON,1015,"Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words."
1016,WYATT,1016,I know.  Me neither.
1017,WYATT,1017,"Dear God, this is the last
Battle.  I worked it out in my
Head every which way and I know
There's no way I'm comin' through
This alive.  You've preserved me
This far so I only ask one more
Favor: just let me live long
Enough to kill that man.  Thy will
Be done and there's an amen to it."
1018,RINGO,1018,"Well, didn't think you had it in you."
1019,RINGO,1019,Shall we?
1020,DARK SILHOUETTE,1020,I'm your huckleberry.
1021,DOC,1021,"Why Johnny Ringo, you look like
Somebody just walked over your grave."
1022,DOC,1022,"Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I
Made out."
1023,RINGO,1023,"My fight's not with you, Holliday."
1024,DOC,1024,"I beg to differ.  We started a
Fight we never got to finish.
Play for blood, remember?"
1025,RINGO,1025,I was kidding about that.
1026,DOC,1026,I wasn't.
1027,DOC,1027,And this time it's legal.
1028,RINGO,1028,"All right, lunger.  Let's do it."
1029,DOC,1029,Say when.
1030,DOC,1030,Come on!  Come on!
1031,DOC,1031,"Oh Johnny.  You're no daisy, no
Daisy at all."
1032,WYATT,1032,What happened?
1033,DOC,1033,"Poor soul, he was so high-strung.
Afraid the strain was more than
He could bear."
1034,DOC,1034,Let's go!  My horse is over here.
1035,VERMILLION,1035,Praise Jesus!
1036,JOHNSON,1036,"I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too."
1037,IKE,1037,"All right, get ready..."
1038,WYATT,1038,"All right, what's it to be?  New
Mexico's that way."
1039,JOHNSON,1039,Colorado's closer
1040,WYATT,1040,"So're the Cowboys.  They're up
That road right now, waiting to
Jump us."
1041,VERMILLION,1041,"We're the law, ain't we?  Well the
Law don't ride around vermin-"
1042,JOHNSON,1042,"It rides right at 'em.  Like
McMasters said, see it through to
The end."
1043,DOC,1043,"I just wanted to see what it felt
Like.  Here..."
1044,4TH COWBOY,1044,Riders comin'.
1045,BEHAN,1045,Well I guess Ringo did it.
1046,3RD COWBOY,1046,Ringo's dead
1047,BEHAN,1047,What?
1048,4TH COWBOY,1048,That's Wyatt Earp's bunch!
1049,3RD COWBOY,1049,They're comin' right at us!
1050,4TH COWBOY,1050,Here they come!  Get ready...
1051,BEHAN,1051,"Oh, no..."
1052,4TH COWBOY,1052,What d'you think?
1053,3RD COWBOY,1053,"I think it's time to start
Workin' for a livin'."
1054,BEHAN,1054,Me too!
1055,IKE,1055,"Kill 'em!  Kill 'em!  It's only
Four men!  Why don't you kill 'em?"
1056,4TH COWBOY,1056,Why don't you?
1057,DOC,1057,"Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want
You to meet Father Feeney.  Father
Feeney's just been initiating me
Into the mysteries of the great
And ancient Church of Rome.  You
See, it appears my hypocrisy
Knows no bounds."
1058,WYATT,1058,"How you feelin', Doc?"
1059,DOC,1059,"Rather an obvious question under
The circumstances, don't you
Agree?  A better one might be how
Do you feel?"
1060,WYATT,1060,Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
1061,DOC,1061,"I imagine it would, yes.  So now
We can add self-pity to your list
Of frailties."
1062,WYATT,1062,"All right, Doc..."
1063,DOC,1063,"You think I'm kidding.  You're the
Most fallible, wrong-headed, self-
Deluding, just generally
Benighted jackass I've ever
Known.  Yet, withal, even at your
Worst, you're the only human
Being in my entire life who ever
Gave me hope."
1064,WYATT,1064,"All I ever wanted was to live a
Normal life."
1065,DOC,1065,"When will you wake up?  You
Wouldn't know a normal life if it
Bit you in the ass."
1066,WYATT,1066,That's great coming from you.
1067,DOC,1067,"I played the cards I was dealt,
Wyatt.  Your problem is you're
Always trying to play someone
Else's.  Allow me to tell you the
Truth and thus set you free:
There is no happiness, Wyatt
There is no normal life.  There's
Only life, that's all.  Just life.
The rest is relative."
1068,WYATT,1068,Then what do I do?
1069,DOC,1069,"First you can grab that black-
Haired woman and make her your own."
1070,WYATT,1070,All right.  Then what?
1071,DOC,1071,"Run.  Take that girl and start
Running.  Run and don't look back.
All your life you been running
And looking back and just barely
Existing and calling it getting
By.  This time run and don't look
Back and call it living.  Live
Every second, live it right up to
The hilt.  Live, Wyatt..."
1072,DOC,1072,Live for me.
1073,DOC,1073,"Wyatt, please, if you were ever
My friend, if you ever had even
The smallest feeling for me,
Leave.  Leave now.  Please."
1074,DOC,1074,"Never mind, Wyatt.  I know.  Just go."
1075,DOC,1075,"Now let's see, Father.  What was
That monkey show you were talking about?"
1076,FATHER FEENEY,1076,You mean Extreme Unction?
1077,DOC,1077,That's it.  Better start that ball rolling.
1078,DOC,1078,I'll be damned...
1079,DOC,1079,This is funny.
1080,1ST ACTRESS,1080,"I can't get used to this thin air
Here in Denver.  I thought I was
Going to faint on that last buck-
And-wing."
1081,JOSEPHINE,1081,"I know, it's-"
1082,JOSEPHINE,1082,Wyatt!  My God...
1083,WYATT,1083,"Did you ever see the sun come up
Over the Rockies?  It hits all of
A sudden and below there's
California and you swear you're
Looking at heaven."
1084,WYATT,1084,"I have nothing left.  I have
Nothing to give you.  I have no
Pride, no dignity, no money.  I
Don't even know how we'll make a
Living.  But I promise I'll love
You every second of your life."
1085,JOSEPHINE,1085,"Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich."
1086,1ST REPORTER,1086,"Mr Earp!  One minute, please!  You
And your four men have just
Accomplished in one week what it
Took the Texas Rangers four years
To do.  Please, do you have any comment?"
1087,WYATT,1087,There.  It'll come up over that ridge.
1088,1ST REPORTER,1088,"Don't you know?  That's Wyatt
Earp, the Lion of Tombstone, and
His lady fair."
1089,WYATT,1089,"Get ready, here it comes!  Here it comes!"
1090,V.O. NARRATION,1090,"""Wyatt and Josephine embarked on
a series of adventures throughout
the west, making and losing
several fortunes, always living
the high life, spending every
winter, just the two of them,
prospecting for gold in the
desert foothills of southeastern

Flush, in 47 years they never
Left each other's side."""
