0,CURLY'S VOICE,0,"Oh, no."
1,GITTES,1,"All right, enough is enough. You
can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly.
I just had 'em installed on Wednesday."
2,GITTES,2,Down the hatch.
3,CURLY,3,She's just no good.
4,GITTES,4,"What can I tell you, Kid? You're
right. When you're right, you're
right, and you're right."
5,CURLY,5,Ain't worth thinking about.
6,GITTES,6,"You're absolutely right, I wouldn't
give her another thought."
7,CURLY,7,"You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I
know it's your job, but you're okay."
8,GITTES,8,"Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake."
9,CURLY,9,"Thanks. You know something, Jake?"
10,GITTES,10,"What's that, Curly?"
11,CURLY,11,I think I'll kill her.
12,WOMAN,12,"I was hoping Mr. Gittes could see to
this personally."
13,WALSH,13,"If you'll allow us to complete our
preliminary questioning, by then
he'll be free."
14,CURLY,14,They don't kill a guy for that.
15,GITTES,15,Oh they don't?
16,CURLY,16,"Not for your wife. That's the
unwritten law."
17,GITTES,17,"I'll tell you the unwritten law, you
dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be
rich to kill somebody, anybody and
get away with it. You think you got
that kind of dough, you think you
got that kind of class?"
18,CURLY,18,...No...
19,GITTES,19,"You bet your ass you don't. You can't
even pay me off."
20,CURLY,20,"I'll pay the rest next trip. We only
caught sixty ton of skipjack around
San Benedict. We hit a chubasco,
they don't pay you for skipjack the
way they do for tuna or albacore."
21,GITTES,21,"Forget it. I only mention it to
illustrate a point..."
22,GITTES,22,I don't want your last dime.
23,GITTES,23,What kind of guy do you think I am?
24,CURLY,24,"Thanks, Mr. Gittes."
25,GITTES,25,"Call me Jake. Careful driving home,
Curly."
26,SOPHIE,26,"A Mrs. Mulwray is waiting for you,
with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy."
27,WALSH,27,"Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr.
Gittes?"
28,GITTES,28,"How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?"
29,MRS. MULWRAY,29,Mr. Gittes...
30,GITTES,30,"Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be
the problem?"
31,MRS. MULWRAY,31,"My husband, I believe, is seeing
another woman."
32,GITTES,32,"No, really?"
33,MRS. MULWRAY,33,I'm afraid so.
34,GITTES,34,I am sorry.
35,MRS. MULWRAY,35,"Can't we talk about this alone, Mr.
Gittes?"
36,GITTES,36,"I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These
men are my operatives and at some
point they're going to assist me. I
can't do everything myself."
37,MRS. MULWRAY,37,Of course not.
38,GITTES,38,"Now, what makes you certain he is
involved with someone?"
39,MRS. MULWRAY,39,A wife can tell.
40,GITTES,40,"Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your
husband?"
41,MRS. MULWRAY,41,...Yes of course.
42,GITTES,42,Then go home and forget about it.
43,MRS. MULWRAY,43,But...
44,GITTES,44,"I'm sure he loves you, too. You know
the expression, let sleeping dogs
lie? You're better off not knowing."
45,MRS. MULWRAY,45,But I have to know.
46,GITTES,46,"All right, what's your husband's
first name?"
47,MRS. MULWRAY,47,Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
48,GITTES,48,Water and Power?
49,MRS. MULWRAY,49,He's the Chief Engineer.
50,DUFFY,50,Chief Engineer?
51,GITTES,51,"This type of investigation can be
hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray.
It takes time."
52,MRS. MULWRAY,52,"Money doesn't matter to me, Mr.
Gittes."
53,GITTES,53,Very well. We'll see what we can do.
54,BAGBY,54,"Gentlemen, today you can walk out
that door, turn right, hop on a
streetcar and in twenty-five minutes
end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.
Now you can swim in it, you can fish
in it, you can sail in it but you
can't drink it, you can't water your
lawns with it, you can't irrigate an
orange grove with it.  Remember we
live next door to the ocean but we
also live on the edge of the desert.
Los Angeles is a desert community.
Beneath this building, beneath every
street there's a desert. Without
water the dust will rise up and cover
us as though we'd never existed!"
55,BAGBY (O.S.),55,"The Alto Vallejo can save us from
that, and I respectfully suggest
that eight and a half million dollars
is a fair price to pay to keep the
desert from our streets and not on
top of them."
56,COUNCILMAN,56,"Mayor Bagby... let's hear from the
departments again. I suppose we better
take Water and Power first. Mr.
Mulwray."
57,MULWRAY,57,"In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,
over five hundred lives were lost
when the Van der Lip Dam gave way
core samples have shown that beneath
this bedrock is shale similar to the
permeable shale in the Van der Lip
disaster.  It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure there."
58,MULWRAY,58,"Now you propose yet another dirt
banked terminus dam with slopes of
two and one half to one, one hundred
twelve feet high and a twelve thousand
acre water surface. Well, it won't
hold. I won't build it. It's that
simple. I am not making that kind of
mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen."
59,COUNCIL PRESIDENT,59,"What in the hell do you think you're
doing?"
60,COUNCIL PRESIDENT,60,Get those goddam things out of here!
61,FARMER,61,"Tell me where to take them! You don't
have an answer for that so quick, do
you?"
62,FARMER,62,"You steal the water from the valley,
ruin the grazing, starve my livestock
who's paying you to do that, Mr.
Mulwray, that's what I want to know!"
63,GITTES,63,"Morning, Sophie."
64,GITTES,64,Walsh here?
65,SOPHIE,65,He's in the dark room.
66,GITTES,66,Where'd he go yesterday?
67,WALSH'S VOICE,67,"Three reservoirs. Men's room of a
Richfield gas station on Flower, and
the Pig 'n Whistle."
68,GITTES,68,"Jesus Christ, this guy's really got
water on the brain."
69,WALSH'S VOICE,69,What'd you expect? That's his job.
70,GITTES,70,"Listen, we can't string this broad
out indefinitely we got to come up
with something."
71,WALSH'S VOICE,71,I think I got something.
72,GITTES,72,Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
73,WALSH'S VOICE,73,"It's on your desk. Say, you hear the
one about the guy who goes to the
North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking
for penguins?"
74,GITTES,74,He was there all night.
75,GITTES,75,So what you got?
76,GITTES,76,This?
77,WALSH,77,"They got into a terrific argument
outside the Pig 'n Whistle."
78,GITTES,78,What about?
79,WALSH,79,"I don't know. The traffic was pretty
loud. I only heard one thing  apple
core."
80,GITTES,80,Apple core?
81,WALSH,81,Yeah.
82,GITTES,82,"Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you
spent your day doing?"
83,WALSH,83,"Look, you tell me to take pictures,
I take pictures."
84,GITTES,84,"Let me explain something to you,
Walsh. This business requires a
certain finesse."
85,GITTES,85,"Yeah, Sophie?"
86,GITTES,86,"Duffy, where are you?"
87,GITTES,87,"Okay, slow down  Echo Park."
88,GITTES,88,"Jesus, water again."
89,GITTES,89,"Let's have a big smile, pal."
90,BARNEY,90,"When you get so much publicity, after
a while you must get blasé about it."
91,BARNEY,91,"Face it. You're practically a movie
star."
92,GITTES,92,Look at that.
93,BARNEY,93,Heat's murder.
94,OTHER CUSTOMER,94,Fools names and fools faces...
95,GITTES,95,"What's that, pal?"
96,OTHER CUSTOMER,96,"Nothing. You got a hell of a way to
make a living."
97,GITTES,97,Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
98,OTHER CUSTOMER,98,"Mortgage Department, First National
Bank."
99,GITTES,99,"Tell me, how many people a week do
you foreclose on?"
100,OTHER CUSTOMER,100,"We don't publish a record in the
paper, I can tell you that."
101,GITTES,101,Neither do I.
102,OTHER CUSTOMER,102,"No, you have a press agent do it."
103,GITTES,103,"Barney, who is this bimbo? He a
regular customer?"
104,BARNEY,104,"Take it easy, Jake."
105,GITTES,105,"Look, pal. I make an honest living.
People don't come to me unless they're
miserable and I help 'em out of a
bad situation. I don't kick them out
of their homes like you jerks who
work in the bank."
106,BARNEY,106,"Jake, for Christ's sake."
107,GITTES,107,"C'mon, get out of the barber chair.
We'll go outside and talk this over."
108,BARNEY,108,"Hey, c'mon, Jake. Sit down. Sit down.
You hear about the fella goes to his
friend and says, 'What'll I do, I'm
tired of screwing my wife?' and his
friend says, 'Whyn't you do what the
Chinese do?'"
109,GITTES,109,"I don't know how that got in the
paper as a matter of fact  it
surprised me it was so quick. I make
an honest living."
110,BARNEY,110,"'Course you do, Jake."
111,GITTES,111,An honest living.
112,BARNEY,112,"So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do
what the Chinese do?'"
113,GITTES,113,"Duffy, Walsh."
114,GITTES,114,"Sophie, go to the little girl's room
for a minute."
115,SOPHIE,115,"But, Mr. Gittes."
116,GITTES,116,Sophie.
117,SOPHIE,117,"Yes, Mr. Gittes."
118,GITTES,118,"So there's this fella who's tired of
screwing his wife."
119,DUFFY,119,"Jake, listen."
120,GITTES,120,"Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a
hurry and his friend says why not do
what the Chinese do? So he says what
do they do? His friend says the
Chinese they screw for a while. Just
listen a second, Duffy..."
121,GITTES,121,"...and then they stop and they read
a little Confucius and they screw
some more and they stop and they
smoke some opium and then they go
back and screw some more and they
stop again and they contemplate the
moon or something and it makes it
more exciting. So this other guy
goes home to screw his wife and after
a while he stops and gets up and
goes into the other room only he
reads Life Magazine and he goes back
and he screws some more and suddenly
says excuse me a second and he gets
up and smokes a cigarette and he
goes back and by this time his wife
is getting sore as hell. So he screws
some more and then he gets up to
look at the moon and his wife says,
'What the hell do you think you're
doing?"
122,GITTES,122,...you're screwing like a Chinaman.'
123,YOUNG WOMAN,123,Mr. Gittes?
124,GITTES,124,Yes?
125,YOUNG WOMAN,125,Do you know me?
126,GITTES,126,"Well... I think I... I would've
remembered."
127,YOUNG WOMAN,127,Have we ever met?
128,GITTES,128,"Well, no."
129,YOUNG WOMAN,129,Never?
130,GITTES,130,Never.
131,YOUNG WOMAN,131,"That's what I thought. You see, I'm
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr.
Mulwray's wife."
132,GITTES,132,Not that Mulwray?
133,EVELYN,133,"Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And
since you agree with me we've never
met, you must also agree that I
haven't hired you to do anything.
Certainly not spy on my husband. I
see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.
Well, you're going to get it."
134,GITTES,134,"Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray..."
135,GITTES,135,"...there's some misunderstanding
here. It's not going to do any good
to get tough with me."
136,EVELYN,136,"I don't get tough with anybody, Mr.
Gittes.  My lawyer does."
137,GRAY-HAIRED MAN,137,"Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes."
138,GRAY-HAIRED MAN,138,"I suppose we'll be hearing from your
attorney."
139,GITTES,139,"There's seven ashtrays in this room,
Duffy."
140,DUFFY,140,Okay.
141,GITTES,141,That's a filthy habit.
142,DUFFY,142,"I said okay, Jake."
143,GITTES,143,"Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here
saying she was Shirley Temple you'd
say okay to that, too."
144,WALSH,144,"Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's
real phone number and address."
145,GITTES,145,"All she needed for that was the phone
book!"
146,WALSH,146,"No, no. She said not to call, her
husband might answer."
147,GITTES,147,"When I find out who that phony bitch
was."
148,GITTES,148,Sophie.
149,SOPHIE,149,"Yes, Mr. Gittes."
150,GITTES,150,Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.
151,GITTES,151,And how about that snotty broad?
152,GITTES,152,"What does she think, she's perfect?
Coming in waving her lawyers and her
money at me  so goddam smug. She's
no better than anybody else in this
town."
153,GITTES,153,"Whitey, what's new, pal?... Yeah,
listen, where did you get those
photographs... Yeah, blowing a fuse
over the El Macando love nest.  That's
cute, Whitey... so who sent them to
you... I sent them?"
154,GITTES,154,"Why would I be asking how you got
them if I sent them?... Whitey?...
Whitey?... C'mon, level with me for
once, my tit's in the wringer and
it's beginning to hurt... yeah...
yeah... yeah."
155,WALSH,155,So he says you sent them?
156,GITTES,156,They're all a bunch of phonies.
157,GITTES,157,"Mr. Mulwray, please."
158,SECRETARY,158,"He's not in, Mr.?"
159,GITTES,159,Gittes.
160,SECRETARY,160,May I ask what this is regarding?
161,GITTES,161,It's personal. Has he been out long?
162,SECRETARY,162,Since lunch.
163,GITTES,163,Gee whiz.
164,GITTES,164,And I'm late.
165,SECRETARY,165,He was expecting you?
166,GITTES,166,"Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go
in and wait?"
167,YELBURTON,167,Can I help you?
168,YELBURTON,168,"Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the
Department."
169,GITTES,169,"J.J. Gittes. And it's not a
departmental matter."
170,YELBURTON,170,"I wonder if you'd care to wait in my
office?"
171,YELBURTON,171,"You see, this whole business in the
paper with Mr. Mulwray has us all on
edge."
172,YELBURTON,172,"After all, you work with a man for a
certain length of time, you come to
know him, his habits, his values,
and so forth. Well either he's the
kind who chases after women or he
isn't."
173,GITTES,173,And Mulwray isn't?
174,YELBURTON,174,He never even kids about it.
175,GITTES,175,Maybe he takes it very seriously.
176,GITTES,176,"You don't happen to know where Mr.
Mulwray's having lunch?"
177,YELBURTON,177,"I'm sorry, I --"
178,GITTES,178,"Well, tell him I'll be back."
179,GITTES,179,"Mind if I take one of your cards?
In case I want to get in touch with
you again."
180,YELBURTON,180,Help yourself.
181,GITTES,181,"Mulvihlll, what are you doing here?"
182,MULVIHILL,182,"They shut my water off, what's it to
you?"
183,GITTES,183,"How'd you find out? You don't drink
it, you don't take a bath in it,
maybe they sent you a letter. Ah,
but then you'd have to be able to
read."
184,GITTES,184,"Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you."
185,GITTES,185,Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
186,YELBURTON,186,Hope so. He's working for us.
187,GITTES,187,J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.
188,CHINESE BUTLER,188,Please.
189,CHINESE BUTLER,189,"You wait, please."
190,GARDENER,190,Bad for glass.
191,GITTES,191,Yeah sure. Bad for glass.
192,EVELYN,192,"Yes, Mr. Gittes?"
193,GITTES,193,"Actually, I'm here to see your
husband, Mrs. Mulwray."
194,EVELYN,194,Would you like something to drink?
195,GITTES,195,What are you having?
196,EVELYN,196,Iced tea.
197,GITTES,197,"Yeah. Fine, thank you."
198,EVELYN,198,My husband's at the office.
199,GITTES,199,"Actually he's not. And he's moved
from his apartment at the El Macando."
200,EVELYN,200,That's not his apartment.
201,GITTES,201,"Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs.
Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be
loved, but I am in business, and
believe me, whoever set up your
husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small
town, people talk."
202,GITTES,202,"I'm just trying to make a living,
and I don't want to become a local
Joke."
203,EVELYN,203,"Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into
it. I'll drop the lawsuit."
204,GITTES,204,What?
205,EVELYN,205,I said I'll drop it.
206,EVELYN,206,"So let's just drop the whole thing.
Sugar?  Lemon?"
207,GITTES,207,Mrs. Mulwray?
208,EVELYN,208,"Yes, Mr. Gittes?"
209,GITTES,209,I don't want to drop it.
210,GITTES,210,"I should talk this over with your
husband."
211,EVELYN,211,"Why?... What on earth for?  Look,
Hollis seems to think you're an
innocent man."
212,GITTES,212,"Well, I've been accused of many
things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that."
213,GITTES,213,"You see, somebody went to a lot of
trouble here, and I want to find
out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not
the one who's supposed to be caught
with my pants down... so I'd like to
see your husband. Unless that's a
problem."
214,EVELYN,214,What do you mean?
215,GITTES,215,"May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?"
216,EVELYN,216,"You may if you can, Mr. Gittes."
217,GITTES,217,"Well, that little girlfriend, she
was attractive in a cheap sort of
way of course.  She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together
somewhere."
218,EVELYN,218,"Suppose they did. How does it concern
you?"
219,GITTES,219,"Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I
just --"
220,EVELYN,220,"It's very personal. It couldn't be
more personal. Is this a business or
an obsession with you?"
221,GITTES,221,"Look at it this way. Now this phony
broad, excuse the language, says
she's you, she's hired me. Whoever
put her up to it, didn't have anything
against me. They were out to get
your husband. Now if I see him, I
can help him.  Did you talk this
morning?"
222,EVELYN,222,No. I went riding rather early.
223,GITTES,223,Looks like you went quite a distance.
224,EVELYN,224,"No, Just riding bareback, that's
all. Anyway, you might try the Oak
Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs.
Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks
around them. Otherwise he'll be home
by 6:30."
225,GITTES,225,I'll stop by.
226,EVELYN,226,Please call first.
227,GUARD,227,"Sorry, this is closed to the public,
sir."
228,GITTES,228,"It's all right. Russ Yelburton, Deputy
Chief in the Department."
229,GUARD,229,"Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down."
230,LOACH,230,"Gittes, for Chrissakes."
231,GITTES,231,Loach.
232,LOACH,232,"C'mon, get out of here before --"
233,GITTES,233,"Before what? What the hell's going
on?"
234,ESCOBAR,234,"Hello, Jake."
235,GITTES,235,"How are you, Lou?"
236,ESCOBAR,236,"I have a cold I can't seem to shake
but other than that, I'm fine."
237,GITTES,237,Summer colds are the worst.
238,ESCOBAR,238,"Yeah, they are."
239,A FIREMAN,239,"No smoking, sir. It's a fire hazard
this time of year."
240,ESCOBAR,240,"I think we can make an exception.
I'll see he's careful with the
matches."
241,GITTES,241,"Thanks, Lou."
242,ESCOBAR,242,How'd you get past the guards?
243,GITTES,243,"Well, to tell you the truth, I lied
a little."
244,ESCOBAR,244,You've done well by yourself.
245,GITTES,245,I get by.
246,ESCOBAR,246,"Well, sometimes it takes a while for
a man to find himself and I guess
you have."
247,LOACH,247,"Poking around in other people's dirty
linen."
248,GITTES,248,"Yeah. Tell me, you still throw
Chinamen into jail for spitting on
the laundry?"
249,ESCOBAR,249,"You're behind the times, Jake. They've
got steam irons now."
250,ESCOBAR,250,And I'm out of Chinatown.
251,GITTES,251,Since when?
252,ESCOBAR,252,Since I made Lieutenant.
253,GITTES,253,Congratulations.
254,ESCOBAR,254,Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
255,GITTES,255,Looking for someone.
256,ESCOBAR,256,Who?
257,GITTES,257,Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
258,ESCOBAR,258,Oh yes.
259,GITTES,259,I'd like to talk to him.
260,ESCOBAR,260,You're welcome to try. There he is.
261,ESCOBAR,261,"It looks like he was washed the entire
length of the runoff channel. Could
he swim?"
262,EVELYN,262,Of course.
263,ESCOBAR,263,"Obviously the fall must have knocked
him out."
264,ESCOBAR,264,"This alleged affair he was having.
The publicity didn't make him morose
or unhappy?"
265,EVELYN,265,"...Well, it didn't make him happy..."
266,ESCOBAR,266,"But there is no possibility he would
have taken his own life?"
267,EVELYN,267,No.
268,ESCOBAR,268,"Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know
the name of the young woman in
question?"
269,EVELYN,269,No.
270,ESCOBAR,270,Do you know where she might be?
271,EVELYN,271,Certainly not!
272,ESCOBAR,272,"You and your husband never discussed
her?"
273,EVELYN,273,"He... we did... he wouldn't tell me
her name.  We quarreled over her...
of course. It came as a complete
surprise to me."
274,ESCOBAR,274,A complete surprise?
275,EVELYN,275,Yes.
276,ESCOBAR,276,"But I thought you'd hired a private
investigator."
277,EVELYN,277,A private investigator?
278,ESCOBAR,278,Mr. Gittes.
279,EVELYN,279,Well yes.
280,EVELYN,280,"But I... I... did that because I
thought it was a nasty rumor I'd put
an end to..."
281,ESCOBAR,281,"And when did Mr. Gittes inform you
that these rumors had some foundation
in fact?"
282,GITTES,282,"Just before the story broke in the
papers, Lou."
283,ESCOBAR,283,"You wouldn't happen to know the
present whereabouts of the young
woman."
284,GITTES,284,No.
285,ESCOBAR,285,Or her name?
286,GITTES,286,No.
287,EVELYN,287,"Will you need me for anything else,
Lieutenant?"
288,ESCOBAR,288,"I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of
course you have my deepest sympathy
and if we need anymore information,
we'll be in touch."
289,GITTES,289,"I'll walk her to her car, be right
back."
290,GITTES,290,Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
291,EVELYN,291,...Just a minute...
292,GITTES,292,You left your keys in the ignition.
293,EVELYN,293,Oh... thank you.
294,EVELYN,294,"Thank you for going along with me. I
just didn't want to explain
anything... I'll send you a check."
295,GITTES,295,A check?
296,EVELYN,296,"To make it official, I hired you."
297,GITTES,297,"Don't give me that, Lou. You hauled
me down here for a statement."
298,ESCOBAR,298,I don't want it anymore.
299,GITTES,299,No?
300,ESCOBAR,300,No. It was an accident.
301,GITTES,301,"You mean that's what you're going to
call it."
302,ESCOBAR,302,That's right.
303,ESCOBAR,303,Out of respect for his civic position.
304,GITTES,304,"What'd he do, Lou, make a pass at
your sister?"
305,ESCOBAR,305,"No, he drowned a cousin of mine with
about five hundred other people. But
they weren't very important, just a
bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a
dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't
come out of this smelling like a
rose, you know."
306,GITTES,306,"Oh yeah? Can you think of something
to charge me with?"
307,ESCOBAR,307,"When I do, you'll hear about it."
308,MORTY,308,"Jake, what're you doin' here?"
309,GITTES,309,"Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour,
I thought I'd drop by and see who
died lately."
310,MORTY,310,"Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle
of a drought, the water commissioner
drowns. Only in L.A."
311,GITTES,311,Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
312,MORTY,312,That's a long fall.
313,GITTES,313,"So how are you, Morty?"
314,MORTY,314,"Never better. You know me, Jake."
315,GITTES,315,"Yeah, so who you got there?"
316,MORTY,316,"Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk used to
hang around Ferguson's Alley."
317,MORTY,317,"Quite a character. Lately he'd been
living in one of the downtown storm
drains. Had a bureau dresser down
there and everything."
318,GITTES,318,Yeah.
319,MORTY,319,"Drowned, too."
320,GITTES,320,Come again?
321,MORTY,321,"Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in
the bottom of the riverbed."
322,GITTES,322,The L.A. River?
323,MORTY,323,"Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's
wrong with that?"
324,GITTES,324,"It's bone dry, Morty."
325,MORTY,325,It's not completely dry.
326,GITTES,326,"Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a
damp riverbed either, I don't care
how soused he was. That's like
drowning in a teaspoon."
327,MORTY,327,"We got water out of him, Jake. He
drowned."
328,GITTES,328,"Jesus, this town..."
329,GITTES,329,"You were riding here the other day,
weren't you...?"
330,GITTES,330,Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
331,THE BOY,331,Si.
332,GITTES,332,"Didn't you talk to a man here... few
days ago... wore glasses... he..."
333,GITTES,333,"What did you talk about, mind my
asking?"
334,THE BOY,334,The water.
335,GITTES,335,What about the water?
336,THE BOY,336,When it comes.
337,GITTES,337,When it comes? What'd you tell him?
338,THE BOY,338,"Comes in different parts of the river.
Every night a different part."
339,GITTES,339,"Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit."
340,SMALLER MAN,340,"Hold it there, kitty cat."
341,THE SMALLER MAN,341,"You are a very nosey fellow, kitty
cat... you know what happens to nosey
fellows?"
342,SMALLER MAN,342,"Wanna guess? No? Okay, lose their
noses."
343,THE SMALLER MAN,343,"Next time you lose the whole thing,
kitty cat. I'll cut it off and feed
it to my goldfish, understand?"
344,MULVIHILL,344,"Tell him you understand, Gittes."
345,GITTES,345,I understand...
346,GITTES,346,"Yeah, Sophie."
347,SOPHIE'S VOICE,347,A Miss Sessions calling.
348,GITTES,348,Who?
349,SOPHIE'S VOICE,349,Ida Sessions.
350,GITTES,350,Don't know her. Take a number.
351,WALSH,351,"So some contractor wants to build a
dam and he makes a few payoffs. So
what?"
352,WALSH,352,"Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll
claim you were trespassing."
353,GITTES,353,"I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the
big boys that are making the payoffs."
354,DUFFY,354,Then what'll you do?
355,GITTES,355,Sue the shit out of 'em.
356,WALSH,356,Yeah?
357,GITTES,357,"Yeah. What's wrong with you guys?
Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em.
We'll make a killing."
358,GITTES,358,"We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice
a week, we'll be pissing on ice the
rest of our lives."
359,WALSH,359,"Sue people like that they're liable
to be having dinner with the Judge
who's trying the suit."
360,SOPHIE'S VOICE,360,"Miss Ida Sessions again. She says
you know her."
361,GITTES,361,Okay.
362,GITTES,362,"Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe
we've had the pleasure."
363,IDA'S VOICE,363,"Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr.
Gittes?"
364,GITTES,364,"Isn't everybody? What can I do for
you, Miss Sessions?"
365,IDA'S VOICE,365,"Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes.
I didn't come in to see you on my
own."
366,GITTES,366,When did you come in?
367,IDA'S VOICE,367,"I was the one who pretended to be
Mrs. Mulwray, remember?"
368,GITTES,368,Shut the fuck up!
369,GITTES,369,"...Yes I remember nothing, Miss
Sessions, just going over a detail
or two with my associates... you
were saying?"
370,IDA'S VOICE,370,"Well I never expected anything to
happen like what happened to Mr.
Mulwray, the point is if it ever
comes out I want somebody to know I
didn't know what would happen."
371,GITTES,371,"I understand... if you could tell me
who employed you, Miss Sessions.
That could help us both."
372,IDA'S VOICE,372,Oh no.
373,GITTES,373,"...Why don't you give me your address
and we can talk this over?"
374,IDA'S VOICE,374,"No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the
obituary column of today's Times..."
375,GITTES,375,The obituary column?
376,IDA'S VOICE,376,You'll find one of those people.
377,GITTES,377,'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
378,GITTES,378,Thanks for coming... drink?
379,EVELYN,379,"Tom Collins with lime, not lemon,
please."
380,GITTES,380,I got your check in the mall.
381,EVELYN,381,"Yes. As I said, I was very grateful."
382,GITTES,382,"Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not
good enough."
383,EVELYN,383,"Well, how much would you like?"
384,GITTES,384,"Stop it. The money's fine. It's
generous but you've shortchanged me
on the story."
385,EVELYN,385,I have?
386,GITTES,386,"I think so. Something besides your
husband's death was bothering you.
You were upset but not that upset."
387,EVELYN,387,Mr. Gittes...
388,EVELYN,388,Don't tell me how I feel.
389,GITTES,389,"Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband
dies, you drop the lawsuit like a
hot potato, and all of it quicker
than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse
me. Then you ask me to lie to the
police."
390,EVELYN,390,It wasn't much of a lie.
391,GITTES,391,If your husband was killed it was.
392,GITTES,392,"This can look like you paid me off
to withhold evidence."
393,EVELYN,393,But he wasn't killed.
394,GITTES,394,"I think you're hiding something,
Mrs. Mulwray."
395,EVELYN,395,"Well, I suppose I am... actually I
knew about the affair."
396,GITTES,396,How did you find out?
397,EVELYN,397,My husband.
398,GITTES,398,He told you?
399,GITTES,399,"And you weren't the slightest bit
upset about it?"
400,EVELYN,400,I was grateful.
401,GITTES,401,"You'll have to explain that, Mrs.
Mulwray."
402,EVELYN,402,Why?
403,GITTES,403,"Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my
metiay.  When a wife tells me she's
happy her husband is cheating on her
it runs contrary to my experience."
404,EVELYN,404,Unless what?
405,GITTES,405,She's cheating on him.
406,GITTES,406,Were you?
407,EVELYN,407,I don't like the word 'cheat.'
408,GITTES,408,Did you have affairs?
409,EVELYN,409,Mr. Gittes.
410,GITTES,410,Did he know?
411,EVELYN,411,"Well I wouldn't run home and tell
him whenever I went to bed with
someone, if that's what you mean."
412,EVELYN,412,"Is there anything else you want to
know?"
413,GITTES,413,"Where you were when your husband
died."
414,EVELYN,414,I can't tell you.
415,GITTES,415,"You mean you don't know where you
were?"
416,EVELYN,416,I mean I can't tell you.
417,GITTES,417,"You were seeing someone, too."
418,GITTES,418,For very long?
419,EVELYN,419,"I don't see anyone for very long,
Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me.
Now I think you know all you need to
about me. I didn't want publicity. I
didn't want to go into any of this,
then or now. Is this all?"
420,GITTES,420,"Oh, by the way. What's the 'C' stand
for?"
421,EVELYN,421,K... Cross.
422,GITTES,422,That your maiden name?
423,EVELYN,423,Yes... why?
424,GITTES,424,No reason.
425,EVELYN,425,"You must've had a reason to ask me
that."
426,GITTES,426,No. I'm just a snoop.
427,EVELYN,427,"You seem to have had a reason for
every other question."
428,GITTES,428,"No, not for that one."
429,EVELYN,429,I don't believe you.
430,GITTES,430,"Do me a favor. Sit still and act
like I'm charming."
431,GITTES,431,"There's somebody here. Say something.
Anything. Something like we're being
intimate."
432,EVELYN,432,How did it happen?
433,GITTES,433,"Been meaning to talk to you about
that."
434,EVELYN,434,"Maybe putting your nose in other
people's business?"
435,GITTES,435,"More like other people putting their
business in my nose."
436,WOMAN'S VOICE,436,You son of a bitch.
437,GITTES,437,Mrs. Match. How're you?
438,MRS. MATCH,438,"Don't give me that, you son of a
bitch."
439,GITTES,439,Okay.
440,EVELYN,440,Another satisfied client?
441,GITTES,441,Another satisfied client's wife.
442,MRS. MATCH,442,"Look at me, you son of a bitch. You...
you bastard. Are you happy, are you
happy now?"
443,MRS. MATCH,443,"You smug son of a bitch. My husband's
so upset he sweats all night! How do
you think that makes me feel?"
444,GITTES,444,Sweaty?
445,GITTES,445,"Let's get out of here before she
picks up her purse."
446,EVELYN,446,"Tough guy, huh?"
447,EVELYN,447,"Oh, no. I've got my own car. The
creamcolored Packard."
448,GITTES,448,"Wait a minute, sonny."
449,GITTES,449,I think you better come with me.
450,EVELYN,450,"What for? There's nothing more to
say."
451,EVELYN,451,"Get my car, please."
452,GITTES,452,"Okay, go home. But in case you're
interested your husband was murdered.
Somebody's dumping tons of water out
of the city reservoirs when we're
supposedly in the middle of a drought,
he found out, and he was killed.
There's a waterlogged drunk in the
morgue. Involuntary manslaughter if
anybody wants to take the trouble
which they don't. It looks like half
the city is trying to cover it all
up, which is fine with me. But, Mrs.
Mulwray."
453,GITTES,453,"I goddam near lost my nose! And I
like it. I like breathing through
it. And I still think you're hiding
something."
454,EVELYN,454,Mr. Gittes.
455,GITTES,455,J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.
456,SECRETARY,456,"Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some
time."
457,GITTES,457,Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
458,SECRETARY,458,"He's liable to be tied up
indefinitely."
459,GITTES,459,"I take a long lunch. All day
sometimes."
460,GITTES,460,"Julian Cross worked for the water
department?"
461,SECRETARY,461,Yes. No.
462,GITTES,462,He did or he didn't?
463,SECRETARY,463,He owned it.
464,GITTES,464,He owned the water department?
465,SECRETARY,465,Yes.
466,GITTES,466,"He owned the entire water supply for
the city?"
467,SECRETARY,467,Yes.
468,GITTES,468,How did they get it away from him?
469,SECRETARY,469,"Mr. Mulwray felt the public should
own the display. The water. If you'll
just read the display."
470,GITTES,470,"Mulwray? I thought you said Cross
owned the department."
471,SECRETARY,471,Along with Mr. Mulwray.
472,GITTES,472,They were partners.
473,SECRETARY,473,"Yes. Yes, they were partners."
474,SECRETARY,474,Mr. Yelburton will see you now.
475,YELBURTON,475,"Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.
These staff meetings, they just go
on and on."
476,GITTES,476,"Yeah, must be especially tough to
take over under these circumstances."
477,YELBURTON,477,"Oh yes. Hollis was the best department
head the city's ever had. My goodness,
what happened to your nose?"
478,GITTES,478,I cut myself shaving.
479,YELBURTON,479,"You ought to be more careful. That
must really smart."
480,GITTES,480,Only when I breathe.
481,YELBURTON,481,"Only when you breathe... don't tell
me you're still working for Mrs.
Mulwray?"
482,GITTES,482,I never was.
483,YELBURTON,483,I don't understand.
484,GITTES,484,"Neither do I, actually. But you hired
me or you hired that chippie to hire
me."
485,YELBURTON,485,"Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit
of sense."
486,GITTES,486,"Well, look at it this way, Mr.
Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to
build a dam and he had a reputation
that was hard to get around, so.
you decided to ruin it. Then he found
out that you were dumping water every
night. Then he was drowned."
487,YELBURTON,487,"Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous
accusation.  I don't know what you're
talking about."
488,GITTES,488,"Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the
Times will. Dumping thousands of
gallons of water down the toilet in
the middle of a drought.  That's
news."
489,YELBURTON,489,"Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes.
We're... well, we're not anxious for
this to get around, but we have been
diverting a little water to irrigate
avocado and walnut groves in the
northwest valley. As you know, the
farmers there have no legal right to
our water, and since the drought
we've had to cut them off. The city
comes first, naturally.  But, well,
we've been trying to help some of
them out, keep them from going under.
Naturally when you divert water you
get a little runoff."
490,GITTES,490,"Yeah, a little runoff. Where are
those orchards?"
491,YELBURTON,491,"I said, the northwest valley."
492,GITTES,492,That's like saying they're in Arizona.
493,YELBURTON,493,"Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and
I can't give you an exact location..."
494,GITTES,494,"You're a married man, am I right?"
495,YELBURTON,495,Yes...
496,GITTES,496,"Hard working, have a wife and kids..."
497,YELBURTON,497,Yes...
498,GITTES,498,"I don't want to nail you. I just
want to know who put you up to it.
I'll give you a few days to think it
over."
499,GITTES,499,"Call me. I can help. Who knows?
Maybe we can lay the whole thing off
on a few big shots and you can stay
head of the department for the next
twenty years."
500,EVELYN,500,What's your usual salary?
501,GITTES,501,"Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty
for each of my operators, plus
expenses, plus my fee if I show
results."
502,EVELYN,502,"Whoever's behind my husband's death,
why have they gone to all this
trouble?"
503,GITTES,503,"Money. How they plan to make it by
emptying the reservoirs, that I don't
know."
504,EVELYN,504,"I'll pay your salary plus five
thousand dollars if you find out
what happened to Hollis and who is
involved."
505,GITTES,505,"Sophie, draw up one of our standard
forms for Mrs. Mulwray."
506,GITTES,506,"Tell me, did you get married before
or after Mulwray and your father
sold the water department?"
507,GITTES,507,"Your father is Julian Cross, isn't
he?"
508,EVELYN,508,"Yes, of course. It was quite a while
after. I was just out of grade school
when they did that."
509,GITTES,509,"So you married your father's business
partner?"
510,GITTES,510,"You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray."
511,EVELYN,511,Oh.
512,GITTES,512,"Is there something upsetting about
my asking about your father?"
513,EVELYN,513,"No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis
and my fa... my father had a falling
out..."
514,GITTES,514,"Over the water department, or over
you?"
515,EVELYN,515,"Not over me. Why would they have a
falling out over me?"
516,GITTES,516,Then it was over the water department.
517,EVELYN,517,"Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes
and no.  Hollis felt the public should
own the water but I don't think my
father felt that way.  Actually, it
was over the Van der Lip. The dam
that broke."
518,GITTES,518,"Oh, yeah?"
519,EVELYN,519,Yes. He never forgave him for it.
520,GITTES,520,Never forgave him for what?
521,EVELYN,521,"For talking him into building it, he
never forgave my father... They
haven't spoken to this day."
522,GITTES,522,You sure shout that?
523,EVELYN,523,Of course I'm sure.
524,GITTES,524,"What about you? Do you and your father
get along?"
525,GITTES,525,"Sign here... The other copy's for
you."
526,EVELYN,526,What are you thinking?
527,GITTES,527,"Before this I turned on the faucet,
it came out hot and cold, I didn't
think there was a thing to it."
528,GITTES,528,What?
529,OLD MAN,529,You'll have to sit with the pilot.
530,PILOT,530,"Well, you're not going fishing."
531,GITTES,531,Not exactly.
532,PILOT,532,But that's what you told your wife.
533,PILOT,533,"Lots of fellas do. Tell the little
woman they're going on a fishing
trip, then shack up with some little
twist on the island... she pretty?"
534,GITTES,534,"I'm going to see a man called Julian
Cross. Ever heard of him?"
535,PILOT,535,"Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you,
mister?... I ask because he doesn't
see a whole lot of people."
536,GITTES,536,I'm working for his daughter.
537,PILOT,537,"That right?... She used to be some
looker."
538,GITTES,538,"She ain't exactly long in the tooth
now."
539,PILOT,539,"She must be about thirty-three, thirty-
four."
540,GITTES,540,"You must be thinking of a different
daughter."
541,PILOT,541,"No, he's only got one, I remember
her age, I read it in the newspapers
when she ran away."
542,GITTES,542,She ran away?
543,PILOT,543,"Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the
time. Julian Cross' daughter. God
almighty. She was a wild little thing."
544,PILOT,544,"Course, she settled down nicely."
545,GITTES,545,"Well, you never know, do you?"
546,PILOT,546,That's for sure.
547,GITTES,547,Why'd she run away?
548,PILOT,548,"Oh, you know. She was sixteen or
seventeen."
549,GITTES,549,"We missed the best of it, didn't we,
pal?"
550,PILOT,550,"She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she
was knocked up and didn't even know
who the father was. Went there to
get rid of it."
551,GITTES,551,You don't say?
552,PILOT,552,"Cross was looking for her all over
the country. Offered rewards,
everything. Felt real sorry for him,
with all his money."
553,CROSS,553,Horseshit.
554,GITTES,554,Sir?
555,CROSS,555,I said horseshit.
556,CROSS,556,Horseshit.
557,GITTES,557,"Yes, sir, that's what it looks like.
I'll give you that."
558,CROSS,558,"Love the smell of it. A lot of people
do but of course they won't admit
it. Look at the shape."
559,CROSS,559,Always the same.
560,GITTES,560,Always?
561,CROSS,561,"What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the
animal's sick or something."
562,CROSS,562,"And the steam rising off it like
that in the morning. That's life,
Mr. Gittes. Life."
563,CROSS,563,"Perhaps this preoccupation with
horseshit may seem a little perverse,
but I ask you to remember this. One
way or another, it's what I've dealt
in all my life. Let's have breakfast."
564,CROSS,564,"You know, you've got a nasty
reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that."
565,GITTES,565,Thanks.
566,CROSS,566,"If you were a bank president that
would be one thing, but in your
business it's admirable. And it's
good advertising."
567,GITTES,567,It doesn't hurt.
568,CROSS,568,"It's why you attract a client like
my daughter."
569,GITTES,569,Probably.
570,CROSS,570,"But I'm surprised you're still working
for her, unless she's suddenly come
up with another husband."
571,GITTES,571,"No. She happens to think the last
one was murdered."
572,CROSS,572,How did she get that idea?
573,GITTES,573,I think I gave it to her.
574,CROSS,574,"Uh-huh. Oh I hope you don't mind. I
believe they should be served with
the head."
575,GITTES,575,"Fine, as long as you don't serve
chicken that way."
576,CROSS,576,Tell me. What do the police say?
577,GITTES,577,They're calling it an accident.
578,CROSS,578,Who's the investigating officer?
579,GITTES,579,Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
580,CROSS,580,Do you know him?
581,GITTES,581,Oh yes.
582,CROSS,582,Where from?
583,GITTES,583,We worked in Chinatown together.
584,CROSS,584,Would you call him a capable man?
585,GITTES,585,Very.
586,CROSS,586,Honest?
587,GITTES,587,"Far as it goes. Of course he has to
swim in the same water we all do."
588,CROSS,588,"Of course, but you've got no reason
to think he's bungled the case?"
589,GITTES,589,None.
590,CROSS,590,That's too bad.
591,GITTES,591,Too bad?
592,CROSS,592,"It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes
me think you're taking my daughter
for a ride. Financially speaking, of
course. How much are you charging
her?"
593,GITTES,593,"My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come
up with any results."
594,CROSS,594,"Are you sleeping with her? Come,
come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to
think about that to remember, do
you?"
595,GITTES,595,"If you want an answer to that question
I can always put one of my men on
the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross."
596,CROSS,596,"Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a
disturbed woman who's lost her
husband. I don't want her taken
advantage of. Sit down."
597,GITTES,597,What for?
598,CROSS,598,"You may think you know what you're
dealing with, but believe me, you
don't."
599,CROSS,599,Why is that funny?
600,GITTES,600,"It's what the D.A. used to tell me
about Chinatown."
601,CROSS,601,Was he right?
602,CROSS,602,"...Exactly what do you know about
me, Mr. Gittes?"
603,GITTES,603,"Mainly that you're rich and too
respectable to want your name in the
papers."
604,CROSS,604,"'Course I'm respectable. I'm old.
Politicians, ugly buildings and whores
all get respectable if they last
long enough. I'll double whatever
your fees are and I'll pay you ten
thousand dollars if you can find
Hollis' girlfriend."
605,GITTES,605,His girlfriend?
606,CROSS,606,"Yes, his girlfriend."
607,GITTES,607,"You mean the little chippie he was
with at the El Macando?"
608,CROSS,608,"Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?"
609,GITTES,609,Yeah.
610,CROSS,610,Doesn't that strike you as odd?
611,GITTES,611,No. She's probably scared to death.
612,CROSS,612,"Wouldn't it be useful to talk to
her?"
613,GITTES,613,Maybe.
614,CROSS,614,"If Mulwray was murdered, she was
probably one of the last people to
see him."
615,GITTES,615,"You didn't see Mulwray much, did
you?"
616,CROSS,616,No.
617,GITTES,617,When was the last time?
618,CROSS,618,"Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of
damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to
the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em
practice up out here."
619,GITTES,619,"Yeah. Do you remember the last time
you talked to Mulwray?"
620,CROSS,620,"At my age, you tend to lose track..."
621,GITTES,621,"Well, It was about five days ago.
You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle
and you had one hell of an argument."
622,GITTES,622,"I've got the photographs in my office.
If they'll help you remember. What
was the argument about?"
623,CROSS,623,My daughter.
624,GITTES,624,What about her?
625,CROSS,625,"Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I
think she is frightened and I happen
to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd
like to help her if I can."
626,GITTES,626,"I didn't realize you and Hollis were
so fond of each other."
627,CROSS,627,"Hollis Mulwray made this city and he
made me a fortune... We were a lot
closer than Evelyn realized."
628,GITTES,628,"If you want to hire me, I still have
to know what you and Mulwray were
arguing about."
629,CROSS,629,"Well... she's an extremely jealous
person. I didn't want her to find
out about the girl."
630,GITTES,630,How did you find out?
631,CROSS,631,"I've still got a few teeth in my
head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends
in town."
632,GITTES,632,"Okay. My secretary'll send you a
letter of agreement. Tell me are you
worried about that girl, or what
Evelyn might do to her?"
633,CROSS,633,Just find the girl.
634,GITTES,634,"I'll look into it as soon as I check
out some avocado groves."
635,CROSS,635,Avocado groves?
636,GITTES,636,"We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross."
637,GITTES,637,"I'm a little lost. Where can I find
the plat books for the northwest
valley?"
638,CLERK,638,"Part of it's in Ventura County. We
don't have Ventura County in our
Hall of Records."
639,GITTES,639,I'll settle for L.A. County.
640,CLERK,640,"Row twenty-three, section C."
641,GITTES,641,"Hauls the huge volume back to the
Clerk's desk."
642,GITTES,642,Say... uh... sonny.
643,GITTES,643,"How come all these new names are
pasted into the plat book?"
644,CLERK,644,"Land sales out of escrow are always
recorded within the week."
645,GITTES,645,Then these are all new owners?
646,CLERK,646,That's right.
647,GITTES,647,"But that means that most of the
valley's been sold in the last few
months."
648,CLERK,648,If that's what it says.
649,GITTES,649,"Can I check one of these volumes
out?"
650,CLERK,650,"Sir, this is not a lending library,
it's the Hall of Records."
651,GITTES,651,"Well, then, how about a ruler?"
652,CLERK,652,A ruler?
653,GITTES,653,"The print's pretty fine. I forgot my
glasses. I'd like to be able to read
across."
654,GITTES,654,"Say, pal, what's he doing?"
655,CHILD,655,Making some rain.
656,GITTES,656,"Well, you're just the man I'm looking
for."
657,GITTES,657,"Some associates and I are thinking
of buying property out here. Of
course, we're worried about the
rainfall."
658,RAINMAKER,658,No problem with me on the Job.
659,GITTES,659,Yeah.
660,GITTES,660,Do you have any references?
661,RAINMAKER,661,"City of La Habra Heights filled an
800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen
inches of rain in two days."
662,GITTES,662,That's swell. But how about here?
663,GITTES,663,"Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma
Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons,
or Jasper Lamar Crabb?"
664,RAINMAKER,664,Never heard of 'em... new owners?
665,GITTES,665,Yeah.
666,RAINMAKER,666,"Lot of turnover these days. Better
tell them to get in touch with me if
they want to hang onto their land."
667,GITTES,667,"Yeah, I'll do that."
668,RED FACED FARMER,668,"All right, quit it! Quit now! Search
the man, see if he's armed."
669,RED FACED FARMER,669,"I said see if he's armed, not empty
his pockets."
670,BIG FARMER,670,He ain't armed.
671,RED FACED FARMER,671,"All right, mister. Who you with?
Water department or the real estate
office?"
672,GITTES,672,Get away from me!
673,CRIPPLED FARMER,673,Answer him!
674,GITTES,674,"Touch me with that thing again and
you'll need a pair of them."
675,BIG FARMER,675,"Whyn't you pick on somebody your own
size?"
676,RED FACED FARMER,676,"I said cut that out! Give him a chance
to say something."
677,GITTES,677,"Name's Gittes. I'm a private
investigator and I'm not with either
one."
678,RED FACED FARMER,678,Then what are you doing out here?
679,GITTES,679,"Client hired me to see... whether or
not the water department's been
irrigating your land."
680,RED FACED FARMER,680,Irrigating my land?
681,RED FACED FARMER,681,"The water department's been sending
you people to blow up my water tanks!
They threw poison down three of my
wells! I call that a funny way to
irrigate. Who'd hire you for a thing
like that?"
682,GITTES,682,Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.
683,BIG FARMER,683,"Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch
who's done it to us."
684,GITTES,684,"Mulwray's dead. You don't know what
you're talking about, you dumb Oakie."
685,RED FACED FARMER,685,"Well, that's that."
686,GITTES,686,What's going on?
687,DUBOIS,687,"You didn't look too good, so we
thought we better call your employer."
688,DUBOIS,688,"Look here, if it's all the same with
you, we'll get your car patched up.
If you'll tell me what your trousers
run you, I'll make good on them, Mr.
Gittes."
689,GITTES,689,"It's okay, Mr. Dubois."
690,"DUBOIS,",690,"It's just that they're after everybody
out here, tearing up our irrigation
ditches trying to make our land
worthless so they can pick it up for
twenty-five dollars an acre."
691,DUBOIS,691,"Anyway. Earl here is sorry, too. He
wants to give you something to take
back with you."
692,GITTES,692,"Thanks, Earl."
693,GITTES,693,Thanks for coming...
694,GITTES,694,That dam is a con job.
695,EVELYN,695,What dam?
696,GITTES,696,"The one your husband opposed. They're
conning L.A. into building it, only
the water won't go to L.A. It'll go
here."
697,EVELYN,697,The Valley?
698,GITTES,698,"Everything you can see, everything
around us. I was at the Hall of
Records today."
699,GITTES,699,That bother you?
700,EVELYN,700,No.
701,GITTES,701,"In the last three months, Robert
Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma
Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer
5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb
25,000 acres."
702,EVELYN,702,Jasper Lamar Crabb?
703,GITTES,703,Know him?
704,EVELYN,704,"No, I think I'd remember."
705,GITTES,705,"Yeah. They've been blowing these
farmers out of here and buying their
land for peanuts. Have any idea what
this land'll be worth with a steady
water supply? About thirty million
more than they paid."
706,EVELYN,706,And Hollis knew about it?
707,GITTES,707,"It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar
Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb."
708,GITTES,708,"We got it. We got it, baby."
709,EVELYN,709,What? What is it?
710,GITTES,710,"There was a memorial service at the
Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar
Crabb. He died three weeks ago."
711,EVELYN,711,Is that unusual?
712,GITTES,712,"Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000
acres. That's unusual."
713,PALMER,713,"Hello there, I'm Mr. Palmer. Can I
help you folks?"
714,GITTES,714,"Yes, I sure hope so. It's Dad."
715,GITTES,715,"I just can't handle him anymore, can
I, sweetheart?"
716,PALMER,716,Oh my goodness.
717,GITTES,717,"Nothing to do with Dad. It's me,
actually."
718,EVELYN,718,"They just don't get along very well.
Dad's a lamb with anyone else."
719,PALMER,719,"Oh, well, I don't know."
720,GITTES,720,"Naturally, I want the best for him,
money is no object."
721,PALMER,721,Perhaps if we could meet your father.
722,GITTES,722,There's just one question.
723,PALMER,723,Of course.
724,GITTES,724,"Do you accept anyone of the Jewish
persuasion?"
725,PALMER,725,I'm sorry. We don't.
726,GITTES,726,"Don't be sorry, neither does Dad.
Wanted to make sure though, didn't
we, honey?"
727,GITTES,727,"Just to be certain, I wonder if you
could show us a list of your patients?"
728,PALMER,728,"We don't reveal the names of our
guests as a matter of policy. I know
you'd appreciate that if your father
came to live with us."
729,GITTES,729,"That's exactly what we wanted to
hear."
730,PALMER,730,"Oh, good."
731,GITTES,731,"I wonder, is it too late for us to
have a look around?"
732,PALMER,732,"I don't think so. Be happy to show
you."
733,GITTES,733,"Would you mind if we took a stroll
on our own?"
734,PALMER,734,"Just, if you will, confine yourself
to the main building. It's nearly
bedtime."
735,GITTES,735,"We understand, c'mon, sweetheart."
736,GITTES,736,They're all here. Every goddam name.
737,GITTES,737,"You're looking at the owners of a
50,000 acre empire."
738,EVELYN,738,They can't be.
739,GITTES,739,They may not know it but they are.
740,GITTES,740,"Hello, girls."
741,GITTES,741,Which one of you is Emma Dill?
742,GITTES,742,Are you Emma?
743,EMMA,743,Yes.
744,GITTES,744,I've been wanting to meet you.
745,EMMA,745,Why?
746,GITTES,746,"Did you know that you're a very
wealthy woman?"
747,EMMA,747,I'm not.
748,GITTES,748,Well you own a lot of land.
749,EMMA,749,"Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my
late husband owned a good deal of
beach property in Long Beach, but we
lost it."
750,GITTES,750,That's just lovely.
751,EMMA,751,Thank you...
752,GITTES,752,Where did you get this material?
753,EMMA,753,The apple core club.
754,GITTES,754,The apple core?
755,EMMA,755,"No. The albacore. It's a fish. My
grandson's a member and they take
very nice care of us."
756,GITTES,756,How do they do that?
757,EMMA,757,"Give us things. Not just some old
flag like this, but -"
758,GITTES,758,But what?
759,PALMER'S VOICE,759,"We're a sort of unofficial charity
of theirs, Mr. Gittes. Would you
care to come this way? Someone wants
to see you."
760,GITTES,760,"See you later, Emma."
761,MULVIHILL,761,"Come on I want you to meet somebody,
Gittes."
762,GITTES,762,Can we leave the lady out of this?
763,MULVIHILL,763,"Yeah, why not?"
764,GITTES,764,"Okay, I'd like to walk her to her
car."
765,EVELYN,765,I'll stay.
766,GITTES,766,Get in the car.
767,MULVIHILL,767,I'll see she makes it.
768,GITTES,768,"What are you waiting for? Get in the
car!"
769,EVELYN,769,Get in.
770,GITTES,770,Maid's night off?
771,EVELYN,771,Why?
772,GITTES,772,"What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's
here, that's all."
773,EVELYN,773,I gave everybody the night off.
774,GITTES,774,"Easy, it's an innocent question."
775,EVELYN,775,"No question from you is innocent,
Mr. Gittes."
776,GITTES,776,"I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray.
Frankly you really saved my a... my
neck tonight."
777,EVELYN,777,"Tell me something. Does this usually
happen to you, Mr. Gittes?"
778,GITTES,778,"What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?"
779,EVELYN,779,"Well, I'm only judging on the basis
of one afternoon and an evening, but
if that's how you go about your work,
I'd say you're lucky to get through
a whole day."
780,GITTES,780,"Actually this hasn't happened to me
in some time."
781,EVELYN,781,When was the last time?
782,GITTES,782,Why?
783,EVELYN,783,Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
784,GITTES,784,It was in Chinatown.
785,EVELYN,785,What were you doing there?
786,GITTES,786,Working for the District Attorney.
787,EVELYN,787,Doing what?
788,GITTES,788,As little as possible.
789,EVELYN,789,"The District Attorney gives his men
advice like that?"
790,GITTES,790,They do in Chinatown.
791,EVELYN,791,"Bothers you to talk about it, doesn't
it?"
792,GITTES,792,"No. I wonder... could I. Do you have
any peroxide or something?"
793,EVELYN,793,Oh sure. C'mon.
794,EVELYN,794,Doctor did a nice job...
795,EVELYN,795,"Boy oh boy, you're a mess."
796,GITTES,796,Yeah.
797,EVELYN,797,"So why does it bother you to talk
about it... Chinatown..."
798,GITTES,798,"Bothers everybody who works there,
but to me... It was..."
799,EVELYN,799,Hold still. Why?
800,GITTES,800,"You can't always tell what's going
on there."
801,EVELYN,801,...No. Why was it.
802,GITTES,802,"I thought I was keeping someone from
being hurt and actually I ended up
making sure they were hurt."
803,EVELYN,803,Could you do anything about it?
804,GITTES,804,"Yeah. Make sure I don't find myself
in Chinatown anymore. Wait a second."
805,EVELYN,805,What's wrong?
806,GITTES,806,Your eye.
807,EVELYN,807,What about it?
808,GITTES,808,"There's something black in the green
part of your eye."
809,EVELYN,809,Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
810,GITTES,810,...A flaw...
811,EVELYN,811,"...Yes, sort of a birthmark..."
812,EVELYN,812,Hello...
813,EVELYN,813,"No, no, I'll come and help, just
keep watching her and don't do
anything until I get there... 'bye."
814,EVELYN,814,I have to go.
815,GITTES,815,Where?
816,EVELYN,816,Just... I have to.
817,GITTES,817,And I want to know where.
818,EVELYN,818,"Please don't be angry... believe me,
it's got nothing to do with you."
819,GITTES,819,Where are you going?
820,EVELYN,820,Please!... Trust me this much...
821,EVELYN,821,"I'll be back. Look, there is something
I should tell you. The fishing club
that old lady mentioned, the pieces
off the flag."
822,GITTES,822,The Albacore Club.
823,EVELYN,823,It has to do with my father.
824,GITTES,824,I know.
825,EVELYN,825,He owns it. You know?
826,GITTES,826,I saw him.
827,EVELYN,827,You saw my fa... father? When?
828,GITTES,828,This morning.
829,EVELYN,829,You didn't tell me.
830,GITTES,830,There hasn't been a lot of time.
831,EVELYN,831,What did he say?
832,EVELYN,832,What did he say?
833,GITTES,833,"That you were jealous, and he was
worried about what you might do."
834,EVELYN,834,Do? To who?
835,GITTES,835,"Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing.
He wanted to know where she was."
836,EVELYN,836,"I want you to listen to me. My father
is a very dangerous man. You don't
know how dangerous. You don't know
how crazy."
837,GITTES,837,Give me an example.
838,EVELYN,838,"You may think you know what's going
on, but you don't."
839,GITTES,839,"That's what your father said. You're
telling me he's in back of this whole
thing?"
840,EVELYN,840,It's possible.
841,GITTES,841,Including the death of your husband?
842,EVELYN,842,"It's possible. Please don't ask me
any more questions now. Just wait,
wait for me. I'll be back. I need
you here."
843,GITTES,843,"Okay, give me the keys."
844,EVELYN,844,You bastard.
845,GITTES,845,"It's either that or you drive to the
police yourself."
846,EVELYN,846,The police?
847,GITTES,847,"C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your
husband's girlfriend tied up in there!"
848,EVELYN,848,She's not tied up!
849,GITTES,849,"You know what I mean. You're keeping
her there against her will."
850,EVELYN,850,I am not!
851,GITTES,851,Then let's go talk to her.
852,EVELYN,852,No!
853,EVELYN,853,She's too upset.
854,GITTES,854,What about?
855,EVELYN,855,"Hollis' death. I tried to keep it
from her, I didn't want her upset
before I could make plans for her to
leave."
856,GITTES,856,You mean she just found out?
857,EVELYN,857,Yes.
858,GITTES,858,"That's not what it looks like, Mrs.
Mulwray."
859,EVELYN,859,What does it look like?
860,GITTES,860,"Like she knows about Hollis' death.
Like she knows more than you want
her to tell."
861,EVELYN,861,You're insane.
862,GITTES,862,"Just tell me the truth. I'm not the
police. I don't care what you've
done. I'm not going to hurt you, but
one way or another I'm going to know."
863,EVELYN,863,"You won't go to the police if I tell
you?"
864,GITTES,864,I will if you don't.
865,EVELYN,865,She's my sister.
866,GITTES,866,"Take it easy... If it's your sister
it's your sister... why all the
secrecy?"
867,EVELYN,867,I can't...
868,GITTES,868,"Because of Hollis? Because she was
seeing your husband? Was that it?
Jesus Christ, say something. Was
that it?"
869,EVELYN,869,"I would never ever have harmed Hollis.
I loved him more than my own family.
He was the most gentle, decent man
imaginable... and he put up with
more from me than you'll ever know...
I just wanted him to be happy..."
870,GITTES,870,I took your husband's Buick...
871,GITTES,871,I'll return it tomorrow.
872,EVELYN,872,Aren't you coming back with me?
873,GITTES,873,"Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody
about this."
874,EVELYN,874,...That's not what I meant.
875,GITTES,875,"Yeah, well... I'm very tired, Mrs.
Mulwray. Good night."
876,VOICE ON PHONE,876,Gittes?... Gittes?
877,GITTES,877,Yeah.
878,VOICE ON PHONE,878,Ida Sessions wants to see you.
879,GITTES,879,Who?
880,VOICE 0N PHONE,880,"Ida Sessions, you remember Ida."
881,GITTES,881,Yeah?... I do?
882,VOICE ON PHONE,882,Sure you do.
883,GITTES,883,"Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida
wants to see me she can call me at
my office."
884,VOICE ON PHONE,884,"684 1/2 East Tensington. Echo Park.
She begged me to call. She's waiting
for you."
885,ESCOBAR,885,"Find anything interesting, Gittes?"
886,ESCOBAR,886,What are you doing here?
887,GITTES,887,Didn't you call?
888,ESCOBAR,888,How do you happen to know her?
889,GITTES,889,I don't.
890,ESCOBAR,890,Let me show you something.
891,ESCOBAR,891,Isn't that your number?
892,GITTES,892,"Is it? I forget. I don't call myself
that often."
893,ESCOBAR,893,"Just to be on the safe side, we had
Loach here give you a ring."
894,ESCOBAR'S ASSISTANT,894,"What happened to your nose, Gittes?
Somebody slam a bedroom window on
it?"
895,GITTES,895,"Nope, your wife got excited, crossed
her legs a little too quick. You
understand, pal."
896,ESCOBAR,896,Loach.
897,ESCOBAR,897,How about these? Look familiar?
898,GITTES,898,"Yeah, I took 'em. So what?"
899,ESCOBAR,899,How did she...
900,ESCOBAR,900,...happen to have them?
901,GITTES,901,"Either you tell me or I guess 'cause
I don't have the answer."
902,ESCOBAR,902,"You really think I'm stupid, don't
you, Gittes?"
903,GITTES,903,"I don't think about it one way or
the other. But if you want, give me
a day or two, and I'll get back to
you. Now I'd like to go home."
904,ESCOBAR,904,I want the rest of the pictures.
905,GITTES,905,What pictures?
906,ESCOBAR,906,"This broad hired you, Gittes, not
Evelyn Mulwray."
907,GITTES,907,Yeah?
908,ESCOBAR,908,"Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down
Mulwray, she hired you, and that's
how you happen to know Mulwray was
murdered."
909,GITTES,909,I heard it was an accident.
910,ESCOBAR,910,"C'mon, you think you're dealing with
a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had
salt water in his goddam lungs! Now
how did he get that... in a fresh
water reservoir?"
911,ESCOBAR,911,"You were following him night and
day. You saw who killed him. You
even took pictures of it. It was
Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying
you off like a slot machine ever
since her husband died."
912,GITTES,912,You accusing me of extortion?
913,ESCOBAR,913,Absolutely.
914,GITTES,914,"I don't think I need a day or two.
You're even dumber than you think I
think you are. Not only that, I'd
never extort a nickel out of my worst
enemy, that's where I draw the line,
Escobar."
915,ESCOBAR,915,"Yeah, I once knew a whore who for
enough money would piss in a
customer's face, but she'd never
shit on his chest. That's where she
drew the line."
916,GITTES,916,"Well, I hope she wasn't too much of
a disappointment to you, Lou."
917,ESCOBAR,917,"I want those photographs, Gittes.
We're talking about accessory after
the fact, conspiracy, and extortion.
Minimum."
918,GITTES,918,"Why do you think Mulwray's body was
moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray
knocked off her husband in the ocean
and thought it would look like more
of an accident if she hauled him up
to the Oak Pass Reservoir?"
919,GITTES,919,"Mulwray was murdered and moved because
somebody didn't want his body found
in the ocean."
920,ESCOBAR,920,And why's that?
921,GITTES,921,"He found out somebody was dumping
water there. That's what they were
trying to cover up by moving him."
922,ESCOBAR,922,What are you talking about?
923,GITTES,923,C'mon I'll show you.
924,GITTES,924,"C'mon make a decision, Lou. You're
in charge."
925,GITTES,925,It's too late.
926,ESCOBAR,926,Too late for what?
927,GITTES,927,They only dump the water at night.
928,ESCOBAR,928,Reach anybody?
929,THIRD ASSISTANT,929,"Yelburton, he's the new chief."
930,ESCOBAR,930,I know who he is. Well?
931,THIRD ASSISTANT,931,He says -
932,GITTES,932,I know what he says.
933,ESCOBAR,933,Shut up.
934,ESCOBAR,934,Go on.
935,THIRD ASSISTANT,935,"Yelburton says they're irrigating in
the valley. There's always a little
runoff when they do that. And he
says is Gittes knows that, and has
been going around making irresponsible
accusations for the last week."
936,ONE OF ASSISTANTS,936,"Let's swear out a warrant for her
arrest. What are we waiting for?"
937,GITTES,937,"Because he just made lieutenant, and
he wants to hang onto his little
gold bar."
938,ESCOBAR,938,"Have your client in my office in two
hours and remember. I don't have to
let you go. I've got you for
withholding evidence right now."
939,GITTES,939,Where's Mrs. Mulwray?
940,MAID,940,No esta.
941,GITTES,941,Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace?...
942,GITTES,942,on a trip?... vacation?...
943,MAID,943,No esta in casa.
944,GITTES,944,Bad for glass.
945,GARDENER,945,"Oh yes, bad for glass."
946,GARDENER,946,Salt water velly bad for glass.
947,GITTES,947,"Can't quite believe what he's heard,"
948,GITTES,948,Salt water?
949,GARDENER,949,Velly velly bad.
950,GITTES,950,What's that... down there?
951,GITTES,951,...there.
952,CROSS' VOICE,952,Hello.
953,GITTES,953,"Have you got your checkbook handy,
Mr. Cross? I've got the girl."
954,CROSS' VOICE,954,You've got her? Where?
955,GITTES,955,"Do you remember the figures we
discussed?"
956,CROSS' VOICE,956,Of course I do. Where are you?
957,GITTES,957,"At your daughter's house. How soon
can you get here?"
958,CROSS' VOICE,958,"Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be
there as well?"
959,GITTES,959,Either that or she'll be in jail.
960,CROSS' VOICE,960,What are you talking about?
961,GITTES,961,Just bring your checkbook.
962,CHINESE SERVANT,962,You wait.
963,GITTES,963,You wait.
964,EVELYN,964,How are you? I was calling you.
965,GITTES,965,Yeah?
966,EVELYN,966,Did you get some sleep?
967,GITTES,967,Sure.
968,EVELYN,968,"Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you
something."
969,GITTES,969,Where's the girl?
970,EVELYN,970,Upstairs. Why?
971,GITTES,971,I want to see her.
972,EVELYN,972,"...she's having a bath now... why do
you want to see her?"
973,GITTES,973,Going somewhere?
974,EVELYN,974,"Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch.
Why?"
975,GITTES,975,J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
976,EVELYN,976,"What are you doing? What's wrong? I
told you we've got a 4:30."
977,GITTES,977,You're going to miss your train!
978,GITTES,978,"Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's
above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah,
soon as you can."
979,EVELYN,979,What did you do that for?
980,GITTES,980,You know any good criminal lawyers?
981,EVELYN,981,No...
982,GITTES,982,"Don't worry. I can recommend a couple.
They're expensive but you can afford
it."
983,EVELYN,983,What the hell is this all about?
984,GITTES,984,"I found these in your backyard... in
your fish pond. They belonged to
your husband, didn't they?... didn't
they?"
985,EVELYN,985,"I don't know. I mean yes, probably."
986,GITTES,986,"Yes positively. That's where he was
drowned..."
987,EVELYN,987,What are you saying?
988,GITTES,988,"There's no time for you to be shocked
by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The
coroner's report proves he was killed
in salt water. Just take my word for
it. Now I want to know how it happened
and why. I want to know before Escobar
gets here because I want to hang
onto my license."
989,EVELYN,989,"I don't know what you're talking
about. This is the most insane...
the craziest thing I ever..."
990,GITTES,990,"Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You
were jealous, you fought, he fell,
hit his head. It was an accident,
but his girl is a witness. You've
had to pay her off. You don't have
the stomach to harm her, but you've
got the money to shut her up. Yes or
no?"
991,EVELYN,991,...no...
992,GITTES,992,"Who is she? And don't give me that
crap about it being your sister. You
don't have a sister."
993,EVELYN,993,I'll tell you the truth...
994,GITTES,994,That's good. Now what's her name?
995,EVELYN,995,Katherine.
996,GITTES,996,Katherine?... Katherine who?
997,EVELYN,997,She's my daughter.
998,GITTES,998,I said the truth!
999,EVELYN,999,She's my sister.
1000,EVELYN,1000,She's my daughter.
1001,EVELYN,1001,My sister.
1002,EVELYN,1002,"My daughter, my sister."
1003,GITTES,1003,I said I want the truth.
1004,EVELYN,1004,She's my sister and my daughter!
1005,EVELYN,1005,"For God's sake, Kyo, keep her
upstairs, go back!"
1006,EVELYN,1006,"My father and I, understand, or is
it too tough for you?"
1007,EVELYN,1007,"...he had a breakdown... the dam
broke... my mother died... he became
a little boy... I was fifteen...
he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast,
what clothes to wear!... It
happened... then I ran away..."
1008,GITTES,1008,To Mexico...
1009,EVELYN,1009,"Hollis came and took... care of me...
after she was born... he said... he
took care of her... I couldn't see
her... I wanted to but I couldn't...
I just want to see her once in a
while... take care of her... that's
all...  but I don't want her to
know... I don't want her to know..."
1010,GITTES,1010,...so that's why you hate him...
1011,EVELYN,1011,"No... for turning his back on me
after it happened! He couldn't face
it..."
1012,EVELYN,1012,I hate him.
1013,GITTES,1013,"Yeah... where are you taking her
now?"
1014,EVELYN,1014,Back to Mexico.
1015,GITTES,1015,"You can't go by train. Escobar'll be
looking for you everywhere."
1016,EVELYN,1016,How about a plane?
1017,GITTES,1017,"That's worse... Just get out of here.
Walk out, leave everything."
1018,EVELYN,1018,I have to go home and get my things.
1019,GITTES,1019,I'll take care of it.
1020,EVELYN,1020,Where can we go?
1021,GITTES,1021,...where does Kyo live?
1022,EVELYN,1022,With us.
1023,GITTES,1023,On his day off. Get the exact address.
1024,EVELYN,1024,Okay...
1025,EVELYN,1025,Those didn't belong to Hollis.
1026,GITTES,1026,How do you know?
1027,EVELYN,1027,He didn't wear bifocals.
1028,EVELYN,1028,"Say hello to Mr. Gittes, sweetheart."
1029,KATHERINE,1029,Hello.
1030,GITTES,1030,"Rises a little shakily from the arm
of the sofa."
1031,GITTES,1031,Hello.
1032,EVELYN,1032,"He lives at 1712 Alameda... do you
know where that is?"
1033,GITTES,1033,Sure. It's Chinatown.
1034,GITTES,1034,"Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah,
listen, pal, Escobar's going to try
and book me in about five minutes...
relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the
office for two hours. If you don't
hear from me, you and Duffy meet me
at 1712 Alameda."
1035,WALSH'S VOICE,1035,"Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't
it?"
1036,GITTES,1036,I know where it is! Just do it.
1037,GITTES,1037,"Come on in, Lou. We're both too late."
1038,GITTES,1038,Looks like she flew the coop.
1039,ESCOBAR,1039,"I don't suppose you got any idea
Where she went?"
1040,GITTES,1040,Matter of fact I do.
1041,ESCOBAR,1041,Where?
1042,GITTES,1042,"Her maid's house. I think she knows
something's up."
1043,ESCOBAR,1043,What's the maid's address?
1044,GITTES,1044,"She lives in Pedro. I'll write it
down for you."
1045,ESCOBAR,1045,"No, Gittes, you'll show us."
1046,GITTES,1046,What for?
1047,ESCOBAR,1047,"If she's not there, you're going
downtown, and you're staying there
til she shows up."
1048,GITTES,1048,"Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can."
1049,ESCOBAR,1049,Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
1050,ESCOBAR,1050,That's it?
1051,GITTES,1051,Yeah.
1052,ESCOBAR,1052,"Well, let's go."
1053,GITTES,1053,"Do me a favor, will you, Lou?"
1054,GITTES,1054,"Let me bring her down myself... she's
not armed or nothing... she won't be
any problem... I'd just like a minute
alone with her... It would mean
something... to...  her... and to
me."
1055,ESCOBAR,1055,"You never learn, do you, Gittes?"
1056,GITTES,1056,I guess not.
1057,ESCOBAR,1057,Give you three minutes.
1058,GITTES,1058,"Gee, thanks, Lou."
1059,WOMAN,1059,Yes?...
1060,CURLY,1060,"Mr. Gittes! Come in, come in."
1061,CURLY,1061,"Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes."
1062,GITTES,1062,Call me Jake. How is everything?
1063,CURLY,1063,"Just sitting down to supper, Jake.
Care to join us?"
1064,GITTES,1064,No thanks.
1065,CURLY,1065,"How about a glass of wine? Honey,
this is..."
1066,WIFE,1066,"Yes, I know."
1067,GITTES,1067,"Thanks just the same, Curly. I could
use a glass of water, though. Come
out with me to the kitchen for a
second."
1068,CURLY,1068,Sure thing.
1069,GITTES,1069,"Curly, where's your car?"
1070,CURLY,1070,In the garage.
1071,GITTES,1071,Where's that?
1072,CURLY,1072,Off the alley.
1073,GITTES,1073,Could you drive me somewhere?
1074,CURLY,1074,"Sure, as soon as we eat."
1075,GITTES,1075,"Right now, Curly. It can't wait."
1076,CURLY,1076,I'll just tell my wife.
1077,GITTES,1077,Tell her later.
1078,GITTES' VOICE,1078,"Just drive slow for a block or two,
will you, Curly?"
1079,CURLY'S VOICE,1079,What's this all about?
1080,GITTES' VOICE,1080,Tell you in a couple of blocks.
1081,GITTES,1081,"How much do you owe me, Curly?"
1082,CURLY,1082,"Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out
tomorrow. I know you been real good
about it but my cousin Auggie's sick."
1083,GITTES,1083,"Forget it. How would you like to pay
me off by taking a couple of
passengers to Ensenada... you'd have
to leave tonight."
1084,CURLY,1084,I don't know...
1085,GITTES,1085,"I might be able to squeeze an extra
seventy-five bucks out of it for
you. Maybe an even hundred."
1086,CURLY,1086,Plus what I owe you?
1087,GITTES,1087,I'll throw that in too.
1088,CURLY,1088,"Okay, you got yourself a boat."
1089,GITTES,1089,"Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half
an hour after you get there. Then if
I don't show, take her down to the
boat."
1090,CURLY,1090,You sure this is okay?
1091,GITTES,1091,"Curly, you know how long I been in
business."
1092,CROSS,1092,There you are.
1093,CROSS,1093,"Well, you don't look any the worse
for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say...
where's the girl?..."
1094,GITTES,1094,I've got her.
1095,CROSS,1095,Is she all right?
1096,GITTES,1096,She's fine.
1097,CROSS,1097,Where is she?
1098,GITTES,1098,With her mother.
1099,CROSS,1099,...with her mother?
1100,GITTES,1100,"I'd like you to look at something,
Mr. Cross."
1101,CROSS,1101,What is it?
1102,GITTES,1102,"An obituary column... can you read
in this light?"
1103,CROSS,1103,Yes... I think I can manage...
1104,CROSS,1104,What does this mean?
1105,GITTES,1105,That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
1106,GITTES,1106,"Right here, in this pond. You drowned
him...  and you left these."
1107,GITTES,1107,"...the coroner's report showed Mulwray
had salt water in his lungs."
1108,CROSS,1108,"Hollie was always fond of tide-pools.
You know what he used to say about
them?"
1109,GITTES,1109,Haven't the faintest idea.
1110,CROSS,1110,"That's where life begins... marshes,
sloughs, tide-pools... he was
fascinated by them...  you know when
we first came out here he figured
that if you dumped water onto desert
sand it would percolate down into
the bedrock and stay there, instead
of evaporating the way it does in
most reservoirs. You'd lose only
twenty percent instead of seventy or
eighty. He made this city."
1111,GITTES,1111,"And that's what you were going to do
in the Valley?"
1112,CROSS,1112,"No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am
doing with the Valley. The bond issue
passes Tuesday. There'll be ten
million to build an aqueduct and
reservoir. I'm doing it."
1113,GITTES,1113,"There's going to be some irate
citizens when they find out they're
paying for water they're not getting."
1114,CROSS,1114,"That's all taken care of. You see,
Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the
water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to
the water."
1115,GITTES,1115,How do you do that?
1116,CROSS,1116,"Just incorporate the Valley into the
city so the water goes to L.A. after
all. It's very simple."
1117,GITTES,1117,How much are you worth?
1118,CROSS,1118,I have no idea. How much do you want?
1119,GITTES,1119,"I want to know what you're worth.
Over ten million?"
1120,CROSS,1120,"Oh, my, yes."
1121,GITTES,1121,"Then why are you doing it? How much
better can you eat? What can you buy
that you can't already afford?"
1122,CROSS,1122,"The future, Mr. Gittes. The future.
Now where's the girl?... I want the
only daughter I have left... as you
found out, Evelyn was lost to me a
long time ago."
1123,GITTES,1123,Who do you blame for that? Her?
1124,CROSS,1124,"I don't blame myself. You see, Mr.
Gittes, most people never have to
face the fact that at the right time
and right place, they're capable of
anything. Take those glasses from
him, will you, Claude?"
1125,CROSS,1125,"It's not worth it, Mr. Gittes. It's
really not worth it."
1126,CROSS,1126,"Take us to the girl. Either Evelyn
allows me to see her, or I'm not
averse to seeing Evelyn in jail. If
I have to buy the jail. Hollis and
Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen
years. It's been too long, I'm too
old."
1127,CROSS,1127,Stop the car. Stop the car!
1128,CROSS,1128,Katherine! Katherine! Wait!
1129,GITTES,1129,"No, Curly, get 'em out of here! Get
'em out of here!"
1130,EVELYN,1130,"No, don't help him. Don't do anything."
1131,EVELYN,1131,She's gone. It's no good.
1132,CROSS,1132,Where?
1133,GITTES,1133,Let me handle that.
1134,EVELYN,1134,I'm all right.
1135,GITTES,1135,"Sure, but I'd like to handle it."
1136,CROSS,1136,"You're going to have to kill me,
Evelyn. Either that or tell me where
she is."
1137,CROSS,1137,"How many years have I got?... she's
mine too."
1138,EVELYN,1138,She's never going to know that.
1139,GITTES,1139,"Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill."
1140,GITTES,1140,"Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to
bring the police department with
you."
1141,WALSH,1141,"Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all
over the place. You oughta know
better."
1142,GITTES,1142,"Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart,
will you?"
1143,GITTES,1143,"Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in
Pedro, near the Starkist cannery.
It's the Evening Star. He'll be
waiting. I'll take care of this."
1144,ESCOBAR,1144,"Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run
around like that."
1145,GITTES,1145,"Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know
what's going on. Let her go. I'll
explain it later."
1146,ESCOBAR,1146,"Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious
offense pointing that at an officer
of the law. It's a felony."
1147,GITTES,1147,Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
1148,ESCOBAR,1148,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray."
1149,GITTES,1149,"Lou, she will kill you. Let her go
for now. You don't know."
1150,ESCOBAR,1150,"Gittes, stay outta this."
1151,GITTES,1151,Now take off.
1152,ESCOBAR,1152,"I'll just have her followed. She's
not going anywhere."
1153,GITTES,1153,No!
1154,GITTES,1154,"Where is he? I'll kill him, I'll
kill the son of a bitch."
1155,GITTES,1155,"Who is he, get his name? I'll kill
him."
1156,ESCOBAR,1156,"Take it easy, take it easy, it was
an accident."
1157,GITTES,1157,An accident?
1158,GITTES,1158,"Get him away from her. He's
responsible for everything. Get him
away from her!"
1159,ESCOBAR,1159,"Jake, you're very disturbed. You're
crazy. That's her father."
1160,ESCOBAR,1160,"You wanna do your partner the biggest
favor of his life? Take him home.
Just get him the hell out of here!"
