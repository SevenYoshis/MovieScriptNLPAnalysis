0,ACE (V.O.),0,"When you love someone, you've gotta
trust them. There's no other way.
You've got to give them the key to
everything that's yours.  Otherwise,
what's the point? And, for a while...
I believed that's the kind of love I
had."
1,ACE (V.O.),1,"Before I ever ran a casino or got
myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a
hell of a handicapper, I can tell
you that. I was so good, that whenever
I bet, I could change the odds for
every bookmaker in the country. I'm
serious. I had it down so cold that
I was given paradise on earth. I was
given one of the biggest casinos in
Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers..."
2,ACE (V.O.),2,"...by the only kind of guys that can
actually get you that kind of money:
sixty-two million, seven-hundred
thousand dollars. I don't know all
the details."
3,NICKY (V.O.),3,Matter of fact...
4,NICKY (V.O.),4,"...nobody knew all the details, but
it should'a been perfect. I mean, he
had me, Nicky Santoro, his best
friend, watching his ass..."
5,NICKY (V.O.),5,"...and he had Ginger, the woman he
loved, on his arm.  But in the end..."
6,NICKY (V.O.),6,"...we fucked it all up. It should'a
been so sweet, too.  But it turned
out to be the last time that street
guys like us were ever given anything
that fuckin' valuable again."
7,ACE (V.O.),7,"At that time, Vegas was a place where
millions of suckers flew in every
year on their own nickel, and left
behind about a billion dollars. But
at night, you couldn't see the desert
that surrounds Las Vegas..."
8,ACE (V.O.),8,"But it's in the desert where lots of
the town's problems are solved."
9,NICKY (V.O.),9,"Got a lot of holes in the desert,
and a lot of problems are buried in
those holes. Except you gotta do it
right. I mean, you gotta have the
hole already dug before you show up
with a package in the trunk.
Otherwise you're talkin' about a
half-hour or forty-five minutes of
diggin'. And who knows who's gonna
be comin' along in that time? Before
you know it, you gotta dig a few
more holes. You could be there all
fuckin' night."
10,ACE (V.O.),10,"Who could resist? Anywhere else in
the country, I was a bookie, a
gambler, always lookin' over my
shoulder, hassled by cops, day and
night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam
Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate,
but running a casino. And that's
like selling dreams for cash."
11,ACE (V.O.),11,"I hired an old casino pal, Billy
Sherbert, as my manager and I went
to work."
12,SHERBERT,12,"...And this is Ronnie, who takes
care of the card room..."
13,ACE (V.O.),13,"For guys like me, Las Vegas washes
away your sins. It's a morality car
wash. It does for us what Lourdes
does for humpbacks and cripples.
And, along with making us legit..."
14,ACE (V.O.),14,"...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean,
what do you think we're doing out
here in the middle of the desert?
It's all this money. This is the end
result of all the bright lights and
the comped trips, of all the champagne
and free hotel suites, and all the
broads and all the booze. It's all
been arranged just for us to get
your money. That's the truth about
Las Vegas."
15,ACE (V.O.),15,"We're the only winners. The players
don't stand a chance. And their cash
flows from the tables to our boxes
...through the cage and into the
most sacred room in the casino ...the
place where they add up all the money
...the holy of holies ...the count
room."
16,ACE (V.O.),16,Now this place was off limits.
17,COUNTER #1,17,Verify two thousand.
18,ACE (V.O.),18,"Even I couldn't get inside, but it
was my job to keep it filled with
cash. That's for sure."
19,NICKY (V.O.),19,"They had so much fuckin' money in
there, you could build a house out
of stacks of $100 bills. And the
best part was that upstairs, the
board of directors didn't know what
the fuck was going on."
20,COUNTER #2,20,Five thousand.
21,NICKY (V.O.),21,"I mean, to them everything looked on
the up and up. Right? Wrong."
22,COUNTER #1,22,Verify five thousand.
23,NICKY (V.O.),23,The guys inside the counting room...
24,COUNT ROOM EXEC,24,Five thousand.
25,NICKY (V.O.),25,"...were all slipped in there to skim
the joint dry.  They'd do short
counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd
even take cash right out of the drop
boxes. And it was up to this guy
right here [NANCE], standin' in front
of about two million dollars, to
skim the cash off the top without
anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or
anybody."
26,COUNTER #1,26,Verify two hundred.
27,NICKY (V.O.),27,"Now, notice how in the count room
nobody ever seems to see anything.
Somehow, somebody's always lookin'
the other way. Now, look at these
guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy,
right?  They're countin' money. Who
wants to bother them? I mean, God
forbid they should make a mistake
and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're
in and you're out."
28,NICKY,28,"Past the jag-off guard who gets an
extra c-note a week just to watch
the door.  I mean, it's routine.
Business as usual: in, out, hello,
goodbye. And that's all there is to
it. Just another fat fuck walkin'
out of the casino with a suitcase.
Now, that suitcase was goin' straight
to one place: right to Kansas City
...which was as close to Las Vegas
as the Midwest bosses could go without
gettin' themselves arrested."
29,NICKY (V.O.),29,"That suitcase was all the bosses
ever wanted ...and they wanted it
every month."
30,PISCANO,30,"Hey, John, how are you? How was your
ride?"
31,NICKY (V.O.),31,Now this old Mormon fuck here...
32,NICKY (V.O.),32,"...he had to fly in with suitcases
once a month, nice and easy."
33,NANCE,33,Somethin' smells good.
34,PISCANO,34,"Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat."
35,NICKY (V.O.),35,"The bosses would come from all over
the place: Detroit, Cleveland,
Milwaukee. All over the Midwest.
And they would meet in the back of
this produce market in Kansas City.
I mean, nobody even knew."
36,NICKY (V.O.),36,"One of the guys made his mother do
all the cooking."
37,BORELLI,37,"Did you ever see that guy Jerry
Steriano?"
38,FORLANO,38,Jerry Steriano?
39,BORELLI,39,Yeah.
40,NICKY (V.O.),40,"Now, these old greaseballs might not
look it, but believe me, these are
the guys who secretly controlled Las
Vegas."
41,PISCANO'S MOTHER,41,That man's here again.
42,NICKY (V.O.),42,"Because they controlled the Teamsters'
Union, and that's where you had to
go if you wanted to borrow money to
buy a casino."
43,BORELLI (O.S.),43,"When you've finished with him, I
want him."
44,PISCANO'S MOTHER,44,"Here you are, gentlemen."
45,NICKY (V.O.),45,"And nobody got a Teamsters' loan,
unless the guys in this room knew
they were gonna get their little
suitcases."
46,NICKY (V.O.),46,"Guys like this antique here [FORLANO],
out of Detroit. Or especially guys
like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top
boss."
47,GAGGI,47,You got a round figure on it?
48,NICKY (V.O.),48,"Definitely the most important guy in
this room."
49,NANCE,49,About twenty pounds.
50,GAGGI,50,So?
51,NANCE,51,That's around seven hundred thousand.
52,GAGGI,52,"Uh-huh, good."
53,ANDY STONE,53,"I know it's a little early for Las
Vegas..."
54,STONE (O.S.),54,"...but I do want to welcome the ladies
and gentlemen of the gaming industry."
55,ACE (V.O.),55,"As far as the world was concerned
Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters'
Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy."
56,STONE,56,This is a very auspicious occasion.
57,ACE (V.O.),57,A powerful man.
58,STONE,58,"Philip, if you would rise."
59,ACE (V.O.),59,"He even played golf with the
President."
60,STONE,60,"On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension
Fund, it is my pleasure to present
to you . . ."
61,ACE (V.O.),61,"But Andy also took orders. And when
he was told to give a pension fund
loan to Philip Green..."
62,STONE,62,"...this check for $62,700,000 for
the new Tangiers."
63,GREEN,63,Thank you.
64,ACE (V.O.),64,...he did what he was told.
65,NICKY (V.O.),65,"Now here was the perfect front man.
I mean, what the fuck else could he
be?  He didn't know too much. He
didn't want to know too much,
especially that the bosses made the
Teamsters lend him the money. He
wanted to believe the Teamsters gave
him all that fuckin' money 'cause he
was smart."
66,GREEN,66,"...I say that, knowing full well
just how much competition we have in
this great city."
67,NICKY (V.O.),67,"And where they got Green from - who
the fuck knows?  All I know is that
Green was an Arizona real estate
hustler, who barely had enough gas
money to come and pick up his own
fuckin' check..."
68,NICKY (V.O.),68,"Now, all they needed was somebody
they could trust to run the casino.
And who better than Ace?  I mean, he
was already in Vegas a couple of
years and he had the fuckin' place
clocked."
69,NICKY (V.O.),69,But typical Ace...
70,NICKY (V.O.),70,"...give him a shot at runnin' a casino
and he tries to talk you out of it."
71,ACE,71,"You know, I don't know if I could do
this even if I wanted to. The Gaming
Commission would never give me a
license. I have at least two dozen
gambling and bookmaking pinches on
me."
72,STONE,72,"You don't have to have a license to
work in a casino. All you gotta do
is apply for one. The state law says
you can work in a casino while they're
processing your application. They
got a ten-year backlog."
73,ACE,73,"But what happens when they do find
out?"
74,STONE,74,"Why would they want to find out?
We're puttin' a hundred million into
this desert here. Why would they
want to lock us out?  And besides,
they'll never find out. All you gotta
do is keep changing your job title.
Like, uh, from Casino Executive to
Food and Beverage Chairman. And what
happens it, they take your
application, they put it at the bottom
of the pile. I know guys workin'
there for thirty years, don't have a
license."
75,ACE,75,"It's a tough proposition, Andy. You,
you know, if I did it, I'd have to
run it my way."
76,STONE,76,You got it.
77,ACE,77,I'm serious. No interference.
78,STONE,78,"Nobody's gonna interfere with your
running the casino. I guarantee it."
79,NICKY (V.O.),79,"And that's how that got Ace to take
over."
80,NICKY (V.O.),80,"They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling."
81,NICKY (V.O.),81,"They worked out a real cute job title
too."
82,NICKY (V.O.),82,Tangiers Public Relations Director.
83,NICKY (V.O.),83,"But the only thing he ever directed
was the casino. He made his first
bet when he was fifteen years old,
and he always made money. But he
didn't bet like you or me."
84,NICKY (V.O.),84,"You know, havin' some fun with it,
shit like that."
85,ACE,85,"Where the hell did you learn how to
deal?"
86,NICKY (V.O.),86,He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
87,ACE,87,"Place the checks properly. That's
the way you do it."
88,DEALER,88,"Yes, sir."
89,NICKY (V.O.),89,"He had to know everything, this guy."
90,NICKY (V.O.),90,"He'd find out the kind of inside
stuff nobody else knew, and that's
what he'd put his money on."
91,NICKY (V.O.),91,"Even back home, years ago, when we
were first hangin' out together..."
92,NICKY (V.O.),92,"...he'd know if the quarterback was
on coke."
93,ACE,93,I'll take Columbia for twenty.
94,NICKY (V.O.),94,If his girlfriend was knocked up.
95,LUCKY LARRY,95,Twenty dimes on Columbia . . .
96,NICKY (V.O.),96,"He'd get the wind velocity so he
could judge the field goals. He even
figured out the different bounce you
got off the different kinds of wood
they used on college basketball
courts, you know?"
97,NICKY (V.O.),97,"He'd be workin' on this shit day and
night. There was nothin' about a
game he was gonna bet that he didn't
know."
98,GAMBLER #1,98,Ace got down at six.
99,GAMBLER #2,99,"Charlie, hey. Rothstein got six."
100,NICKY (V.O.),100,"Season after season, the prick was
the only guaranteed winner I ever
knew. But he was so serious about it
all that I don't think he ever enjoyed
himself.  But..."
101,NICKY (V.O.),101,...that's just the way he was.
102,NICKY (V.O.),102,"But back then the bosses didn't give
a fuck about whether he enjoyed
himself of not. To them, he was a
cash register. All they had to do
was ring the bell and take the money.
Especially Remo, who was a fuckin'
degenerate gambler who always lost."
103,GAGGI,103,Ma che cazzo!
104,NICKY (V.O.),104,"I mean, unless Ace made his bet."
105,GAGGI,105,That's enough now!
106,OLD MAN CAPO,106,I can't contest the cards.
107,GAGGI,107,"Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American
slang for 'Fuck off']"
108,GAGGI,108,Johnny!
109,NICKY (V.O.),109,"Ace made more money for them on a
weekend than I could do heisting
joints for a month."
110,NICKY (V.O.),110,"Whatever Ace picked up on the street
he told Remo."
111,NICKY,111,"Hey, did you bring that thing?"
112,NICKY (V.O.),112,"You know, I mean fixed fights, doped
horses, crooked fuckin' zebras...
locked-in point spreads. He told
fuckin' Remo everything. And to tell
you the truth. I don't blame him."
113,GAGGI,113,Ace.
114,NICKY (V.O.),114,"Keepin' Remo happy with money was
the greatest insurance policy in the
world."
115,GAGGI,115,"Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you
get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever
had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd
you do it?"
116,ACE,116,"Well, that's why they paid so well."
117,GAGGI,117,You see?
118,GAGGI,118,"Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do
we got on for next week?"
119,ACE,119,"Well, it's a little too early. I'd
say Thursday would be good. I'll
know by then. Is that all right?"
120,GAGGI,120,Okay. You come by the house?
121,ACE,121,I'll come by.
122,GAGGI,122,Seven o'clock?
123,ACE,123,Seven o'clock.
124,GAGGI,124,"Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay,
Ace?"
125,GAGGI,125,"Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian-
American slang for 'Come here']"
126,NICKY,126,I'll be right out.
127,GAGGI,127,"T'aggia parla. [Italian-American
slang for 'I've got to talk to you']
Nicky... See that guy?"
128,NICKY,128,Mm.
129,GAGGI,129,"Keep a good eye on him. He's makin'
a lot of money for us. And he's gonna
continue makin' a lot of money for
us, so keep a good eye on him."
130,NICKY,130,Mm.
131,GAGGI,131,"Not like your fuckin' friends out
there, that... without brains.  Okay?"
132,NICKY,132,All right.
133,GAGGI,133,"Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian-
American slang for 'I'm counting on
you']"
134,NICKY,134,Yeah.
135,GAGGI,135,Fine.
136,NICKY,136,Want me to take this for you?
137,NICKY (V.O.),137,"So, now, on top of everything else,
I gotta make sure that nobody fucks
around with the Golden Jew."
138,JOE,138,"Chase, couple of shooters for the
ladies."
139,BARTENDER (O.S.),139,All right.
140,ACE (V.O.),140,"Yeah, we made a great pair. I made
book and Nicky made sure we always
collected. The old men loved us. And
why not? They all made money with
us."
141,NICKY,141,They payin'?
142,ACE (V.O.),142,How did Nicky collect?
143,MARINO,143,"They pay every week, like they're
supposed to."
144,ACE (V.O.),144,Don't ask.
145,NICKY,145,"Then where the fuck is the money? I
don't see the money."
146,ACE,146,"Hi, Melissa. Heidi."
147,BLONDE,147,"Hi, Sam."
148,JOE,148,Who's this guy?
149,MARINO,149,"Get the fuck out of here. It was
nine. I laid nine."
150,NICKY,150,"It was eight.  Ace... tell him the
line on the Bear's game."
151,ACE,151,Eight.
152,NICKY,152,"If he don't know, nobody knows. Told
you it was eight."
153,MARINO,153,"Well, how come I laid nine?"
154,NICKY,154,"'Cause you're a jag-off. I would
have fuckin' made you lay ten..."
155,ACE,155,Excuse me.
156,JOE,156,What?
157,ACE,157,Is this yours? Your pen?
158,JOE,158,"Yeah, that's my pen. Why?"
159,ACE,159,"I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just
didn't know whose it was. I thought
it was yours. I didn't want it to
get lost."
160,JOE,160,"Well, thank you. Why don't you take
that fuckin' pen and shove it up you
ass, you fuckin' jag-off?"
161,ACE,161,"Well, I was just offering you the-"
162,JOE,162,This fuckin' asshole.
163,MAN #1,163,Look out!
164,MAN #1,164,"Joe! Look out, Joe! Look out!"
165,NICKY,165,"What's that? You hear? You hear a
little girl, Frankie? You hear a
little girl, Ace? Is that a little
fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the
fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend
stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?!
Huh?!"
166,ACE,166,"Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta-
take it easy."
167,ACE (V.O.),167,"While I was tryin' to figure out why
the guy was sayin' what he was sayin',
Nicky just hit him. No matter how
big a guy might be, Nicky would take
him on. You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat. You beat
him with a knife, he comes back with
a gun. And you beat him with a gun,
you better kill him, because he'll
keep comin' back and back until one
of you is dead."
168,NICKY (V.O.),168,Listen...
169,NICKY (V.O.),169,"...with me protecting Ace, he made a
fortune for the bosses. I mean that's
what got him to Vegas. He was a money
machine. A tremendous earner for
these guys.  As soon as he took over,
he doubled the fuckin' drop. With
Ace the casino never saw so much
money. And the bosses, they couldn't
be happier."
170,ACE (V.O.),170,"In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-
in local cowboys working. They were
close to the, you know, good old
boys."
171,ACE,171,"Pay him six hundred a week, tell him
to walk around and look smart."
172,ACE (V.O.),172,"I mean, without us, these guys, they'd
still be shovellin' mule shit."
173,ACE,173,"Ward, you gotta keep a cleaner
station. If you need 'Mr Clean',
page him, all right?"
174,WARD,174,"It won't happen again, Sam."
175,ACE,175,Mr Rothstein.
176,ACE,176,"Is this guy just another dumb fuckin'
white man, or what? What's his story?"
177,SHERBERT,177,We need this guy.
178,ACE,178,We can't get rid of him?
179,SHERBERT,179,"He's juiced in. He's the County
Commissioner's cousin."
180,ACE,180,I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
181,ACE (V.O.),181,These yokels ran the state.
182,DEALER #1,182,"Thank you very much, Senator."
183,ACE (V.O.),183,"They passed the laws, they owned the
courts."
184,SENATOR,184,"Hi, Ace."
185,ACE,185,"Hello, Senator."
186,SENATOR,186,"Hey, I need a room. Need a room."
187,ACE,187,Good to see ya.
188,ACE,188,William would you...
189,ACE (V.O.),189,"I had dozens of politicians and state
officials comin' through that place
every week."
190,SHERBERT,190,"Nice to see you, Senator."
191,ACE,191,"Help the Senator, give him whatever
he wants."
192,SHERBERT,192,Certainly.
193,SHERBERT,193,Senator.
194,ACE (V.O.),194,Why not make them happy?
195,SHERBERT,195,"We have some nice penthouses you'll
enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite."
196,ACE (V.O.),196,For politicians...
197,ACE (V.O.),197,"...like our state senator up there,
everything was on the house."
198,ACE (V.O.),198,"These guys won their comped life
when they got elected. So, hey, why
not take advantage of it? Still, the
politicians come cheap. We could
handle them."
199,ACE (V.O.),199,"It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa,
who plays thirty thousand dollars a
hand in baccarat. That's the one you
really gotta watch."
200,ACE (V.O.),200,"He plays fast and big and he has the
cash and the credit to turn out your
lights. About a year ago, he cleaned
out a couple of casinos in the Cayman
Islands."
201,ACE (V.O.),201,"Downstairs, he takes us for two
million... and upstairs he takes
free soap, shampoo and towels. Another
billionaire cheapskate who loves his
free rooms..."
202,ACE (V.O.),202,"...free private jets, and two million
of our money."
203,ACE,203,Nice to see you again.
204,ACE (V.O.),204,"But we got him back. I had our pilot
tell him the plane was on the fritz."
205,SHERBERT,205,"Ken, I don't know what the hell went
wrong. I'm awfully sorry."
206,ICHIKAWA,206,This is a big problem. Big problem.
207,SHERBERT,207,"I can't understand it. These
mechanical things, you know, they
happen. Hey, be-better here than"
208,SHERBERT,208,"up there, you know what I mean?"
209,ACE (V.O.),209,"Then he missed the commercial flights
connecting with Japan."
210,AGENT,210,"I'm so sorry. There's a convention
in town, and all flights are booked."
211,SHERBERT,211,A convention?
212,SHERBERT,212,"I can't believe that there's a
convention. It's never... ?"
213,ICHIKAWA,213,What can I do?
214,ACE (V.O.),214,"We got him back ...with a whole floor
of rooms for himself."
215,ACE,215,I'm sorry you missed the plane.
216,ICHIKAWA,216,"You want to get my money back, right?"
217,ACE,217,"No, no, no. No gambling. No."
218,ACE (V.O.),218,"He bet one thousand a hand instead
of his usual thirty thousand a hand."
219,DEALER,219,"The bank wins a natural eight over a
five."
220,ACE (V.O.),220,"But I knew, the trick with whales
like Ichikawa was that they can't
bet small for long. He didn't think
of it as winning ten thousand, he
thought of it as losing ninety
thousand."
221,ACE (V.O.),221,"So, he upped his bets..."
222,ACE (V.O.),222,"...until he dropped his winnings
back and gave up a million of his
own cash."
223,ACE (V.O.),223,"In the casino, the cardinal rule is
to keep them playing..."
224,ACE (V.O.),224,"...and keep them coming back. The
longer they play, the more they lose.
In the end, we get it all."
225,ACE (V.O.),225,"In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch
everybody else."
226,DEALER,226,"Six, an easy way. Six! All right,
who's gonna give me..."
227,ACE (V.O.),227,"Since the players are looking to
beat the casino..."
228,DEALER,228,"...both dice must hit that back wall
each and every roll. All right, make
a six!"
229,ACE (V.O.),229,"...the dealers are watching the
players."
230,WOMAN,230,Gimme a six!
231,DEALER,231,"Come on, baby, make a six!"
232,ACE (V.O.),232,The box men are watching the dealers.
233,ACE (V.O.),233,"The floor men are watching the box
men."
234,ACE (V.O.),234,"The pit bosses are watching the floor
men."
235,ACE (V.O.),235,"The shift bosses are watching the
pit bosses."
236,ACE (V.O.),236,"The casino manager is watching the
shift bosses."
237,ACE (V.O.),237,I'm watching the casino manager.
238,ACE (V.O.),238,"And the eye-in-the-sky is watching
us all."
239,ACE (V.O.),239,Plus...
240,ACE (V.O.),240,"...we had a dozen guys up there,
most of them ex-cheats, who knew
every trick in the house."
241,HIGH ROLLER,241,"Come on, come on."
242,GINGER,242,Yes!
243,HIGH ROLLER,243,Thank you. Very nice.
244,GINGER,244,I told you I was hot tonight.
245,HIGH ROLLER,245,"Let's go. This is for Ginger. Come
on. This is for Ginger."
246,GAMBLER #1,246,"Let me have a hundred on the hard
ten. Thank you."
247,GAMBLER #2,247,Hard ten. One hundred.
248,HIGH ROLLER,248,I'm sorry.
249,GINGER,249,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
250,GINGER,250,"Thank you very much. Thank you very
much."
251,GINGER,251,"Thank you, sir, I appreciate that.
Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips
as tips to the dealer and box man.
Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances
and drive fast."
252,HIGH ROLLER,252,"Ginger, honey."
253,DEALER,253,"Thank you very much, now."
254,HIGH ROLLER,254,"Ginger, honey, this is for you love.
Thanks for your time."
255,GINGER,255,Come on.
256,HIGH ROLLER,256,What's the matter?
257,GINGER,257,"What do you mean, 'What's the matter?'
I made a lot of money for you. I
want my cut."
258,HIGH ROLLER,258,"What money? I've seen you stealing
from me."
259,GINGER,259,"What money?  Look at this stack of
chips. Don't give me that shit. I
want my end."
260,HIGH ROLLER,260,"Ginger, I've been watching you all
night. You've been stealing from me."
261,GINGER,261,"Don't give me that shit. I want my
money."
262,HIGH ROLLER,262,That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
263,GINGER,263,"What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't
steal anything from you."
264,HIGH ROLLER,264,"Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!"
265,GINGER,265,Get lost?
266,HIGH ROLLER,266,Yes.
267,GINGER,267,Get lost?
268,HIGH ROLLER,268,Yes.
269,GINGER,269,"Well, how 'bout that?"
270,HIGH ROLLER,270,Come on!
271,ACE (V.O.),271,"What a move. I fell in love right
there."
272,ACE (V.O.),272,"But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger,
love costs money."
273,GINGER,273,I'm going to go powder my nose.
274,ACE (V.O.),274,Ginger's mission in life was money.
275,GINGER,275,I'll be right back.
276,ACE (O.S.),276,"See you, Ginger."
277,GINGER,277,"Okay, thank you for asking."
278,ACE (V.O.),278,"She was a queen around the casino.
She brought in high rollers and helped
them spread around a lot of money."
279,GINGER,279,Hello.
280,VALET PARKER,280,"Hey, Ginger, how you doin'?"
281,GINGER,281,Great.
282,GINGER,282,"And I have something for you. You
got me covered?"
283,VALET PARKER,283,"Yes. Something for you, there."
284,GINGER,284,And you do. Thank you very much.
285,VALET PARKER,285,Take care of yourself.
286,GINGER,286,"I got some lucky pills for you, honey."
287,HIGH ROLLER #2,287,"Oh, yeah?"
288,ACE (V.O.),288,"Who didn't want Ginger? She was one
of the best-known, best-liked and
most respected hustlers in town.
Smart hustlers like her could keep a
guy awake for two or three days before
sending him home broke to the little
woman and his bank examiners."
289,ACE,289,Any change?
290,GINGER,290,"I hit a few... uh, games on the way
back."
291,ACE (V.O.),291,"That was all bullshit. She just
pocketed the cash."
292,GINGER,292,How you doin' tonight?
293,CASHIER,293,Good. How are you?
294,GINGER,294,"Oh, beat."
295,ACE (V.O.),295,Ginger had the hustler's code.
296,CASHIER,296,Okay.
297,GINGER,297,Take one for you.
298,CASHIER,298,Thank you.
299,ACE (V.O.),299,"She knew how to take care of people.
And that's what Vegas was all about."
300,CASHIER,300,Sixty-eight hundred.
301,GINGER,301,Thanks
302,CASHIER,302,You're welcome.
303,ACE (V.O.),303,It's Kickback City.
304,GINGER,304,You have a good night.
305,CASHIER,305,Thank you. You too.
306,ACE (V.O.),306,She took care of the dealers...
307,GINGER,307,"Hey, Mitch."
308,ACE (V.O.),308,"...pit bosses, floor managers."
309,GINGER,309,Thank you.
310,ACE (V.O.),310,But mostly...
311,ACE (V.O.),311,"...she took care of the valet parkers,
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything."
312,GINGER,312,Thanks a lot.
313,SHIFT BOSS,313,"Thank you, Ginger."
314,ACE (V.O.),314,"Ginger took care of the parkers
because they took care of the security
guards, who took care of the metro
cops, who let her operate."
315,VALET PARKER #3,315,"Thank you, Ginger."
316,GINGER,316,I need that stuff tonight.
317,VALET PARKER #3,317,No problem.
318,GINGER,318,You're a doll.
319,ACE (V.O.),319,"The valet parking job was such a
money-maker that they had to pay off
the hotel manager just to get the
concession."
320,ACE (V.O.),320,"But one thing I could never
understand, was that she could have
everything under control, except for
her old pimp boyfriend, Lester
Diamond."
321,LESTER,321,"Look, Gin, you know I got other people
in this. I got partners. But I want
you to understand that I am lookin'
out for you in this thing.  Okay?
You're going to get yours back...
and you're gonna get it back first.
Okay?"
322,GINGER,322,All right.
323,LESTER,323,Okay?
324,GINGER,324,Yeah.
325,LESTER,325,"Where are you goin'? Where are you?
You're in that place. Where are you?"
326,GINGER,326,I'm here.
327,LESTER,327,"No, you're not. Where are you? Where
are you?"
328,GINGER,328,I'm always here for you.
329,LESTER,329,You are.
330,GINGER,330,I am.
331,ACE (V.O.),331,"The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look
at this creep."
332,GINGER,332,Good luck.
333,LESTER,333,Yeah.
334,ACE (V.O.),334,"He was a moocher, a card cheat, a
country-club golf hustler. A
scumbag... chasing dentists for a
few bucks."
335,GINGER,335,Careful.
336,ACE (V.O.),336,"I mean, the guy was always broke, he
always had a story. And somehow, she
could never turn him down. The way
Ginger saw it, I guess, was that
Lester was just an unlucky guy.
Somebody had to take care of him."
337,ACE (V.O.),337,But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
338,NICKY,338,"You find any cash in there, we'll
whack it up with you."
339,ACE (V.O.),339,"I mean, he took care of himself only
too well. And that's why every badge
back home wanted to nail him."
340,JENNIFER,340,"Excuse me, but I folded these things
beautifully and I would appreciate a
little respect. Jesus Christ!"
341,NICKY,341,"Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live
with her."
342,ACE (V.O.),342,"Even after a little vacation, they
hassled him at the airport."
343,COP #1,343,Excuse me.
344,ACE (V.O.),344,"I mean, Frank Marino was there to
meet him, but so were the cops. This
time they wanted to pinch him for
some diamond burglary in Antwerp."
345,JENNIFER,345,"Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these,
please?"
346,ACE (V.O.),346,"They were ready to blame him for
anything, no matter where it happened."
347,JENNIFER,347,You go and put your things away.
348,ACE (V.O.),348,And they were usually right.
349,MARINO,349,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
350,NICKY,350,"Hold it, hold it. Here."
351,ACE (V.O.),351,"Because Nicky enjoyed being a
gangster, and he didn't give a damn
who knew it."
352,JENNIFER,352,"Come on. There we go. Look at that.
Beautiful."
353,ACE (V.O.),353,"I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause
it turns out Nicky was about to be
sent to Vegas."
354,JENNIFER,354,"All right, we're clear."
355,NICKY,355,There's more!
356,JENNIFER,356,I think that's it.
357,NICKY,357,"There's more! There's a couple stuck
in there. I know there's more."
358,JENNIFER,358,"God, I'm telling you, they're out!"
359,NICKY,359,"Come on, damn it. Don't get so
defensive. It could be stuck in your
hair, you know."
360,JENNIFER,360,"Look, there aren't..."
361,JENNIFER,361,There aren't but...
362,NICKY,362,"Oh, there aren't?"
363,NICKY,363,What's that?
364,NICKY,364,Huh? What's that.
365,NICKY,365,"There's no more. Thanks, hon."
366,NICKY (V.O.),366,"I couldn't wait to get my hands on
Vegas. But the bosses didn't send me
out there to have a good time."
367,NICKY (V.O.),367,"They sent me out there to make sure
that nobody fucked with Ace and..."
368,NICKY (V.O.),368,"...nobody interfered with the fuckin'
skim."
369,ACE,369,Hey.
370,JENNIFER,370,"Hey, how you doin'?"
371,NICKY,371,"Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?"
372,JENNIFER,372,Wow.
373,NICKY,373,"Boy, look at this place, huh?"
374,JENNIFER,374,Incredible.
375,NICKY,375,All right.
376,ACE,376,Welcome to Vegas.
377,NICKY,377,"Okay, Sammy."
378,ACE,378,"Somethin', huh?"
379,NICKY,379,Yeah.
380,ACE,380,Ginger.
381,NICKY,381,"Holy shit, what've you been doin'
out here?"
382,ACE,382,"Honey, come here."
383,ACE,383,"This is Jennifer and Nick. They're
dear friends of mine."
384,JENNIFER,384,Good to meet you.
385,GINGER,385,"Hi, Jennifer."
386,NICKY,386,Pleasure.
387,NICKY,387,Very nice to meet you.
388,GINGER,388,"Hi, how are you?"
389,NICKY,389,"Okay, Sammy."
390,ACE (V.O.),390,"After we ate, we left Jennifer and
Ginger alone and we took a ride to
talk. And then... he hit me with it."
391,NICKY,391,"What do you think about me movin'
out here?"
392,NICKY,392,"What's the matter? You got a problem
with that?"
393,ACE,393,"No, of course not."
394,NICKY,394,"You mean, I have your permission?"
395,ACE,395,"Sure, you have my permission. But I -
I just gotta tell you it's no joke
out here. It's no joke, you know?
You gotta keep a low profile. It's
not like back home. Right off the
bat, they don't like guys like us.
And this sheriff's a real cowboy.
Even the coppers aren't afraid to
bury people out in the desert here."
396,NICKY,396,"I don't care. I want to get away
from back home for a while. I'm tired
of that shit back there."
397,NICKY,397,"Look at this place. It's made of
money. You know what the best part
is? Nobody's gonna know what we're
doin'! There's nobody here to see
us! Everybody's back home."
398,ACE,398,"Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched
twice for no reason. You really gotta
be careful. I'm running a licensed
place. Everything's legit."
399,NICKY,399,"Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna
do anything. What am I gonna do?
I'm especially not gonna involve you
in anything."
400,NICKY (V.O.),400,Ace saw Vegas one way.
401,NICKY,401,"You call this guy and tell him I'm
comin'?"
402,MARINO,402,Of course.
403,NICKY (V.O.),403,"But I saw it another. I saw it as
untouched. I mean, they had bookies,
pimps and drug dealers I could shake
down. Who the fuck were they gonna
run to?  So, I started getting
everybody in line. Best of all, for
the first time in my life, I figured
out a way not to lose."
404,ACE (V.O.),404,"Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme,
all right. It wasn't very scientific
but it worked. When he won, he
collected. When he lost, he told the
bookies to go fuck themselves. What
were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?"
405,ACE (V.O.),405,Nicky was the muscle.
406,NICKY,406,Tony.
407,TONY,407,Hey.
408,NICKY,408,How you doin'?
409,TONY,409,How you doin'?
410,NICKY,410,"All right, yeah. You got that thing
for me?"
411,TONY,411,"What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought
you was layin'."
412,NICKY,412,"I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it.
I was takin' it."
413,TONY,413,You sure?
414,NICKY,414,I'm positive.
415,TONY,415,"Well, I'm a little confused here."
416,NICKY,416,You're a little confused?
417,TONY,417,Yeah.
418,NICKY,418,"Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face
through this window over here like,
you know, you'll - you'll get
unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!"
419,TONY,419,"I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean
anything by it."
420,NICKY,420,"Yeah, I know, that's why you had it
ready. You thought I was fuckin'
layin' it?!"
421,TONY,421,My fuckin' head.
422,NICKY,422,"Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck
around, Tony."
423,MARINO,423,Smarten up.
424,NICKY,424,You jag-off.
425,CLASSROOM NUN (O.S.),425,And now...
426,CLASSROOM NUN,426,"...Nicholas Santoro will come up and
tell us about our first president."
427,LITTLE NICKY,427,George Washington was born in a...
428,ACE (V.O.),428,"But still, it was nice and quiet for
a while. Ginger and I presented Nicky
and Jennifer all over town, like
regular Ozzie and Harriets."
429,LITTLE NICKY,429,...typical Virginia farmhouse.
430,DETECTIVE JOHNSON,430,Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
431,NICKY (V.O.),431,"Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved
with Little League, and it was great."
432,DETECTIVE JOHNSON,432,"Now, I want you to get out there and
get me singles and doubles, okay?
'Cause that's what's gonna win this
game."
433,NICKY (V.O.),433,"Turned out to be one of the other
coaches was a fuckin'..."
434,DETECTIVE JOHNSON,434,"Now go out there and show your dad
what you can do."
435,NICKY (V.O.),435,"...metro intelligence cop. But it
didn't matter. I mean, it was all
about the kids, you know."
436,DETECTIVE JOHNSON,436,"You know, he's gotta realize
everything can't be a home run that
he does."
437,NICKY,437,"Yeah, well, that's exactly what I
keep tellin' him, but that's the
kind of kid he is ever since he's
born."
438,DETECTIVE JOHNSON,438,"It's instinctive, you know."
439,NICKY,439,He tries to do everything...
440,NICKY,440,Ohh!
441,ACE (V.O.),441,"And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his
presence known."
442,ACE (V.O.),442,"Especially at the casino, where he
definitely did not work, people got
the message."
443,NICKY (V.O.),443,"Me? That's why the bosses sent me
out here. They wanted me to make
sure none of the other crews robbed
the joint. Like these two fuckin'
balloon-heads over here [EDDY and
JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang
us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?"
444,NICKY (V.O.),444,"Yeah, right, I'm sure."
445,JERRY,445,"Hey, Nicky. How are you?"
446,NICKY,446,"Hey, Eddy."
447,EDDY,447,"Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are
you doin' here?"
448,NICKY,448,I'm over here now.
449,JERRY/EDDY,449,You're over here?
450,JERRY,450,You're over here?
451,NICKY,451,"Yeah, I'm over here with him."
452,EDDY,452,Oh.
453,JERRY,453,Oh.
454,EDDY,454,We're waiting on Carmine.
455,JERRY,455,"Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine."
456,NICKY,456,"Carmine? He was here before. I saw
him. He had a suitcase and everything,
and then he left."
457,EDDY,457,Carmine left?
458,NICKY,458,Uh-huh.
459,JERRY,459,Carmine left?
460,EDDY,460,He's gone?
461,JERRY,461,He's not here?
462,EDDY,462,Carmine's gone.
463,NICKY,463,"I think, you know, maybe he went
across the street or somewhere else
or somethin'. I don't know."
464,EDDY,464,"Well, listen, uh... Good luck with
the joint, huh?"
465,NICKY,465,"Oh, thanks, Eddy."
466,JERRY,466,"Yeah, lots of luck. Lots of luck."
467,NICKY,467,"Hey, great, Jerry."
468,NICKY,468,Good luck to you too.
469,CREDIT CLERK,469,"Hey, they forgot to sign their papers."
470,NICKY,470,What?
471,CREDIT CLERK,471,They forgot to sign their papers.
472,NICKY,472,"Yeah, they don't need those anymore."
473,ACE (V.O.),473,"Out of respect, guys from other crews
got away with a warning."
474,ACE (V.O.),474,Everybody else: watch out.
475,ACE (V.O.),475,"Like these yokels here who never
heard of Nicky or the bosses back
home, 'cause they're the morons who
give you the most trouble. Even after
we'd catch 'em, they'd try sneakin'
back with beards and wigs and fake
noses."
476,ACE (V.O.),476,"You can spot these assholes by
watching the way they bet. Like this
guy. He's bettin' lavender chips at
five hundred each with only one little
problem. He's always guessed right.
If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd
have been tougher to spot. But in
the end, they're all greedy."
477,ACE (V.O.),477,"I saw that the dealer was weak, but
he wasn't in on it."
478,ACE (V.O.),478,"He just wasn't protecting his hand.
He was lifting his hole card way to
high."
479,ACE (V.O.),479,"Now, here's this guy..."
480,ACE (V.O.),480,...reading the dealer's hole card...
481,ACE (V.O.),481,"...and signaling his buddy [the
WINNER] at this table."
482,ACE (V.O.),482,"And that's just what these hustlers
look for. They cruise from casino to
casino, lookin' for weak dealers the
way lions look for weak antelope."
483,ACE (O.S.),483,Operator?
484,ACE,484,"This is Mr R. Get me Armstrong and
Friday over at pit two right away."
485,ACE,485,"BJ nineteen, second base, the beard
[Blackjack table number 19, second
position, man with the beard]"
486,ACE,486,"Operator... I need Mr Happy, loud."
487,WAITRESSES,487,"Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday
to you. Happy Birthday, dear Jeff.
Happy Birthday to you."
488,SECURITY GUARD #1,488,Man down!
489,SECURITY GUARD #1,489,"Notify medical! We got a cardiac
arrest here!"
490,SECURITY GUARD #2,490,"He's fine, folks. Just give us some
room, please!"
491,ACE (V.O.),491,Watch it now.
492,SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.),492,Stand back!
493,ACE (V.O.),493,"They never know what hit them. And
if and when..."
494,ACE (V.O.),494,"...they do find out they just got
zapped by a cattle prod..."
495,ACE (V.O.),495,"...they wish they really did have a
heart attack."
496,ACE (V.O.),496,"Turns out this guy and his fuckin'
pals, they were knockin' this place
dead for years."
497,SECURITY GUARD #1,497,He's got a wire on him.
498,SIGNALER,498,"Hey, hey, what are you doin', man?"
499,SECURITY GUARD #2,499,There it is! On the table!
500,SECURITY GUARD #1,500,Cheater's justice!
501,SIGNALER,501,"Oh, God! Oh!"
502,SIGNALER,502,"Hey, no! No! No!"
503,ACE (V.O.),503,"We had to make an example of these
pricks that the party was over."
504,ACE,504,"I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling
your checks with your right hand.
Can you do that with both hands?"
505,SIGNALER,505,No.
506,ACE,506,Can't do it with both hands?
507,SIGNALER,507,"No, Sir."
508,ACE,508,Can you do it with your left hand?
509,SIGNALER,509,"Well, I... I never tried."
510,ACE,510,"So, you're a righty?"
511,SIGNALER,511,Ye-yeah.
512,ACE,512,"Now, you're gonna have to learn with
your left hand."
513,SIGNALER,513,God!
514,WINNER (O.S.),514,It's a hundred...
515,WINNER,515,...a hundred ten.
516,CASHIER,516,"Yes, it is."
517,WINNER,517,I think.
518,CASHIER,518,Yes.
519,WINNER,519,Okay.
520,SHERBERT,520,"Hiya. That's a lot of money to be
counting out in public."
521,WINNER,521,Yeah.
522,SHERBERT,522,"Why don't I take him over to the
office and verify it, huh?"
523,CASHIER,523,Yes.
524,SHERBERT,524,"A little privacy. And, by the way,
send over a... nice bottle of
champagne on ice, huh?"
525,CASHIER,525,Sure will.
526,SHERBERT,526,Real special.  Somethin'...
527,SHERBERT,527,"By the way...  I'm Billy Sherbert,
your casino manager."
528,WINNER,528,Hi.
529,SHERBERT,529,Having a good time?
530,WINNER,530,"Yes, uh..."
531,SHERBERT,531,"You'll want to count the money in
privacy. You know, you don't need..."
532,WINNER,532,"Uh, I have a plane to catch to
Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?"
533,SIGNALER,533,"Look what they did to my hand, man!"
534,ACE,534,"All right, I'm gonna give you a
choice. You can either have the money
and the hammer or you can walk out
of here. You can't have both. What
do you want?"
535,WINNER,535,I just wanna get out of here.
536,ACE,536,"And don't forget to tell your friends
what happens if they fuck around in
here. You understand?"
537,WINNER,537,I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
538,ACE,538,"You're fuckin' right, you made a bad
mistake. 'Cause if you come back
here - we catch either one of you -
we're gonna break your fuckin' heads
and you won't walk out of here. You
see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna
use it. You don't fuck around in
this place. You got it?"
539,WINNER,539,Yeah.
540,ACE,540,Get out of here.
541,WINNER,541,Thank you.
542,ACE,542,"Throw him out in the alley.  And
just tell the cops he got hit by a
car."
543,ACE (V.O.),543,"Within no time, everything was set
in place. We got rid of the freelance
scamsters. The per was way up.  The
gods were happy, or as happy as the
gods can ever be.  And I, I decided
to complicate my life. For a guy who
likes sure things, I was about to
bet the rest of my life on a real
longshot."
544,ACE,544,"We're not getting any younger. Don't
you think it's time? Aren't you
gettin' tired of all this shit?
Bangin' around, hustlin' around?"
545,GINGER,545,"What, are you trying to handicap me?"
546,ACE,546,"I'm gonna do you one better. I'm
trying to marry you. You want to
marry me?"
547,ACE,547,"I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to
settle down. I want a family."
548,GINGER,548,"You got the wrong girl, Sam."
549,ACE,549,"I know I'd be a good father. I know
you'd be a good mother."
550,GINGER,550,"You don't know me. What, you've known
me, two, three months. What do you
know?"
551,ACE,551,"I'm forty-three years old. I don't
want to wait. I know you well enough
to know that I really love you very
much.  And I can't think of anybody
better to be with. And I don't feel
like waiting anymore."
552,GINGER,552,"You know a lot of happily married
people, Sam? 'Cause I don't."
553,ACE,553,"Yeah, I know all that."
554,GINGER,554,"I care about you, a - But I just
don't have those kind of feelings
for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love
with you."
555,ACE,555,I - I - I...
556,GINGER,556,Understand?
557,GINGER,557,I'm sorry.
558,ACE,558,"No, I - I... mean...  that can grow
as I - as long as there's a mutual
respect... that kind of thing can
grow. I'm realistic. I can accept
that. But, you know, what is...
What is love anyway?  It's a... it's
a mutual respect. It's - it's a
devotion. It's a... it's a caring
from one person to another. And if
we could set up some kind of
foundation...  based on that mutual
respect...  I feel that eventually
you would care enough about me...
that I could live with that."
559,GINGER,559,"If it doesn't work out. You know, if
it doesn't play out, then what happens
to me?"
560,ACE,560,"You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm
gonna do even better. And so, whatever
happens, if it doesn't work out
between us, I'm gonna make sure you're
okay for the rest of your life. And
if there are kids, especially, you
know, I'll take care of you better
than you'd ever imagine."
561,GINGER,561,"What're you... what're you pitching
me, here?"
562,ACE,562,"Just what I said. You'll be set up
for the rest of your life. That I
can promise you."
563,ACE,563,Want to take a chance?
564,ACE (V.O.),564,"When I married Ginger I knew all the
stories, but I didn't give a fuck.
'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can
change her.'"
565,NICKY (V.O.),565,"It was typical Ace. He invited the
biggest people in town and he knew
they'd show. Because he knew they
all wanted somethin' from him.  With
Ace, nobody ever got a free ride.
Even Ginger. With her -"
566,NICKY (V.O.),566,"- he still covered his bets. They
had to have the baby first, before
they got married. Even made Jennie
and me watch Amy for a few days when
they went on their honeymoon. But I
didn't mind, we loved the kid."
567,LESTER,567,"Can you feel my eyes on you? Can you
feel me look into your heart?  Can
you feel me in the pit of your
stomach? Can you feel me in you? In
your heart?"
568,LESTER,568,Don't make me come there. Answer me.
569,GINGER,569,I love you.
570,LESTER,570,"Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I
love you too?"
571,GINGER,571,"No, Lester."
572,LESTER,572,Do you know that?
573,GINGER,573,"Yeah. This is the best thing I can
do for my life right now."
574,LESTER,574,That's right.
575,LESTER,575,"So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?"
576,GINGER,576,Promise?
577,LESTER,577,God... I wish you...
578,LESTER,578,...all the luck in the world.
579,GINGER,579,You do?
580,LESTER,580,"Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the -
it's the best thing you can do right
now. I mean this. And you'll have
real security.  Sweetheart... you're
gonna be situated just right in Vegas."
581,LESTER,581,"Come on, this is great for us. You
know I'm gonna be here for you. I
ain't going no place. Huh?  I'm
lookin' at you right now. I'm seein'
you for the very first time, right
this minute. I'm seein' you, and I
can feel my heart click. I see you
fourteen years old. I see you the
first second I ever saw you. I see
you, long-legged little colt -"
582,LESTER,582,- with stupid braces on your teeth.
583,GINGER,583,"Okay, then."
584,LESTER,584,"Every time I ever see you, that's
what I see."
585,GINGER,585,"Uh, talk to you later.  Bye."
586,ACE,586,You all right?
587,GINGER,587,Yeah.
588,ACE,588,Why're you crying?
589,GINGER,589,I'm not crying.
590,ACE,590,Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
591,GINGER,591,I'm okay. I just -
592,GINGER,592,"You just have to understand. I've
been with Lester since I was a kid.
I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I
just...  I don't... I think I have a
right to do that. Okay?"
593,ACE,593,"It's all right. That part of your
life is over with. Right?"
594,GINGER,594,Yeah.
595,ACE,595,You're with me now.
596,GINGER,596,Yeah.
597,ACE,597,Right?
598,GINGER,598,Uh-huh.
599,ACE,599,You sure?
600,GINGER,600,Yeah. Yeah.
601,ACE,601,Want to go? Let's go back in.
602,GINGER,602,Okay.
603,GINGER,603,Oh...
604,GINGER,604,It's great.
605,GINGER,605,"Oh, it's great."
606,GINGER,606,"Oh! It's all my stuff. Oh, my God."
607,GINGER,607,You brought all my stuff. I can -
608,ACE,608,Try it on. It's yours.
609,GINGER,609,You're kidding? My God. What is it?
610,ACE,610,It's chinchilla.
611,GINGER,611,"Oh, it's so soft."
612,ACE,612,It's nice isn't it?
613,GINGER,613,Oh...
614,GINGER,614,No one's ever been so nice to me.
615,GINGER,615,"Oh, my God."
616,GINGER,616,"So, do you think it's too much if I
wear these in the same day?"
617,ACE,617,"You do whatever you want. Do I keep
my promises, or do I keep my promises?"
618,GINGER,618,"You're so wonderful. The jewelry's
not so bad, either."
619,ACE,619,"The only thing is... you shouldn't
keep this in the house. We gotta put
it in a bank."
620,GINGER,620,"Come on. Can I keep this one in the
house?"
621,ACE,621,"Now look,"
622,ACE,622,"pay attention to me. What I'm gonna
tell you is very important."
623,GINGER,623,Okay.
624,ACE,624,"All this stuff doesn't mean anything.
Money, this, doesn't mean anything
without trust. I have to be able to
trust you with my life."
625,ACE (V.O.),625,"With over a million in cash and jewels
tucked in a bank in Vegas only for
Ginger, she was secure and happy."
626,ACE (V.O.),626,"She loved that shit. But a guy in my
line of work has to have a lot of
pay-off cash around."
627,ACE (V.O.),627,"Crooked cops and kidnappers, they
don't take checks."
628,GINGER,628,"Need a little help with that, Mr
Collins?"
629,ACE (V.O.),629,"So, I put two million in cash in a
Los Angeles bank under the name of
Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was
strictly my shakedown and kidnapping
money."
630,ACE (V.O.),630,"And, since I'd either be in jail or
locked in a closet when I needed the
money the most..."
631,ACE (V.O.),631,"...I gave Ginger the only key to the
cash that could get me back alive."
632,BANKER,632,Now this is just a signature card.
633,ACE,633,"So, once she signs those papers,
she'll be the only person to have
total access to the box?  No one
else, including myself?"
634,BANKER,634,That's right.
635,BANKER,635,"That's the way you wanted it, right?"
636,BANKER,636,"Sam, let me ask you a question. You
must really trust your wife."
637,ACE,637,"Yeah, sure I do. Why?"
638,BANKER,638,"No, tha-that's good. It's just
unusual. To tell you the truth, so
many of my clients don't."
639,ACE,639,Well...
640,ACE (V.O.),640,"With Ginger and the money in place,
I felt covered, and to play it safe
I switched job titles again and made
myself, um, Food and Beverage
Director. This way nobody would bother
me about a license. I mean, Vegas
was like a dream for me. Trouble
was..."
641,ACE (V.O.),641,"...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind
of Vegas."
642,NICKY (V.O.),642,"To begin, I put money out on the
streets, chargin' three points a
week. You know - juice to the fuckin'
dealers."
643,MARINO,643,Don't make us come lookin' for you.
644,MIKE,644,"Oh, you won't have to look for me. I
appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky."
645,NICKY,645,"All right, Mike."
646,NICKY (V.O.),646,"They were degenerate gamblers, coke
freaks. In no time, I had half the
dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.
Then..."
647,NICKY (V.O.),647,"...the next thing I did, I started
bustin' out high-stakes poker players."
648,ACE (V.O.),648,"It was so obvious. I mean, all of
Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they
were real signal happy."
649,MOOSH,649,I'm gonna open for five hundred.
650,ROCKY,650,"Moosh, you open?"
651,ACE (V.O.),651,Signaling back and forth.
652,CARD SHARK,652,I bet thirty-five hundred.
653,DOCTOR DAN,653,"I've been losing for three days
straight, non-stop."
654,ROCKY,654,"Oh, why're you crying, with three
loaves of bread under your arm?"
655,ACE (V.O.),655,"Nicky thought nobody was watching
him. But he was wrong."
656,ACE (V.O.),656,"And I didn't want any of those agents
near my place."
657,NICKY,657,"Four aces, Doc."
658,NICKY,658,What do you got?
659,DOCTOR DAN,659,Jesus Christ. I can't believe it.
660,DOCTOR DAN,660,"If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't
have any luck. I'm out of here, you
understand?"
661,ACE (V.O.),661,"I mean, I wished to God Nicky and
his whole crew would just get lost."
662,ACE (V.O.),662,"What am I gonna do? Go back home and
start a war?"
663,ACE (V.O.),663,"I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm
not. I can't do that."
664,ACE,664,"Be careful. Gaming agents are all
over the place."
665,NICKY,665,"So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to
get lucky in this place?"
666,ACE,666,"You been lucky all week. They're
lookin' to nail ya."
667,NICKY (V.O.),667,"Ace was so fuckin' worried about his
casino, he forgot what we were doin'
out here in the first place."
668,NICKY (V.O.),668,"A million times I wanted to yell in
his fuckin' ear: 'This is Las Vegas!
We're supposed to be out here robbin',
you dumb fuckin' Heeb.'"
669,ACE,669,"I don't give a shit who he's connected
to. Tell him to take his fuckin'
feet off the table. What's he think
this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?"
670,SHERBERT,670,"Sir, would you mind taking your feet
off the table and putting your shoes
on, please?"
671,COWBOY,671,"Yeah, I would mind. I'm havin' a bad
night."
672,SHERBERT,672,Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
673,ACE,673,Call security.
674,ACE,674,How are you?
675,COWBOY,675,Good. How are you?
676,ACE,676,"Good. You want to do me a favor? You
want to take your feet off the table
and put your shoes back on?"
677,COWBOY,677,Fuck you.
678,ACE,678,"I want you to exit this guy off the
premises, and I want you to exit him
off his feet and use his head to
open the fuckin' door."
679,SECURITY GUARD #1,679,"Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You
mind accompanying us outside?"
680,COWBOY,680,"Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere
with you!"
681,SECURITY GUARD #1,681,"Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!"
682,COWBOY,682,Fuck you! Fuck you!
683,SECURITY GUARD #1,683,Yeah?
684,COWBOY,684,"You know who you're fuckin' with?!
Huh? Do you?!"
685,SECURITY GUARD #1,685,Now move along.
686,COWBOY,686,"You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who
you're fuckin' with?"
687,COWBOY,687,Leave me alone!
688,SECURITY GUARD #1,688,Here we go!
689,COWBOY,689,You've gotta be kidding me!
690,ACE (V.O.),690,"Sure enough, an hour later, I get
the call."
691,NICKY,691,"Ace, what happened over there? I
mean, did you know that guy you threw
out was with me?"
692,ACE,692,"No, I didn't know that. But you know
what he did?"
693,NICKY,693,No.
694,ACE,694,"He insulted Billy. And then I walked
over to him politely..."
695,ACE,695,...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
696,NICKY,696,What?
697,ACE,697,Then he called me a faggot.
698,ACE,698,"So what do you think I do? I threw
that cocksucker out."
699,NICKY,699,What? Ho-
700,NICKY,700,"Hey, come here."
701,NICKY,701,"You called my friend a faggot? You
tell him to go fuck himself?"
702,COWBOY,702,"Nicky, I did -"
703,NICKY,703,Is that what you did?
704,COWBOY,704,I did - I didn't -
705,NICKY,705,"Tell him to go fuck himself? You
fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'..."
706,NICKY,706,"...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come
here. Come here. Get him up. Come
here."
707,MARINO,707,Get up.
708,NICKY,708,"Come here, come here."
709,MARINO,709,Get up.
710,NICKY,710,"You go over there right now and you
apologize. You better hope he lets
you back in."
711,NICKY,711,"If you ever get out of line over
there again, I'll smash your fuckin'
head so hard..."
712,NICKY,712,"...you won't be able to get that
cowboy hat on. You hear me? Fuckin'
hick."
713,NICKY,713,"Sammy, listen..."
714,NICKY,714,"...this guy obviously doesn't know
who he was talkin' to, you understand?
He doesn't..."
715,NICKY,715,"...know that, uh, we're dear friends.
I mean, he's already very sorry.
But, uh, if you could do me a favor
to let him back in, I swear to you
he'll never get out of line again. I
promise you that."
716,ACE,716,"If he does it again, he's out for
good. I don't care what it is, Nick,
I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let
him in the place again."
717,NICKY,717,I'm sorry about this. Really.
718,NICKY,718,"All right, Ace?"
719,ACE,719,Okay.
720,NICKY,720,"Thanks, pal."
721,NICKY,721,"You took your boots off? You put
your feet on the table... you shit-
kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin'
motherfucker you!  You fuck me up
over there, I'll stick you in a hole
in the fuckin' desert! You understand?"
722,NICKY,722,Go over there and apologize.
723,NICKY,723,Go! Get the fuck out of -
724,COWBOY,724,"Nicky, I'm sorry."
725,NICKY (V.O.),725,"You know, Ace could be a very touchy
guy, especially when he got bigger
and bigger in town. Like when he
hired that Jonathon and David and
their tigers away from the Palace by
buildin' them a new stage and then
givin' them a silver Rolls Royce."
726,NICKY (V.O.),726,"But I'll tell you, he knew how to
bring in the crowds. He knew all the
fuckin' angles. He brought over the
whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris.
But he forgot how lazy them European
dancin' broads can get. I mean, he
had to weigh 'em in once a week to
make sure they didn't blow up like
fuckin' balloons."
727,ACE,727,You're still eight pounds over.
728,ACE,728,What's the reason for this?
729,STAGE MANAGER,729,"Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on
suspension."
730,ACE,730,"Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the
'sir'."
731,STAGE MANAGER,731,"Well, sir, I was just..."
732,ACE,732,Why is she eight pounds over?
733,STAGE MANAGER,733,"...trying to offer you the respect
that your..."
734,ACE,734,I...
735,STAGE MANAGER,735,...position...
736,ACE,736,'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
737,STAGE MANAGER,737,"Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes,
when you reach that pressure point,
when you put that pressure point on
them, you know, it shows..."
738,ACE,738,"She could at least lose half a pound
or a quarter.  Listen..."
739,STAGE MANAGER,739,...and she doesn't always -
740,ACE,740,"...all you do is give me answers.
Just - just give me the right answer."
741,STAGE MANAGER,741,"But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I
guess, maybe, because she's frightened
that if she doesn't lose the weight
she may even get fired."
742,ACE,742,"That's right. She will get fired. In
fact, I want you to send her back to
Paris."
743,STAGE MANAGER,743,It's always been our policy -
744,ACE,744,No. Just stop everything.
745,SHERBERT,745,This woman's an institution.
746,ACE,746,"I don't care what she is. She's an
institution, that's the problem.
She's lazy."
747,NICKY (V.O.),747,"Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He
does the most obvious thing. This is
the only town in the country where a
bookie joint is legit, so, why not
take advantage, right?  So... he
took bookie joints off the street
and then opened them up inside the
casino. Well, within a few years, by
doin' all of this, he had every casino
on the Strip trying to copy off him."
748,ACE (V.O.),748,Between...
749,ACE (V.O.),749,...my innovations...
750,ACE (V.O.),750,"...and Nicky's dedication to his
job..."
751,ACE (V.O.),751,"...I soon had the best operation on
the Strip."
752,ACE,752,"You better watch yourself. There's a
lot of heat on you already."
753,NICKY,753,"Why, somebody's complaining?"
754,ACE,754,"I'm - I'm hearin' things from
security. They're all ex-cops. The
Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls.
They want to put you in the Black
Book."
755,NICKY,755,"That Black Book is a bunch of
bullshit. They got two names in there
for the whole country and one of
them is still Al Capone."
756,ACE,756,"Bullshit or no bullshit, they put
you in that book, you're gonna be in
a lot of trouble. You will not be
able to walk into the casino. I'm
tellin' you."
757,NICKY,757,"What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin'
to make a livin', that's all."
758,ACE,758,"I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I
didn't warn you."
759,NICKY,759,All right.
760,PHOTOGRAPHER #1,760,"Mrs Rothstein, look straight ahead.
Very nice. Thank you."
761,PHOTOGRAPHER #2,761,Thank you.
762,PHOTOGRAPHER #1,762,"Yes, nice smile."
763,PHOTOGRAPHER #3,763,"Just look right at the camera. Hold
that pose."
764,GREEN (O.S.),764,"Considering all of his hard work and
dedication and the new lifeblood he
has instilled in Las Vegas..."
765,GREEN,765,"Sam has established himself as an
indispensable member of the gaming
community. As the head of the Tangiers
Gaming Corporation, it's my pleasure
to welcome Sam Rothstein to the Vegas
Valley Country Club."
766,ACE (V.O.),766,"Back home, they would have put me in
jail for what I'm doing. But out
here, they're givin' me awards."
767,ACE,767,"It's with great pleasure that I accept
this certificate of appreciation
from the..."
768,COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #1,768,"Congratulations, sweetheart."
769,GINGER,769,Thank you.
770,COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #2,770,"Sam raised more than we've ever raised
before."
771,GINGER,771,He worked so hard.
772,ACE (V.O.),772,"But my greatest pleasure was watchin'
my wife, Ginger, work the room."
773,COUNTRY-CLUB MAN #1,773,Thank you for everything.
774,ACE (V.O.),774,"They all loved her. How could you
not live her?"
775,GINGER,775,Hi. Nice to see you.
776,ACE (V.O.),776,"She could be the most charming woman
you ever saw. People loved to be
around her."
777,COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3,777,"Listen, you've got to bring Amy to
Sasha's birthday party because he'd
love to have her there."
778,GINGER,778,Thanks.
779,COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3,779,We'll see you three o'clock Saturday.
780,GINGER,780,"Thanks. Yes, all right."
781,COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3,781,Great.
782,ACE (V.O.),782,She made everybody feel good.
783,EXECUTIVE,783,"Congratulations, Sam."
784,ACE,784,"Oh, thanks."
785,EXECUTIVE,785,"Hello, Mrs Rothstein."
786,GINGER,786,Hi.
787,EXECUTIVE,787,How are you?
788,GINGER,788,Oh.
789,EXECUTIVE,789,"You're one of the most gorgeous women
I've ever seen. You're a lucky man
Mr Rothstein."
790,ACE,790,Thank you. Thanks for that compliment.
791,ACE (V.O.),791,"He was a young kid from the casino...
nice kid...  bright boy. What balls
on this fuckin' kid! The next day I
fired him."
792,GINGER,792,"Hey, do you want to see this one?
Daddy gave me all this jewelry because
he loves me so much. (She places a
gold bracelet on AMY's hand.) Put
your arm in there."
793,ACE (V.O.),793,But as much as they loved her...
794,GINGER,794,"Oh, fabulous."
795,ACE (V.O.),795,"...they didn't know what really moved
her."
796,GINGER,796,Look at this. Look at this.
797,GINGER (O.S.),797,"Daddy gave me this pin when we were
dating."
798,ACE (V.O.),798,"And with Ginger happy, I was able to
concentrate on what I knew best."
799,WARD,799,"Loose machines are right back over
there."
800,ACE,800,"What are they doin' way back there?
Bring 'em up here where they belong.
You can't even see 'em over there."
801,WARD,801,"Okay, I'll -"
802,ACE,802,"What about the progressives with the
high jackpots? Where are they? These
machines are hidden."
803,WARD,803,Well...
804,ACE,804,"These are our best machines. They
bring all the action. No wonder the
drop is off."
805,WARD,805,"Yeah, okay."
806,ACE,806,"The action is in the front, not in
the back. Bring 'em up front."
807,WARD,807,"All right, I will, I will."
808,ACE,808,"Listen to me very carefully. There
are three ways of doing things around
here. The right way, the wrong way,
and the way I do it. You understand?"
809,WARD,809,"I do understand that. I'll get right
on it. And thank you."
810,ACE,810,"Don't thank me, just do it. You're
the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have
to tell you this."
811,WARD,811,"Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I
am so sorry."
812,ACE (V.O.),812,"So, I ended up workin' what? Eighteen-
hour days?  Ginger was the one who
wound up enjoying the best of Vegas."
813,MAITRE D',813,"Come with me, please. I have a better
table for you.  Sorry."
814,JENNIFER,814,"So, what'd you say to that fuckin'
jerk anyway?"
815,GINGER,815,I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
816,JENNIFER,816,"Well, you might as well get somethin'
out of it."
817,ACE (V.O.),817,"Well, it wasn't long before what I
was afraid was gonna happen, happened.
Nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in Las Vegas, and
from then on, I couldn't be seen
talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or
even near it."
818,NICKY,818,"What the fuck is that supposed to
mean?"
819,NICKY,819,"' ...detrimental to gaming. And he
will be ejected from any casino in
Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be
fined as much as a hundred thousand
every time he shows up.'"
820,NICKY,820,Do you believe this shit?
821,ACE,821,"Yeah, I believe it. You got banned."
822,NICKY,822,"'Who is of notorious and unsavory
reputation...'"
823,NICKY,823,"Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'...
Is there any way around this?"
824,ACE,824,"Nope, there's no way."
825,NICKY,825,"Let's say... for instance... I want
to go in the restaurant which happens
to be in the casino... to get one of
those sandwiches I like?"
826,ACE,826,"Forget it. You can't even set foot
in the parking lot. That's how serious
it is."
827,NICKY,827,"In other words, I'm fucked."
828,ACE,828,"In so many words, yes."
829,ACE (V.O.),829,"It just didn't sink into his head
about the Black Book and what it
meant. Not being able to go into a
casino is just one thing, but being
in this book etched your name into
the brains of every cop and FBI agent
in the state. I mean, you're listed
in there with Al Capone. But Nicky
didn't care."
830,NICKY,830,"I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do
somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of
me. They're not gettin' rid of me.
I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck
'em."
831,NICKY (V.O.),831,"So, once they pulled that shit, I
started doin' my own things in Vegas
nobody ever thought of doin'. To
keep an eye on things, I brought in
my kid brother Dominick... and some
desperadoes from back home and started
knockin' over high rollers, casino
bosses, bookmakers, anybody, right
here in town. I had a good fuckin'
crew goin' for me, I'll tell you
that."
832,NICKY (V.O.),832,"I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story
guy. Jack Hardy, he worked for a
safe company after he did a six-year
bit. And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy could bypass any alarm for
me. And I opened up my own jewelry
store, too: 'The Gold Rush'."
833,NICKY (V.O.),833,"Sometimes I used to go along on a
heist just for the fun of it. But I
didn't like the people I was rippin'
off lookin' at me, so I used to turn
their fuckin' pictures around."
834,NICKY,834,What's takin' so long over there?
835,MARINO,835,This peter's a motherfucker.
836,HARDY,836,"It's workin'. Just keep workin' it.
It's comin'."
837,NICKY,837,"Gotta learn how to open these fuckin'
things so you won't have to take
'em."
838,NICKY,838,"Frankie, some of these stones got a
lot of niggers in 'em."
839,NICKY,839,"Tell that fuckin' Pepe if he's
switching stones on us, he'd better
take a fuckin' camel -"
840,NICKY,840,- back to
841,NICKY,841,Nigeria.
842,NICKY,842,Yeah.
843,HOTEL RECEPTIONIST,843,Listen...
844,HOTEL RECEPTIONIST,844,...they're in Penthouse K.
845,NICKY,845,They check in alone?
846,HOTEL RECEPTIONIST,846,They checked in alone.
847,NICKY,847,Are they out now?
848,HOTEL RECEPTIONIST,848,"Yes, don't worry."
849,NICKY,849,All right.
850,NICKY,850,Thanks.
851,ACE (V.O.),851,He had tipsters...
852,ACE (V.O.),852,...all over town. Bellmen.
853,BELLMAN,853,"(Into telephone) This one looks good.
But you got to hurry."
854,MARINO,854,Yeah...
855,MARINO,855,"...yeah, okay."
856,ACE (V.O.),856,Valet parkers.
857,VALET PARKER,857,They're just checking in now.
858,FUSCO,858,"Okay, I'll tell him."
859,ACE (V.O.),859,Pit bosses.
860,PIT BOSS,860,"Yeah, room twelve-thirty, at the
Sirocco."
861,MARINO,861,"Twelve-thirty, right."
862,ACE (V.O.),862,Secretaries.
863,SECRETARY,863,It's all in mint condition coins.
864,HARDY,864,Mint condition. All right.
865,ACE (V.O.),865,And they all...
866,ACE (V.O.),866,...got a piece of the score.
867,HARDY,867,Car's comin'.
868,ACE (V.O.),868,"They were always very careful. And
they always bypassed the alarms, or
else... if not, they'd drill enough
holes to knock through the walls
with a sledgehammer..."
869,ACE (V.O.),869,"Nobody out there was expecting a guy
like him."
870,ACE (V.O.),870,"For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fuckin'
Wild West."
871,STORE OWNER,871,"I just got a shipment of diamonds
from Israel..."
872,NICKY (V.O.),872,"But what the fuck they expect from
me? I had to earn, didn't I?"
873,IRANIAN #1,873,"You know, this diamond has flaws in
it."
874,MARINO,874,"No, no, there's no flaws in it."
875,IRANIAN #2,875,"Don't tell me. I'm doing this for
twenty-five years."
876,MARINO,876,"You better clean your fuckin' loupe.
'Cause there's no flaws in these
diamonds."
877,NICKY (V.O.),877,"Whenever we got local merch, we'd
usually send it to Palm Spring or
Arizona... LA. I had a couple of
sand niggers out there. You know,
Arabs."
878,MARINO,878,"What, are you gonna have a fuckin'
meeting here, or are you gonna buy
some diamonds?"
879,IRANIAN #2,879,"No, no. I know his language. I'm
talking with him."
880,MARINO,880,"Forty thousand dollars, you can buy
the whole package."
881,IRANIAN #1,881,"Twenty thousand, and that's my final
offer and..."
882,MARINO,882,"All of a sudden he talks English,
now."
883,MARINO,883,"Let's talk turkey here, how 'bout
twenty-five thousand?"
884,NICKY (V.O.),884,"I actually turned my bedroom into a
bank vault where I kept the choice
stuff."
885,MARINO,885,She asleep?
886,NICKY,886,"Every night, on the couch."
887,NICKY (V.O.),887,"I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush
in case we got raided by the cops...
or if my crew got cute."
888,NICKY (V.O.),888,I had the only key.
889,NICKY (V.O.),889,"Jennifer didn't give a fuck. She
used to fall asleep on the couch
watchin' television every night.
This stuff was all mine. I didn't
send any of this back home."
890,NICKY (V.O.),890,"Actually, I couldn't because I wasn't
even supposed to be doin' it. The
bosses were makin' so much fuckin'
money with the casinos"
891,NICKY (V.O.),891,"that they didn't want anybody makin'
any waves for them."
892,NICKY,892,"Give all the guys in your crew a
piece of that?"
893,MARINO,893,I took care of everybody.
894,NICKY,894,Yeah?
895,NICKY (V.O.),895,"That's why there was no real organized
street stuff in Vegas before I came
here."
896,CHARLIE CLARK,896,"Yeah, that works out."
897,NICKY (V.O.),897,"But how much cash could I bury in my
closet, right?"
898,CHARLIE CLARK,898,"You need to understand, and I - I'm
sure you do... that in a venture of
this kind, you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss."
899,NICKY,899,"Oh, listen, I understand that there's
always a risk... you know, I might
have to take a loss somewhere."
900,NICKY (V.O.),900,"So I put some of the money into
legitimate deals with Charlie Clark.
He was Ace's banker."
901,NICKY,901,"I mean, you will try to push it
through, won't you, Mr Clark?"
902,CHARLIE CLARK,902,Yes.
903,NICKY,903,"Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving
you fifty thousand cash."
904,NICKY (V.O.),904,Then I put some more of the money...
905,NICKY (V.O.),905,"...in some legitimate places, like
my restaurant."
906,DOMINICK,906,Is that the last one?
907,COOK,907,Yeah.
908,NICKY (V.O.),908,"I had my kid brother, Dominick, run
it for me."
909,DOMINICK,909,Fuckers!
910,DOMINICK,910,"Here you go, guys."
911,COP #1,911,"All right. Thanks, a lot."
912,DOMINICK,912,"Yeah... yeah, enjoy."
913,COP #2,913,Yeah.
914,DOMINICK,914,Have a good time.
915,DOMINICK,915,"Choke on it, ya motherfucker!"
916,MAN #1,916,"Hey, Dom."
917,DOMINICK,917,"Hey, how you doin'?"
918,ACE (V.O.),918,"Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He
was a real restaurant buff. And over
the years, he always made money with
them."
919,NICKY,919,"Hey, Rich."
920,ACE (V.O.),920,"In Vegas, he had The Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot. He had
politicians, showgirls and movies
stars hangin' out all over the place."
921,NICKY,921,"Listen, that show over at the Flamingo
gets better and better."
922,STEVE ALLEN,922,"By the way, Sammy said whenever you
have a minute, give him a call."
923,NICKY,923,"Made a messenger out of you too,
huh?"
924,STEVE ALLEN,924,I'll do anything for a buck.
925,NICKY,925,"He does it. He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner."
926,JAYNE MEADOWS,926,Thanks.
927,STEVE ALLEN,927,"Okay, thanks."
928,ACE (V.O.),928,"But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky
liked the most was the showgirls,
naturally. I mean, to them, Nicky
was the movie star."
929,NICKY,929,You walk past me?
930,MARINO,930,Hey. This is Shelly.
931,NICKY,931,"Hey, Shelly."
932,SHELLY,932,Hi.
933,NICKY,933,How are you? Nice to meet you.
934,MARINO,934,And this is Stacy.
935,NICKY,935,Stacy.
936,MARINO,936,This is Nick.
937,NICKY,937,Pleasure.
938,STACY,938,"Hi, Nick."
939,MARINO,939,We're gonna have dinner. Come on.
940,NICKY,940,"All right, uh,"
941,NICKY,941,"Let's just check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second. Come on, I'll
show you."
942,NICKY (V.O.),942,"'Cause I fly stuff in fresh every
day."
943,NICKY,943,"I get bread from back home. I get
fish from California. And you can
always tell a great kitchen like
ours because of the milk-fed veal.
That's the secret."
944,NICKY,944,"See, milk-fed veal is pure white.
Out here, they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey."
945,NICKY,945,"Now, pink veal, you can pound that
shit for two days and it'll never
get tender, you know what I mean?"
946,AL,946,When I left here with the money...
947,NICKY,947,Mm.
948,AL,948,...I got muscled on the street.
949,NICKY,949,Mm.
950,AL,950,"A couple of guys, I owe them. So,
that's what I did. I gave 'em the
money.  That's what I did."
951,NICKY,951,Yeah?
952,AL,952,Yeah.
953,NICKY,953,"You call yourself a man? You know
you're a lyin', low-life,
motherfuckin' gambling degenerate
prick? You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home. I gave you
money to pay the fuckin' rent and
buy groceries, put the heat on. You
know your wife called Frankie and
told him the fuckin' heat's off?"
954,NICKY,954,"Huh? And you didn't gamble that
fuckin' money? You're gonna stand
here and tell me that?"
955,NICKY,955,"No, no? You didn't?"
956,AL,956,I didn't give 'em the m-
957,NICKY,957,"Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a
fuck out of me! You want to embarrass
me and make a fool out of me?!  You
didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled
the fuckin' money, I'll give you the
fuckin' money to put the fuckin'
heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!"
958,NICKY,958,"Fuckin' degenerate, you."
959,NICKY,959,Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.
960,NICKY,960,Get the fuck out of here.
961,AL,961,"Thanks, Nick."
962,NICKY,962,"Yeah, thanks."
963,NICKY,963,"Let me find out you fucked up, I'll
leave you wherever I find you."
964,NICKY,964,"How many of these you gonna eat,
huh?"
965,LITTLE NICKY,965,Two.
966,NICKY,966,Two?
967,ACE (V.O.),967,"But around six-thirty in the morning
when he finished his day -"
968,ACE (V.O.),968,"- no matter where he was or what he
was doing, he always went home to
make breakfast for his son, Nicky-
Boy."
969,NICKY,969,"Here, let's put a little of this on
for you. I know you like this. A
little butter, right, not a lot?"
970,LITTLE NICKY,970,Mm-hm.
971,NICKY,971,"You know why, right?"
972,LITTLE NICKY,972,Yeah.
973,NICKY,973,Why?
974,LITTLE NICKY,974,'Cause it clogs up your heart.
975,NICKY,975,What a smart kid you are!
976,NICKY,976,"Okay, eat."
977,NICKY (V.O.),977,"Every couple of weeks I used to send
Marino back to the bosses with a
piece of what I made."
978,NICKY (V.O.),978,"Not a big piece, but fuck them, what
did they know? They were fifteen
hundred miles away..."
979,NICKY (V.O.),979,"...and I don't know anybody who can
see that far. Their drop was a truck
stop/garage where..."
980,NICKY (V.O.),980,"...Remo and the guys used to hang
out and count their millions."
981,MARINO,981,Remo.
982,GAGGI,982,"Hey, Frankie."
983,MARINO,983,How are you?
984,GAGGI,984,"Fine, fine."
985,NICKY (V.O.),985,"I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't
give a fuck. I mean, you know, they
all worked it out together."
986,MARINO,986,Nicky sends his warmest regards.
987,GAGGI,987,Uh-huh. Good.
988,NICKY (V.O.),988,"But I knew how to keep the bosses
happy. Whenever they gave me little
jobs to do, you know, to send a
message, I would carry things out..."
989,GAGGI,989,And how are things going down there?
990,MARINO,990,Fine. Everything's goin' good.
991,NICKY (V.O.),991,"...to a tee. Like the time Tony
Dogs..."
992,NICKY (V.O.),992,"...who was supposed to be the new
maniac tough guy in town, shot up
one of Remo's bars. Here's a fuckin'
guy, kills two of Remo's guys and a
poor fuckin' waitress, who was just
workin' on her night off, of all
things."
993,NICKY (V.O.),993,"I mean, this guy's just beggin' to
be made an example of."
994,GAGGI (V.O.),994,Frankie...
995,GAGGI,995,"...I want all the names of all the
other people he had with him. And I
don't care what you have to do to
him to get 'em. You understand?"
996,MARINO,996,"I'll take care of it, Remo."
997,GAGGI,997,"E mo va! [Italian-American slang for
'Now, go!']"
998,NICKY (V.O.),998,"To be truthful with you, I had to
admire this fuckin' guy.  He was one
of the toughest Irishmen I ever met."
999,NICKY,999,"This fuckin' guy, he got some stamina,
don't he?"
1000,NICKY (V.O.),1000,This son-of-a-bitch was tough.
1001,NICKY,1001,"Personally, I don't give a fuck who
was with him anyway. As long as he
gives me a name I could give to them."
1002,NICKY (V.O.),1002,"For two days and two fuckin' nights,
we beat the shit out of this guy. I
mean, we even stuck ice-picks in his
balls."
1003,NICKY,1003,"You better hope he gives me a fuckin'
name soon, or I'm gonna give him
yours, Frank."
1004,MARINO,1004,"Yeah, thanks a lot."
1005,NICKY (V.O.),1005,But he never talked.
1006,NICKY,1006,I know you would have ratted by now.
1007,NICKY (V.O.),1007,"In the end, I had to put his fuckin'
head in a vise."
1008,NICKY,1008,"Dogs. Dogs, can your hear me, Dogs?"
1009,NICKY,1009,"Listen to me, Anthony. I got your
head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna
squash your fuckin' head like a
grapefruit if you don't give me a
name. Don't make me have to do this,
please. Come on. Don't make me be a
bad guy. Come on."
1010,TONY DOGS,1010,Fuck you!
1011,NICKY,1011,"This motherfucker, do you believe
this? Two fuckin' days and nights!"
1012,NICKY,1012,Fuck me?
1013,NICKY,1013,"Fuck me, you motherfucker?"
1014,NICKY,1014,"Fuck my mother? That's what you
fuckin' tell me?"
1015,NICKY,1015,"Huh? You motherfucker, you, huh?"
1016,NICKY,1016,"Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!"
1017,TONY DOGS,1017,Ch-Charlie M!
1018,NICKY,1018,Charlie M?
1019,TONY DOGS,1019,Charlie M.
1020,NICKY,1020,"Charlie M? You make me pop your
fuckin' eye out of your head to
protect that piece of shit? Charlie
M? You dumb motherfucker!"
1021,TONY DOGS,1021,"Kill me, you fuck, kill me."
1022,NICKY,1022,"Kill you,"
1023,NICKY,1023,You motherfucker you!
1024,NICKY,1024,"Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor."
1025,ACE (V.O.),1025,The word got around that finally...
1026,ACE (V.O.),1026,"...there was a real gangster in town.
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas."
1027,NICKY,1027,Charlie M!
1028,ACE,1028,"Four reels, sevens across, three
fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do
you have any idea what the odds are?"
1029,WARD,1029,"Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions,
maybe more."
1030,ACE,1030,"Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty
minutes? Why didn't you pull the
machines? Why didn't you call me?"
1031,WARD,1031,"Well, it happened so quick. Three
guys won. I didn't have a chance to
call you."
1032,ACE,1032,"You didn't see the scam? You didn't
see what was goin' on?"
1033,WARD,1033,"Well, there's no way to determine
that, Sam."
1034,ACE,1034,"Yes, there is. An infallible way!
They won!"
1035,WARD,1035,"Well, it's a casino. People gotta
win sometimes."
1036,ACE,1036,"Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off.
Now, you're insulting my intelligence.
What do you think, I'm a fuckin'
idiot? You know goddamn well somebody
had to get into those machines and
set those fuckin' reels."
1037,ACE,1037,"The probability on one-four-reel
machine is a million and a half to
one. On three machines in a row,
it's in the billions.  It cannot
happen... would not happen, you
fuckin' momo! What's the matter with
you!  Didn't you see you were bein'
set up on the second win?"
1038,WARD,1038,I really think you're -
1039,ACE,1039,"You - Wait! You didn't see that you
were being set up on the second win?"
1040,WARD,1040,"I really think you're overreacting
in this whole -"
1041,ACE,1041,"Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had
it with you. I've been carryin' your
ass in this place ever since I got
here. Get your ass and get your things
and get out of here."
1042,WARD,1042,You're firin' me?
1043,ACE,1043,"I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'"
1044,ACE,1044,"I'm firin' you, you -"
1045,WARD,1045,"You might regret this, Mr Rothstein."
1046,ACE,1046,"I'll regret it even more if I keep
you on."
1047,WARD,1047,This is not the way to treat people.
1048,ACE,1048,"Listen, if you didn't know you're
bein' scammed, you're too fuckin'
dumb to keep this job. If you did
know, you were in on it. Either way,
you're out!  Get out! Go on."
1049,ACE,1049,Let's go.
1050,ACE,1050,"I mean, the guy is history as far as
I'm concerned. History."
1051,GREEN,1051,"But you can't just fire him. Webb's
his brother-in-law. He's County
Commissioner."
1052,ACE,1052,"So what? Everybody out here with
cowboy boots is a fuckin' county
commissioner or related to a county
commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of
it."
1053,GREEN,1053,"This is his state. His uncle's Chief
Judge. His brother-in-law runs the
County Commission. I don't know how
many other relatives he's got in
town.  There's gotta be a way to
work him back in."
1054,ACE,1054,"Phil, I can understand. You're in
the finances, you're upstairs, but
you are not on the floor. I got
thousands of players. I got five
hundred dealers.  They're all lookin'
to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a
day. I have to let them know I'm
watching all the details, all the
time; that there is not one single
thing I will not catch as I am over
here."
1055,ACE,1055,Look at yours.
1056,GREEN,1056,What?
1057,ACE,1057,"Look at that. Look at this. There's
nothin'... look how many blueberries
your muffin has and how many mine
has. Yours is falling apart. I have
nothing."
1058,GREEN,1058,What are you talking about?
1059,ACE,1059,"It's like everything else in this
place. You don't do it yourself, it
never gets done."
1060,GREEN,1060,Where you goin'?
1061,ACE,1061,"From now on I want you to put an
equal amount of blueberries in each
muffin. An equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin."
1062,BAKER,1062,"You know how long that's going to
take?"
1063,ACE,1063,"I don't care how long it takes. Put
an equal amount in each muffin."
1064,ACE,1064,"Come on, honey, just a little. That
a girl, that a girl. Oh, boy, look."
1065,ACE,1065,"Okay, want to go with Mommy?"
1066,ACE,1066,What do you need?
1067,GINGER,1067,You get her?  Okay.
1068,GINGER,1068,"Well, I need a lot. I need more than
usual."
1069,ACE,1069,"Well, why don't you take it out of
your account? There's a lot there."
1070,GINGER,1070,"Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's
just that... well, I need more than
that. I need twenty-five thousand."
1071,ACE,1071,Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
1072,GINGER,1072,Yeah.
1073,ACE,1073,Why do you need that much?
1074,GINGER,1074,"Well, what's the difference? I just
need it."
1075,ACE,1075,"Well, I mean... you know, I gotta
ask you. That's a lot of money.
You're not asking for a box of
popcorn, you know. I mean..."
1076,GINGER,1076,"I'm aware of that. We don't have to
turn this into a big deal."
1077,GINGER,1077,"Okay? We don't have to have a fight.
It was important to me. But forget
it. Just something I wanted to do
for myself."
1078,ACE,1078,"Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you
know, tell me what it's for."
1079,ACE,1079,Why can't you tell me what it's for?
1080,ACE,1080,Huh?
1081,ACE,1081,"Well, you know what? Now, I want you
to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to
me and asks me for twenty-five
thousand. I mean, what do you want?
Do you want a coat?"
1082,GINGER,1082,No.
1083,ACE,1083,"Well, if you want a coat, you got
it. You know that. It's not the money,
it's just why do you want it?  That's
all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to
that?"
1084,GINGER,1084,"Look - Sam, I've been independent my
whole life. I never had to ask anybody
for anything. Now you're making me
beg you for this."
1085,ACE,1085,What are you talkin' a- ?
1086,GINGER,1086,"Okay? And you're embarrassing me.
Why do want to make me feel so bad?"
1087,ACE,1087,"You're askin' me for twenty-five
thousand. I'm not out to make you
feel bad. I want to just be able to
trust you. You now, it's about trust.
I have to be able to trust you with
my life. Do you understand? Can I
trust you?"
1088,ACE,1088,"Can I trust you?... Can I trust
you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?"
1089,GINGER,1089,You can trust me.
1090,ACE,1090,"Good, so then you could tell me what
the money is for."
1091,NICKY,1091,"Yeah, she's leavin' the bank now.
All right, I'm gonna follow her."
1092,LESTER,1092,"What does that mean? No, I know that
look. What does that mean?"
1093,GINGER,1093,It means I got the money.
1094,LESTER,1094,"You got money. That's a - That's a
good look."
1095,ACE,1095,"How you doin', Les? It's Lester,
right? Sam."
1096,ACE,1096,"From my recollection, aren't you the
card shark... the golf hustler...
the pimp from Beverly Hills?"
1097,ACE,1097,"If I'm wrong, please correct me,
'cause I never knew you to be a heist
man."
1098,ACE,1098,"But if you are, you know what...
here, take mine too."
1099,ACE,1099,"Go ahead, take it. 'Cause you already
have hers."
1100,ACE,1100,She's my wife.
1101,ACE,1101,"Look at me. You did know that, didn't
you? You knew that she's my wife?
Huh? Hey, look at me."
1102,LESTER,1102,"Yeah, yeah. I know that."
1103,ACE,1103,"You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come
back again... ever... to take her
money... next time bring a pistol.
That way you got a chance. Be a man,
don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you
want to do me a favor? Get out of
here. I want to be alone with my
wife. Get the fuck up and get out of
here."
1104,LESTER,1104,Okay.
1105,ACE,1105,You fuckin' piece of shit.
1106,LESTER,1106,"Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's
bullshit. You know, you know, what
the fuck?"
1107,ACE,1107,"You remember when you called him
that night? When you said goodbye to
him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get
married, I'll be right down, we'll
get married.'  He didn't say that to
you, did he?"
1108,GINGER,1108,"No, he didn't."
1109,ACE,1109,"Didn't. No, instead, what did he
say? 'Fuck him. Take him for
everything he's got.'"
1110,ACE,1110,"Come here, I want to show you
somethin'."
1111,HOOD #1,1111,You fuckin' shit.
1112,GINGER,1112,No! No! No! Don't!
1113,GINGER,1113,Make them stop it!
1114,GINGER,1114,"No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's
my fault!"
1115,GINGER,1115,No! No!
1116,LESTER,1116,Fuck!
1117,LESTER,1117,Fuck you!
1118,HOOD #2,1118,You piece of shit.
1119,LESTER,1119,"Couldn't do it yourself, you
chickenshit cocksucker!"
1120,GINGER,1120,"He's such a prick. He had some guy
from the hotel beat him up. He didn't
want to do it himself. Oh, no, he
didn't want to get his own hands
dirty."
1121,GINGER,1121,"So, why'd he have to do that, huh?"
1122,GINGER,1122,Tell me.
1123,NICKY,1123,"I know it wasn't a nice thing to do
but -"
1124,GINGER,1124,"Yeah, no shit."
1125,NICKY,1125,"Well, you gotta understand it. He
doesn't know if this guy is shaking
you down or taking advantage of you."
1126,GINGER,1126,"No! No! I told him all about the guy
before we ever got married. This is
no fuckin' surprise."
1127,NICKY,1127,"Oh, you did? I didn't know that."
1128,GINGER,1128,"Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I
was trying to help, so... so what?"
1129,NICKY,1129,"You know... the first time I ever
saw your guys together... I never
saw him so happy. I mean, I know
he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything,
but..."
1130,NICKY,1130,"I never see - You know, I never seen
him act like that with anybody else.
I think he's crazy about you. I mean,
he really loves you. He does."
1131,GINGER,1131,"Oh, come on. I went into this with
my eyes open, you know. I knew the
bottom could drop out at any time.
I'm a working girl, right?  You don't
think I'm gonna go into a situation
like this if I don't think I'm gonna
get covered on the back end."
1132,NICKY,1132,Sure.
1133,GINGER,1133,Am I right?
1134,NICKY,1134,I can see that. Sure.
1135,GINGER,1135,"So, he put aside some jewelry for
me. A lot of jewelry."
1136,NICKY,1136,"You mean, like a lot of expensive
jewelry? About how much?"
1137,GINGER,1137,"Mm, you want to steal it?"
1138,NICKY,1138,"No. I - I'm just curious, you know.
I was wonderin' how much he would
put into a thing like that. That's
all."
1139,GINGER,1139,"I'm told it's worth about a million
dollars, maybe more."
1140,NICKY,1140,"Well, there you go. But what does
that tell ya? A million dollars in
jewelry. Does that tell you the guy
is crazy about you, or what?"
1141,GINGER,1141,"I should have never married him.
He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini...
duality."
1142,GINGER,1142,"Gemini's the snake. You know you
can't trust the snake."
1143,GINGER,1143,I mean it.
1144,NICKY,1144,I know what you mean.
1145,NICKY,1145,"Listen, Ginger... you know, this is
probably not... I don't have the
answers anyway... and this is probably
not what you want to hear right now,
because you're a little upset with
Ace."
1146,GINGER,1146,I do.
1147,NICKY,1147,"I understand that. But, you know, I
think you should try to make the
best of it now. Go slow, you know.
See what happens."
1148,GINGER,1148,"He could have killed him! Okay? He
could have killed him."
1149,GINGER,1149,"He didn't have to hit him. It's not
exactly like I'm sleepin' with the
guy! And he makes me sneak around to
see my own friends! What the fuck is
that all about?"
1150,NICKY,1150,"Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves
you so much. He's jealous and worried."
1151,GINGER,1151,He gives a fuck what I do?
1152,NICKY,1152,"Look, I'll try to find out what the
hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll
talk to him."
1153,GINGER,1153,Okay.
1154,NICKY,1154,All right?
1155,GINGER,1155,Yeah.
1156,GINGER,1156,Thanks.
1157,GINGER,1157,Thanks for puttin' up with me.
1158,NICKY,1158,"And take it easy with this shit,
will you? I mean, this can only make
matters worse."
1159,GINGER,1159,"Oh, come on."
1160,NICKY,1160,"You're a beautiful girl. You don't
want to ruin your looks. I've seen a
lot of girls get shot to hell from
this stuff."
1161,GINGER,1161,You're so nice.
1162,NICKY,1162,"Come on, now, I don't want to see
you unhappy."
1163,GINGER,1163,Thanks.
1164,NICKY,1164,Yeah.
1165,GINGER,1165,Thank you.
1166,NICKY,1166,It's all right.
1167,SECRETARY,1167,"Mr Rothstein? County Commissioner
Pat Webb is here to see you."
1168,ACE,1168,Okay...
1169,ACE,1169,...give me a minute.
1170,SECRETARY,1170,Okay.
1171,SECRETARY,1171,It'll just be a minute.
1172,SECRETARY,1172,Mr Webb...  Can I get you anything?
1173,WEBB,1173,"Oh, no."
1174,WEBB,1174,"No, thank you, little lady."
1175,ACE,1175,"Okay, send him in and call me four
minutes after."
1176,WEBB,1176,Mr Rothstein...
1177,WEBB,1177,I'm Pat Webb.
1178,ACE,1178,How do you do?
1179,WEBB,1179,"Hey, it is my pleasure."
1180,ACE,1180,"Yeah, I heard a lot about you."
1181,WEBB,1181,"Oh, thank you, sir."
1182,WEBB,1182,"Hey, house is doin' well."
1183,WEBB,1183,"Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I
appreciate you takin' the time to
see a poor ol' civil servant."
1184,ACE,1184,"No, that's quite all right."
1185,ACE,1185,Why don't you have a seat?
1186,WEBB,1186,"Hm? Oh. Thank you, sir."
1187,WEBB,1187,"Uh, I come here personally to kind
of smooth over a fracas about a
certain matter. See, uh, maybe you
didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is
a very well-liked man in this town.
He's got lots of friends here. Now,
his family and their money go back
many, many years. Now, friends vote...
family and money votes. That's
important to me... and you. And if
you'll think about our little problem
along them lines...  and you forgive
me for sayin' it, maybe he did not
deserve to be fired."
1188,ACE,1188,"I'm sorry, but he knew about our
gettin' hit on three big machines in
a row and he did nothing about it.
That means either he was in on it
or, forgive me for saying this, he
was too dumb to see what was going
on. Either way, I cannot have a man
like that workin' here."
1189,WEBB,1189,"Before we point the dirty end of the
stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be
sure we can prove them charges."
1190,ACE,1190,"Believe me, if I could prove it, he
would be under arrest."
1191,WEBB,1191,"Are, uh -"
1192,WEBB,1192,"- are we certain that you want the
Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your
record and your gangster pals like
Nicky Santoro?"
1193,ACE,1193,"I think you're way out of line talkin'
to me like that. What you're sayin'
is libelous, and you're in no position
to challenge my expertise. I went
way out of my way to be very helpful
and courteous to that kid. He's weak,
he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the
whole place. There's not much more I
can do for him."
1194,WEBB,1194,"You have got me there. Old Don is as
useless as tits on a boar."
1195,WEBB,1195,"But, he is my brother-in-law, and I
would look on it as a personal favor
if you'd think some more on hirin'
him back."
1196,ACE,1196,"I can't do that. And I appreciate
the fact that he's your brother-in-
law, and I do want to help you and I
like to do favors, and I know who
you are, but I cannot do that."
1197,WEBB,1197,"Well, could there be any position...
further down the trough?"
1198,ACE,1198,"I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's
too incompetent. And the bottom line
is, he cannot be trusted."
1199,ACE,1199,"Okay, thanks."
1200,ACE,1200,"Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry."
1201,WEBB,1201,"Mr Rothstein. Your people never will
understand the way it works out here.
You're all just our guests. But you
act like you're at home. Let me tell
you somethin', partner... you ain't
home. But that's where we're gonna
send you if it harelips the Governor."
1202,WEBB,1202,Thank you for your time.
1203,ACE,1203,No problem.
1204,ACE,1204,Sorry.
1205,WEBB,1205,You bet.
1206,ACE,1206,What happened to my pills?
1207,GINGER,1207,Huh?
1208,ACE,1208,"Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin'
too much, you're takin' all my pills
too?"
1209,GINGER,1209,I didn't take your pills.
1210,ACE,1210,"Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a
one of these, a half a one of these.
And that's when I have extreme pain.
I had a three-month supply. What'd
you do with 'em?"
1211,GINGER,1211,You didn't have to beat him up!
1212,ACE,1212,What?
1213,GINGER,1213,"I was just tryin' to help him. It's
not like I'm sleeping with the guy!"
1214,ACE,1214,"Yeah, how do I know?"
1215,GINGER,1215,You can't make me stop caring...
1216,ACE,1216,What? What?!
1217,GINGER,1217,"I said, you can't make me stop caring
about people."
1218,ACE,1218,Listen.
1219,ACE,1219,"Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best
of everything here, you know?  I
mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes.
Uh, I mean... people look up to you
in this town. I don't know what to
think -"
1220,GINGER,1220,"You know what, Ace? I don't give a
shit! I'm gettin' out of here."
1221,GINGER,1221,I am.
1222,ACE,1222,It's okay.  Look...
1223,ACE,1223,...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
1224,GINGER,1224,Okay.
1225,ACE,1225,"If not for me, at least for Amy."
1226,GINGER,1226,"Okay, okay."
1227,ACE,1227,"You understand? Your drinking's
gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna
get you into a program. They got
plenty of good ones."
1228,GINGER,1228,I don't need one.
1229,ACE,1229,"Yes, you do. It's very discreet.
There's no names in the papers. You
don't have to worry about any of
that stuff."
1230,GINGER,1230,That's all you care about.
1231,GINGER,1231,You don't care about me at all.
1232,ACE,1232,"Yes, I - yes, I do."
1233,GINGER,1233,"No, you don't."
1234,ACE,1234,"How could you say that?  You're a
beautiful woman. You're destroying
yourself. You don't need that stuff.
You don't need that fuckin' leech
livin' off you. I know you better
than you know yourself. You're a
tiger, you're stronger than I am.
And when you set your mind on doing
something, you do it better than
anybody."
1235,ACE,1235,You can do it.
1236,ACE,1236,You can do it.
1237,GINGER,1237,"Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay...
I'll try. I'll try."
1238,GINGER,1238,"I'll try. I will. Don't be mad at
me, okay... I will."
1239,NICKY (V.O.),1239,"No matter what the problems were
outside the count room, it was all
worth it. The cash kept rollin' in.
And the..."
1240,NICKY (V.O.),1240,"...suitcases kept comin' and goin'.
And let me tell ya, the fuckin' bottom
line here is... cash."
1241,NICKY (V.O.),1241,"The only problem was that, after a
while, the bosses noticed that the
suitcases were gettin' a little light."
1242,BORELLI,1242,"Aspett'. [Italian-American slang for
'Wait'] Wait a minute. You mean to
tell me that the money we're robbing
is bein' robbed? That somebody's
robbing from us?  We go through all
this fuckin' trouble, and somebody's
robbin' us?"
1243,GAGGI,1243,Eh?
1244,NANCE,1244,"Like I said, you know, i-it's part
of the business. I-it's considered
leakage."
1245,BORELLI,1245,"Leakage, my balls. I want the guy
who's robbin' us."
1246,NICKY (V.O.),1246,"Even John Nance, that's the guy who
ran the skim, he knew there wasn't
much you could do about it. You gotta
know that a guy who helps you steal,
even if you take care of him real
well, I mean, he's gonna steal a
little bit extra for himself. Makes
sense, don't it? Right? Well, you go
try and make these hard-headed old
greaseballs understand that."
1247,BORELLI,1247,"What's the point of skimming if we're
being skimmed? Defeats the whole
purpose of what we're doin' out there."
1248,GAGGI,1248,Huh?
1249,NANCE,1249,"You know, they take this money because
they're my guys. So you gotta give
'em some leeway."
1250,NICKY (V.O.),1250,"But the bosses never believed in
leeway, so listen to what they do:
they..."
1251,NICKY (V.O.),1251,"...put Artie Piscano, the underboss
of KC, in charge of making sure nobody
skimmed the skim."
1252,BORELLI,1252,"What the hell have you been doin'
out there?"
1253,PISCANO,1253,"I was out there with my cumma [Italian-
American slang for 'girlfriend'.]"
1254,BORELLI,1254,"Your cumma? What are you doin' with
your cumma?"
1255,PISCANO,1255,"What else? I gave her a schaff
[Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]"
1256,NICKY (V.O.),1256,"The only trouble was, Piscano was a
disaster. This guy could fuck up a
cup of coffee."
1257,BORELLI,1257,"Artie, what the hell have you been
doin' out there, Artie?"
1258,PISCANO,1258,I'm out there more than I'm here.
1259,NICKY (V.O.),1259,"And little did anybody know where
this would all lead. If they did,
they would have been better off makin'
fuckin' novenas."
1260,BORELLI,1260,"You gotta go back there and talk to
that guy."
1261,PISCANO,1261,"Come on, go back there? I never got
paid my expenses for the last trip."
1262,BORELLI,1262,What expenses?
1263,PISCANO,1263,"Well, I'm goin' all over, layin'
money out of my own pocket, and I
never get anything back. What the
hell's goin' on?"
1264,BORELLI,1264,You gotta go back out there.
1265,PISCANO,1265,"Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna
start keepin' records."
1266,BORELLI,1266,"Artie, no records, Artie. What are
you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?"
1267,PISCANO,1267,"Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin'
dough for these trips and nothin'
ever comes back. I mean, what hell's
goin' on? What are we doin' over
here?"
1268,BORELLI,1268,"You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're
havin' a good time at my expense.
What the fuck? I mean, after all,
you're the one having a good time,
not me."
1269,ACE (V.O.),1269,"No matter how many novenas you could
make, nothin'..."
1270,ACE (V.O.),1270,"...was gonna stop what came up next
at the casino."
1271,GREEN,1271,I can't believe you're doing this.
1272,SCOTT,1272,"We made a deal. You came to me,
remember?"
1273,GREEN,1273,"Yes, I appreciated your advice..."
1274,ACE (V.O.),1274,"It turned out Phil Green, Mr
Integrity, had a partner nobody knew
about... and when she showed up and
started demanding some money from
the Tangiers..."
1275,GREEN,1275,Why are you doing this to me?
1276,SCOTT,1276,Because you're wrong.
1277,GREEN,1277,I'm not wrong.
1278,SCOTT,1278,"Yes, you are."
1279,GREEN,1279,"No, I am not wrong."
1280,ACE (V.O.),1280,...Green tried to stonewall her.
1281,SCOTT,1281,"And you're not going to get away
with this! I will see to it that you
do not get away with this!"
1282,ACE (V.O.),1282,So...
1283,ACE (V.O.),1283,...she sued him in court.
1284,JUDGE,1284,"The court will now hear the matter
of the plaintiff, Anna Scott, against
Tangiers Corporation and its
president, Philip Green."
1285,LAWYER #1,1285,"Good morning, your Honor. John Momet
on behalf of Mr Green."
1286,LAWYER #2,1286,"Mitchell Logan on behalf of Anna
Scott, your Honor."
1287,JUDGE,1287,"Mr Logan, you may proceed."
1288,LAWYER #2,1288,"Thank you, Judge."
1289,SCOTT,1289,"I believe he was absolutely fair and
I'm delighted with the decision."
1290,NANCE,1290,We got a problem.
1291,NANCE,1291,It didn't go too well.
1292,NANCE,1292,"Green has to open up the books...
has to show how he got the financing.
And, hey, that's - that's not good."
1293,GAGGI,1293,Shit.
1294,NICKY (V.O.),1294,"She was doin' pretty good with her
lawsuit, but before she could start
countin' her money, the boys back
home decided to settle the case out
of court instead."
1295,NICKY (V.O.),1295,"So, they send me."
1296,REPORTER #1,1296,"Can you comment on the murder of
Anna Scott?"
1297,GREEN,1297,What are you talking about?
1298,REPORTER #1 (O.S.),1298,"She was found last night, shot in
the head."
1299,REPORTER #2 (O.S.),1299,"Was this just a real-estate
partnership?"
1300,REPORTER #3 (O.S.),1300,Her lawyer said you were partners.
1301,GREEN,1301,"We were - We were involved in minor
real estate deals many years ago.
It was never a partnership."
1302,REPORTER #1,1302,"Police are calling this a mob-style
killing."
1303,REPORTER #2,1303,"Did you ever hear of the twenty-two-
caliber killer?"
1304,GREEN,1304,"I'm a little in shock, quite
frankly..."
1305,ACE (V.O.),1305,"Now, instead of the cops only lookin'
at Nicky, they started looking at
Green too. And he was supposed to be
our squeaky..."
1306,ACE (V.O.),1306,"...clean front man. So, I had to
start giving interviews to make sure
everybody knew the casino was on the
up and up."
1307,REPORTER,1307,"So, actually, how often do you really
fill in for him?"
1308,SHERBERT,1308,"Green's here about two or three times
a month, and he's busy -"
1309,SHERBERT,1309,"- with other real-estate deals and -
and things, you know."
1310,REPORTER,1310,"So, in Green's absence, then, you're
the boss."
1311,ACE,1311,"I serve at the pleasure of the
chairman of the board and... my, uh,
responsibilities are to run the day-
to-day operations."
1312,REPORTER,1312,"So, day-to-day, then, you're the
boss?"
1313,ACE,1313,"Well, in a sense, you could say
that... I am the boss, when Mr Green
is away. You could say that."
1314,WEBB (O.S.),1314,Hm. Have you read this?
1315,WEBB (O.S.),1315,Hm? It's 'bout Mr Rothstein.
1316,WEBB,1316,It says
1317,WEBB,1317,"'The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties
says that he is the real boss of the
new hundred-million-dollar Tangiers
Casino empire.'"
1318,WEBB,1318,You believe that?
1319,DUPREY,1319,Did he really say that?
1320,WEBB,1320,"Why, of course, he really said that.
It's right here. Has that man even
filed for his license yet?"
1321,AUSTIN,1321,"I don't know. We'll have to check
the files."
1322,WEBB,1322,"Well, without gettin' your shorts in
a knot, would you do that? And kinda
check closely, 'cause we may have to
kick a kike's ass out of town.  Thank
you."
1323,NEWSCASTER,1323,"A Gaming Control Board investigation
of Tangiers executive Sam Rothstein's
application for a (photo of ACE)

1331,SUPER SUBTITLE,1331,'I don't want a meeting at my house.'
1332,NICKY,1332,"No, no it's okay."
1333,ACE,1333,"It's impossible. It's booked up, and
you gotta make a reservation.  It's..."
1334,ACE,1334,...very difficult to get in.

Casino boss Sam 'Ace' Rothstein is
heating up. Tonight, an up-to-the-
minute look at Ace Rothstein's attempt
to get state licensing despite law
enforcement allegations of Rothstein's
organized crime connections. Will
Sam Rothstein's friendship with
alleged organized crime figure Nicky
Santoro keep Rothstein from running
the Tangiers Casino?  And can the
integrity of state gaming laws be
jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?"
1341,ACE,1341,"Why don't you take it easy with that
stuff? Huh?  Come on. Let me help
you. Come on. We're talkin' about
some stuff."
1342,NEWSCASTER,1342,"State officials say 'yes' when that
relationship and those connections
are with anyone as notorious as Nicky
Santoro."

1346,NEWSCASTER,1346,"Promise to be financially secure?
Money Time can help you keep those
promises."
1347,CHARLIE CLARK,1347,"You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry about that stuff."
1348,CHARLIE CLARK (O.S.),1348,It's just a political witch hunt.
1349,NICKY,1349,"Hey, Ace."
1350,ACE,1350,Hey.
1351,ACE,1351,"Want something to drink? Charlie you
want a refill?"
1352,CHARLIE CLARK,1352,"Yeah, refill'd be great."
1353,NICKY,1353,"No, I don't want one."
1354,NICKY,1354,"Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?"
1355,CHARLIE CLARK,1355,Hi. Good.
1356,NICKY,1356,"I've been trying to reach you.
You're tougher to get than the
President."
1357,CHARLIE CLARK,1357,"Well, I've been busy."
1358,NICKY,1358,"Yeah, least you could do is return
my phone calls, though."
1359,CHARLIE CLARK,1359,"Listen... Nicky... we talked about
this... and, uh, I explained to you
that there was the possibility you
might have to take some kind of loss."
1360,NICKY,1360,Yeah.
1361,NICKY,1361,I think I want my money back.
1362,CHARLIE CLARK,1362,What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
1363,NICKY,1363,"You know... I think that you've gotten
the wrong impression about me. I
think in all fairness, I should
explain to you what it is that I do.
For instance, tomorrow morning I'll
get up nice and early, take a walk
down over to the bank and walk in
and see you, and, uh... if you don't
have my money for me, I'll crack
your fuckin' head wide open in front
of everybody in the the bank. And
just about the time that I'm comin'
out of jail, hopefully, you'll be
comin' out of your coma. And guess
what?  I'll split your fuckin' head
open again. Because I'm fuckin'
stupid. I don't give a fuck about
jail.  That's my business. That's
what I do. And we know what you do,
don't we, Charlie? You fuck people
out of money and get away with it."
1364,CHARLIE CLARK,1364,You can't talk to me like...
1365,NICKY,1365,"Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my
fuckin' money to sleep. You go get
my money, or I'll put your fuckin'
brain to sleep."
1366,CHARLIE CLARK,1366,Sam?
1367,NICKY,1367,"Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is
personal."
1368,NICKY,1368,"I'll be there in the morning. You
can fuckin' try me, fatso."
1369,NICKY,1369,You fuckin' try me.
1370,NICKY,1370,You think he got the point?
1371,ACE,1371,"What're you doin'? He's a square
guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat
him like that. He's gonna run to the
FBI."
1372,NICKY,1372,"Fuck the FBI! That prick's been
dodging me for three weeks. And what
is it with you?  All of a sudden,
you're tryin' to tell me what to do
all the time."
1373,ACE,1373,"I'm not tryin' to tell you what to
do. But you were way out of line,
Nick. What're you doin'? Where's
your head?"
1374,NICKY,1374,"Where's my head? Where's your fuckin'
balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to
put somethin' really big together
out here. You know what I'm talkin'
about, huh? You know!  If you're
actin' like this now, how can I depend
on you?  There's a lot of things
gonna change out here. And if you
wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're
gonna have to go my fuckin' way."
1375,ACE,1375,"Listen, Nick, you gotta understand
my situation. I'm responsible for
thousands of people. I got a hundred
million a year goin' through the
place.  It's all over, I'm gonna
tell you, it's all over, if I don't
get that license.  And believe me,
if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go
bad for a lot of people, you
understand?"
1376,NICKY,1376,"Yeah, forget about your fuckin'
license. I plant my own flag out
here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin'
license."
1377,NICKY,1377,"You know, I don't know what it is,
Sammy, but the more I talk to you,
the more I feel like you just don't
wanna go along with me, is that it?"
1378,ACE,1378,"No, I don't wanna come -"
1379,NICKY,1379,You should say so.
1380,ACE,1380,I don't wanna come along with you.
1381,NICKY,1381,Just say so.
1382,ACE,1382,I'll be honest with you.
1383,NICKY,1383,"All right, fine."
1384,ACE,1384,"I don't wanna be involved in anything
you're talkin' about..."
1385,NICKY,1385,Fine.
1386,ACE,1386,"...okay? I just wanna run a square
joint. That's it. I just want my
license. I want everything nice and
quiet. That's it."
1387,NICKY,1387,"You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the
boss.'  That's quiet?"
1388,ACE,1388,"That's all taken out of context.
Okay."
1389,NICKY,1389,"Yeah, that's out of context. Okay."
1390,ACE,1390,"I have no control over that. Ronnie
and Billy were right there. They'll
tell you exactly what happened."
1391,NICKY,1391,"Well, back home they don't know about
fuckin' control. That looks bad."
1392,ACE,1392,"Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what
looks bad."
1393,NICKY,1393,Yeah?
1394,ACE,1394,"Every time you're on television I
get mentioned. That looks bad. That
looks bad."
1395,NICKY,1395,"What the fuck happened to you? Will
you tell me?"
1396,ACE,1396,"What happened to me? What happened
to you?"
1397,NICKY,1397,Yeah.
1398,ACE,1398,You lost your control.
1399,NICKY,1399,I lost control?
1400,ACE,1400,"Yes, you lost your control."
1401,NICKY,1401,"Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin'
around like John Barrymore."
1402,ACE,1402,All right.
1403,NICKY,1403,A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
1404,ACE,1404,All right.
1405,NICKY,1405,"...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I
lost control?!"
1406,ACE,1406,Yeah.
1407,NICKY,1407,"You know, I didn't want to bring
this up, but you have treating a lot
of people with a lot of disrespect.
Even your own wife."
1408,ACE,1408,My wife?
1409,NICKY,1409,Yeah.
1410,ACE,1410,"Now, what does she have to do with
all this?"
1411,NICKY,1411,"Well, she comes to see me. She was
upset about a lot of things,
especially that whole fuckin' Diamond -
that Lester Diamond incident."
1412,ACE,1412,"All of a sudden, you're the shoulder
to cry on? Did you at least tell her
about your little role in that whole
situation?"
1413,NICKY,1413,"No, I didn't. What good would that
do? That's not the fuckin' point."
1414,ACE,1414,"Listen, I would -"
1415,NICKY,1415,"The point is that she's upset. She's -
and you got a fuckin' problem."
1416,ACE,1416,"I - I would appreciate it if you'd
stay out of my personal life, okay?
You wouldn't like it if I did it to
you."
1417,NICKY,1417,"Hey, she came to talk..."
1418,ACE,1418,Please...
1419,NICKY,1419,...to me.
1420,ACE,1420,...don't do it to me...
1421,NICKY,1421,She came to talk to me...
1422,ACE,1422,Okay?
1423,NICKY,1423,"And I - what was I supposed to do,
throw her out?"
1424,ACE,1424,"Ju-just stay away from her. It's
none of your business, okay? There
are certain things you don't do, and
you know that."
1425,NICKY,1425,It's none of my business?
1426,ACE,1426,"That's right, yeah."
1427,NICKY,1427,"A week ago it was my business, now
it's none of my business. In other
words, when you need me to take care
of somethin' for you, then you need
me."
1428,ACE,1428,"Yeah, that's right, the way you need
me to vouch for you as a citizen and
get you out of one of your jams. I'm
gonna have to straighten out what
you just did with this guy."
1429,ACE,1429,This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
1430,NICKY,1430,"Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger
than your casino. That's your problem,
pal."
1431,ACE (V.O.),1431,"I knew what he wanted, and I didn't
want any part of it."
1432,NICKY,1432,"Fuckin' walking around with a big
head. You better check yourself..."
1433,ACE (V.O.),1433,"Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted
to go after Gaggi, go after the skim,
go after everything and everybody."
1434,ACE (V.O.),1434,"Plus, he had stopped askin' permission
from back home for every little thing."
1435,ACE (V.O.),1435,"A casino boss and his wife were
killed. The bulls questioned Nicky."
1436,ACE (V.O.),1436,"A dealer from the Sirocco... they
questioned Nicky."
1437,ACE (V.O.),1437,"A bunch of stool pigeons wound in
the trunks of their cars... they
questioned Nicky."
1438,ACE (V.O.),1438,A lawyer... they questioned Nicky.
1439,ACE (V.O.),1439,"And when some guys who didn't pay
their Shylocks began disappearing,
Nicky's name was in every one of
those newspapers."
1440,ACE (V.O.),1440,"Nicky was questioned in two dozen
murders, but they always had to let
him go. There were never any
witnesses."
1441,NICKY (V.O.),1441,"The coppers blamed me for everything
that went wrong out here, and I mean
every little fuckin' thing too."
1442,NICKY,1442,"Watch yourself. You're gonna get
runned over there."
1443,NICKY (V.O.),1443,"If a guy fuckin' tripped over a
fuckin' banana peel, they'd bring me
in for it."
1444,NICKY,1444,"Come on, huh. That's enough now. Be
nice, huh? Be nice."
1445,NICKY (V.O.),1445,"And the bosses were no better. I
mean, they complained day and night
because things don't run smooth.
Well, in my line of work, things
don't run so smooth, I'm sorry. I
mean, I'm dealing with degenerate
animals out here. But the bosses,
what do they give a fuck? They're
sittin' on their asses, drinkin'
anisette. Meanwhile, I'm the guy in
the trenches. Fuckin' bosses, they
think it's a fuckin' free lunch out
here."
1446,GAGGI,1446,"Frankie... they found a guy's head
in the desert. Do you know about
that?"
1447,MARINO,1447,"Yeah, I heard, yeah."
1448,GAGGI,1448,"Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it.
They're makin' a big deal out of it."
1449,MARINO,1449,I know.
1450,GAGGI,1450,It's in all the papers.
1451,MARINO,1451,What're you gonna do?
1452,GAGGI,1452,And I mean... that's no good.
1453,MARINO,1453,I know.
1454,GAGGI,1454,"You gotta tell him... to take care
of things a little better."
1455,MARINO,1455,"I'll tell him, Remo."
1456,NICKY (V.O.),1456,Fuckin'...
1457,NICKY (V.O.),1457,"...bosses. I mean, they're smokin'
their Di Nobilis and they're eatin'
a trippa [Italian-American slang for
'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you
know, fried pigs guts? While, if I
wanna talk private, I gotta go to a
fuckin' bus stop."
1458,NICKY,1458,"But, hey, what do they care, as long
as I keep sendin' money back."
1459,MARINO,1459,"Yeah, but they're complaining."
1460,NICKY,1460,"Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's
here."
1461,NICKY,1461,"I do all the work. Somebody don't
like it, fuck him."
1462,MARINO,1462,It's up to you.
1463,NICKY,1463,"They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready."
1464,NICKY,1464,"I know one thing. All I gotta do is
take care of four or five of those
fuckin' guys, the rest will fall
right into place. Believe me."
1465,NICKY (V.O.),1465,"Peekaboo, you fucks, you."
1466,NICKY,1466,"I see you, you motherfuckers."
1467,ACE (V.O.),1467,"The problem was, Nicky was not only
bringin' heat on himself, but on me
too. The FBI watched every move he
made. But he didn't care. He just
didn't care."
1468,NICKY (V.O.),1468,"If they're gonna watch me, fuck 'em,
I'm gonna watch 'em right back. I
spent a few dollars. Top dollar, who
gives a shit?"
1469,NICKY (V.O.),1469,"I got the latest anti-buggin'
equipment from the same places that
sell to the fuckin' CIA. I had all
the special police frequency radios,
FBI descramblers, cameras that see
in the dark, and because of that,
the miserable sons-of-bitches that
they are, they never once caught me
doin' anything I couldn't handle."
1470,ACE (V.O.),1470,I got my job...
1471,ACE (V.O.),1471,"...on the line and this guy's out
havin' the time of his life. He has
every cop in the state watchin' him,
and he's out playin' golf."
1472,NICKY,1472,"Practice enough this week, you prick?"
1473,ACE (V.O.),1473,And at the...
1474,ACE (V.O.),1474,...worst possible time for me.
1475,AUSTIN,1475,A record of the arrests...
1476,ACE (V.O.),1476,"I had my license hearing coming up
and I didn't wanna leave anything to
chance."
1477,ACE,1477,"That was nineteen years ago, and
they were simple gambling pinches."
1478,ACE (V.O.),1478,"I mean, if I can't work in Vegas,
where am I gonna go?"
1479,AUSTIN,1479,"You've been very open with us. I
mean, uh, your books and papers and...
that - that's gonna mean something
when you go before the Commission."
1480,ACE,1480,"Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a
fair hearing."
1481,DUPREY,1481,"Well, this kind of honesty will
guarantee that fair hearing."
1482,ACE,1482,Good.
1483,AUSTIN,1483,"All right, well, we'll move on to -"
1484,AUSTIN (O.S.),1484,"I wanted to hear something about...
Kansas City."
1485,NICKY,1485,"What the fuck is this? Where's this
fuckin' guy gonna land, on the
fairway?"
1486,NICKY,1486,"They're fuckin' agents, Frankie.
Look at this."
1487,ACE (V.O.),1487,"The Feds were watchin' Nicky play
golf for so long, they ran out of
gas. Just what I needed. Right in
front on the Control Board."
1488,NICKY,1488,"A hundred dollars, whoever hits the
plane."
1489,ACE (V.O.),1489,"And, as if things weren't bad
enough..."
1490,ACE (V.O.),1490,"...in comes Piscano, the Kansas City
underboss. He ran that little grocery
store in Kansas City where they
brought the suitcases."
1491,PISCANO,1491,"They're fightin' over those suitcases
again. You know what that means,
right? You know what that means,
right? That means I gotta take another
trip out to Vegas, and it's gonna
cost me another couple of grand."
1492,ACE (V.O.),1492,"He ran it with his brother-in-law,
but mostly what he did was complain,
complain about his trips to Vegas,
to his brother-in-law and to his
mother, all the time."
1493,BROTHER-IN-LAW,1493,"You gotta lay down the law. Otherwise
they're gonna make a fool out of
you."
1494,PISCANO,1494,"They're not gonna make a fool out of
me. I write it all down in this book,"
1495,PISCANO,1495,"every fuckin' nickel that goes down.
Right here, receipts..."
1496,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1496,Hey! Oh!
1497,PISCANO,1497,"Oh, sorry -"
1498,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1498,What's the matter with you?
1499,PISCANO,1499,"Receipts and bills and... everything's
here."
1500,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1500,Since when do you talk like that?
1501,PISCANO,1501,I'm sorry.
1502,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1502,There's a lot of people here.
1503,PISCANO,1503,"Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell
him... screw around with those
suitcases and I'll take the eyes out
of his frickin' head."
1504,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1504,Again!
1505,PISCANO,1505,"I didn't curse. I said 'frickin'
head'."
1506,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1506,That's enough.
1507,PISCANO,1507,I'm sorry.
1508,ACE (V.O.),1508,And what happens next?
1509,ACE (V.O.),1509,"You can't believe it. I mean, who
the hell would believe that the FBI
had a wire in the place lookin' for
some information about some old
homicide about some guy who was
whacked-out, God knows when, over
God knows what?"
1510,PISCANO,1510,"Plus, what's to prevent him with the
suitcases, that he can take what he
wants?  Fuckin' Nance, he brings us
back two suitcases from the Tangiers,
and what about three or four?"
1511,PISCANO,1511,"We got nobody in the room to watch.
That's the law. You know, we can't
even go into the count room to watch
our money? Could you believe this
cowboy bullshit?"
1512,PISCANO,1512,"And sure he's got his people in there.
But how do you know? They could all
be in on it together, those miserable
fucks."
1513,PISCANO,1513,"I'll find out and, if it's Green
himself, I'll bury that bastard."
1514,PISCANO,1514,"I've never trusted him. And you know
I got eyes..."
1515,PISCANO,1515,"...behind my head. They trust that
scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way
I feel, I'll hit the two of them in
the head with a fuckin' shovel."
1516,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1516,"All right, take it easy now, take it
easy."
1517,PISCANO,1517,"Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me
left and right."
1518,PISCANO,1518,"Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset."
1519,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1519,"I know, but that's enough."
1520,PISCANO,1520,"You know - You know - You know what
they're doin' to me?"
1521,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1521,"I know it, I know it."
1522,PISCANO,1522,"I can't take this no more. Back and
forth, back and forth."
1523,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1523,"Take it easy, though."
1524,PISCANO,1524,"All right, all right. But I - I -"
1525,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1525,You'll get a heart attack like that.
1526,PISCANO,1526,"You know, I - I'm too upset right
now. And - An end has to be put to
this."
1527,ACE (V.O.),1527,And the damn...
1528,ACE (V.O.),1528,"...thing is, they go and hear all
this stuff about Las Vegas and the
casinos and the suitcases, and that's
it."
1529,PISCANO (O.S.),1529,"If I have to start handlin' things
the way I..."
1530,PISCANO,1530,"...did years ago, start kickin' ass,
I - I'll do it, and I'll use the
goddamn shovel!  I mean, I..."
1531,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1531,You are right.
1532,PISCANO,1532,"...everything's comin' out of my
pocket. I gotta pay for all these
trips back and forth, back and forth."
1533,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1533,You are right. What can I...
1534,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1534,...tell you.
1535,ACE (V.O.),1535,"Would you believe that such a thing
could happen?"
1536,PISCANO,1536,"I'm in this to make money, not to
lose money.  And..."
1537,ACE (V.O.),1537,"Every FBI man across the country had
their ears open now."
1538,PISCANO,1538,Because...
1539,PISCANO,1539,...if you want somethin'...
1540,PISCANO,1540,"...done right, you gotta do it
yourself."
1541,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1541,Then do it the way you want.
1542,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1542,What can I tell you?
1543,ACE (V.O.),1543,I mean...
1544,ACE (V.O.),1544,"...Piscano, this guy basically..."
1545,ACE,1545,...sunk the whole world.
1546,PISCANO'S MOTHER,1546,"That's the way people are. There are
some that are good and some that are
bad."
1547,OSCAR,1547,"Mr Chairman and members of the
Commission. Mr Rothstein is pleased
to be here today."
1548,ACE (V.O.),1548,"And when the day finally came, I was
ready. I felt so confident that all
I had to do was present my case."
1549,OSCAR,1549,"...evidence... and we have documents,
one of which is a report by retired
FBI agents, which completely absolves"
1550,OSCAR,1550,"Mr Rothstein from any wrongdoing.
I'd like this marked, please, Mr
Chairman."
1551,SENATOR,1551,"Pardon me, counselor. Before you
continue..."
1552,OSCAR,1552,"No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -"
1553,SENATOR,1553,"...this, uh, this Commission is
prepared to act on a motion denying
the Rothstein application."
1554,OSCAR,1554,Denying?
1555,SENATOR,1555,Do I hear a motion seconded?
1556,OSCAR,1556,Mr. Chairman -
1557,CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #1,1557,"Mr. Chairman, I second the motion."
1558,SENATOR,1558,Do I have a vote on the motion?
1559,OSCAR,1559,Mr. Chairman -
1560,CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #2,1560,Aye.
1561,CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #3,1561,Aye.
1562,CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #4,1562,Aye.
1563,SENATOR,1563,"The ayes have it. This hearing is
adjourned."
1564,ACE,1564,You guys have to be kidding.
1565,ACE,1565,"Adjourned! What do you mean,
adjourned?"
1566,OSCAR,1566,"Mr. Chairman, please."
1567,ACE,1567,Mr. Chairman...
1568,ACE,1568,"Senator, you promised me a hearing."
1569,ACE,1569,"You won't allow me a hearing? You
didn't even look at the FBI reports."
1570,ACE,1570,"When you were my guest, Mr. Chairman,
Senator, at the Tangiers Hotel, did
you not promise me that I would have
a fair hearing -"
1571,SENATOR,1571,"I was never - I was never your guest
at the Tangiers."
1572,ACE,1572,You were never my guest?!
1573,SENATOR,1573,That's right.
1574,ACE,1574,"I never comped you?! I don't comp
you at least two or three times a
month at the Tangiers?!"
1575,SENATOR,1575,"Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer -
answer that at this time."
1576,ACE,1576,Liar.
1577,SENATOR,1577,"Mr Rothstein is being very typical
to this point."
1578,ACE,1578,He's lying.
1579,SENATOR,1579,"The only time I was at the Tangiers
was when I had dinner with Barney
Greenstein."
1580,ACE,1580,Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
1581,SENATOR,1581,You were wandering around.
1582,ACE,1582,Was I at that dinner?
1583,SENATOR,1583,You were wandering around.
1584,ACE,1584,Was I at that dinner?
1585,SENATOR,1585,You were wandering around.
1586,ACE,1586,Was I at that dinner?
1587,SENATOR,1587,"You were in the m- You were in the
building."
1588,ACE,1588,I was in the building!
1589,ACE,1589,"You know damn well I was at that
dinner, and you swore to me that I
would have a fair hearing at that
dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!"
1590,ACE,1590,"Well, tell me I was at least at the
dinner! A-allow me that much."
1591,ACE,1591,Give me that much at least!
1592,SENATOR,1592,"Yes, you were."
1593,ACE,1593,"Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a
liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of-
a"
1594,FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.),1594,"Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige
Novodor."
1595,FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.),1595,"What should have been a routine
licensing hearing turned into bedlam
yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers
Casino executive, Sam"
1596,FEMALE NEWSCASTER,1596,"...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the
state's top gaming officials of
corruption."
1597,ACE,1597,"What are you running for, Bob? What
are you running for?"
1598,FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.),1598,...and hypocrisy.
1599,ACE,1599,"Don't you remember? You promised me
a fair hearing when you were gettin'
comped at my hotel and you were asking
me for copies of your bills so -"
1600,ACE,1600,"- you could put 'em on your expense
account?"
1601,FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.),1601,In a
1602,FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.),1602,"Wild and unprecedented outburst that
followed his gaming license"
1603,FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.),1603,"denial, Rothstein followed several..."
1604,ACE,1604,Bullshit! Bullshit!
1605,FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.),1605,"...stunned commissioners into the
hallway, where he continued his
harangue until his own lawyers and
friends urged him to leave."
1606,ACE,1606,"We all have a past. You have a past,
I have a past. And my past is no
worse than yours. But you guys think
you have the right to pass judgement
on me."
1607,FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.),1607,"Long suspected of running the Tangiers
without..."
1608,ACE,1608,"...twenty years in order to find
nothin' on me -"
1609,ACE,1609,"- unsubstantiated truths on me. And
if you look at your own lives you'd
all be in jail."
1610,FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.),1610,"...a gaming license, yesterday's
hearing was to determine whether
someone with Rothstein's checkered
personal history was qualified to
officially hold the top gaming post."
1611,ACE (V.O.),1611,Fuckin' hypocrites!
1612,GAGGI,1612,What the hell's he gonna do now?
1613,STONE,1613,I don't know
1614,GAGGI,1614,"What's he doin'? He knows all those
guys he yelled at are friends of
ours. What's the matter with him,
making all this mess?"
1615,STONE,1615,"Maybe he could run things with another
job title. Wouldn't be the best,
but, uh, what are we gonna do?"
1616,GAGGI,1616,"However he runs things, it's gotta
be quiet. Let him hide upstairs in
the office. Say he's the janitor, I
don't give a shit. But, please,
whatever job he takes, make sure
it's something quiet."
1617,TRUDY (O.S.),1617,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Tangiers
Hotel proudly presents the all-new
Sam Rothstein Show, Aces High."
1618,TRUDY (O.S.),1618,"Tonight, taped live from the all-new
sportsbook, we present the premiere
showing of Aces High. With the..."
1619,TRUDY,1619,...Sasha Semenoff Orchestra...
1620,TRUDY,1620,...and the Sam Rothstein Dancers.
1621,TRUDY,1621,"Mr Rothstein is a professional gambler
and the best football handicapper..."
1622,TRUDY,1622,"...in American, a man who will take
you inside the real Las Vegas as no
one has ever done before. And now,
ladies and gentlemen, the new..."
1623,TRUDY,1623,"...Entertainment Director of the
Tangiers Hotel Casino: Mr Sam
Rothstein."
1624,ACE,1624,"Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show.
We're very happy to have you here
this evening. The young lady to my
left is Trudy, who is a lead new
dancer in our fabulous show from
Paris."
1625,ACE,1625,"Our first guest this evening... is
Frankie Avalon."
1626,WEBB,1626,Keep an eye on him.
1627,FRANKIE AVALON (O.S.),1627,"...Well, I've got a large family."
1628,ACE,1628,How many kids do you have?
1629,FRANKIE AVALON,1629,"Uh, I'm very proud to say that we
have eight children."
1630,ACE,1630,Eight children!
1631,FRANKIE AVALON,1631,"No, no, no, no, please, please,
please, please, no, please."
1632,ACE,1632,That's amazing.
1633,FRANKIE AVALON,1633,There was nothing to it.
1634,FRANKIE AVALON,1634,It was my pleasure.
1635,GREEN,1635,"Ace, don't do it."
1636,GREEN,1636,"Oh, no, no. No, no. Oh, Jesus...
he's juggling!"
1637,ACE (O.S.),1637,"Let's not take County Commissioner
Pat Webb too seriously."
1638,ACE,1638,"I recently challenged him to a debate
on this program and he declined.
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any
questions. You can ask me anything
you want."
1639,STONE (O.S.),1639,"What the hell is he doin' on
television, anyway?"
1640,STONE,1640,"He's on all night, screamin' about
how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit
all the way to the Supreme Court. He
really must be crazy. He's gonna go
to Washington with this?"
1641,STONE,1641,He's out of his fuckin' mind.
1642,ACE (O.S.),1642,It's a pity in this...
1643,ACE,1643,"...state that we have such hypocrisy.
Some people can do whatever they
want. Other people have to pay through
the nose."
1644,ACE (O.S.),1644,But such is life.
1645,GAGGI,1645,"Andy, go see him. Tell him maybe
it's time he should quit."
1646,ACE,1646,"First of all, what they did was
totally unconstitutional. We're
already on the list to be heard before
the Supreme Court of the United States
later this year."
1647,STONE,1647,"These guys back home don't give a
fuck about the Supreme Court and any
of this bullshit! They want things
to quiet down. They want you to walk
away from -"
1648,ACE,1648,"Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious.
How can I walk away? Don't you see
what's goin' on here? Don't you see
what's at stake?"
1649,STONE,1649,"The old man said, 'Maybe your friend
should give in.'  And when the old
man says 'maybe', that's like a papal
bull. Not only should you quit, you
should run!"
1650,ACE,1650,"Know what my problem is? Every time
they mention my name in the papers,
these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky,
too. How the fuck does that help?  I
mean, the heat he brought down is
murder!  We had a police department
who was cooperative. He's pissed
them off so much now that nobody can
make a move anymore. I mean, what do
you do about that?"
1651,STONE,1651,What do you propose?
1652,ACE,1652,"I don't know, he doesn't listen to
me. Maybe he should...  get lost for
a while. Take a vacation. Would that
be so bad?"
1653,STONE,1653,They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
1654,ACE,1654,"All right, look, if he took a break,
it would just give everybody some
time to maneuver. That's all I'm
saying. It's all that I'm saying."
1655,STONE,1655,"I would forget about the maneuver. I
would just get out."
1656,ACE,1656,I can't do that.
1657,ACE (V.O.),1657,Of course...
1658,JENNIFER,1658,"You know, I don't feel like playin'
tennis."
1659,ACE (V.O.),1659,"...as soon as Andy got back home,
Nicky heard about our talk in the
car."
1660,JENNIFER,1660,"Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go
to the Riviera?"
1661,ACE (V.O.),1661,"Next morning bright and early, I get
the call."
1662,GINGER,1662,One o'clock?
1663,JENNIFER,1663,Great.
1664,GINGER,1664,"You know, I've got to do some shopping
afterwards. Do you want to go?"
1665,JENNIFER,1665,"Well, you know..."
1666,ACE (V.O.),1666,"But just getting a call from Nicky
wasn't easy anymore. Even the codes
didn't work. So, we figured out
another act."
1667,ACE (V.O.),1667,"You see, if a phone's tapped, the
Feds can only listen in..."
1668,ACE (V.O.),1668,"...on the stuff involving crimes. So
on..."
1669,ACE (V.O.),1669,"...routine calls, they have to click
off after a few minutes."
1670,GINGER,1670,"Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin'
elbow."
1671,ACE,1671,Yeah.
1672,NICKY,1672,Meet me at three.
1673,ACE,1673,"What - what, Caesar's?"
1674,NICKY,1674,"No, a..."
1675,NICKY,1675,"...hundred yards further down the
road."
1676,ACE,1676,Why?
1677,NICKY,1677,Don't ask questions. Just be there.
1678,NICKY,1678,Always asking questions.
1679,JENNIFER,1679,Suzy Creamcheese has the exact...
1680,JENNIFER,1680,...same outfit.
1681,GINGER,1681,But I saw something...
1682,GINGER,1682,...something very... cute.
1683,FBI AGENT (O.S.),1683,"Okay, he, uh, he's out. It's the
ant, uh, Brown unit. And he's with,
uh, bogie. I think it's Frankie."
1684,ACE (V.O.),1684,"Nicky started out before me because
it wasn't that easy..."
1685,ACE (V.O.),1685,...for him to get around anymore.
1686,FBI AGENT,1686,"Okay, pulled out..."
1687,FBI AGENT (O.S.),1687,...pretty fast. He's headed upstream.
1688,ACE (V.O.),1688,"Nicky couldn't even go for a ride
without changing..."
1689,ACE (V.O.),1689,"...cars at least six times before he
could shake all his tails."
1690,ACE (V.O.),1690,"And because of all the planes, he
had to use underground garages."
1691,ACE (V.O.),1691,"Meeting in the middle of the desert
always made me nervous."
1692,ACE (V.O.),1692,"Normally, my prospects of comin'
back alive from a meeting with Nicky
were ninety-nine out of a hundred.
But this time, when I heard him say,
'A couple a hundred yards down the
road', I gave myself fifty-fifty."
1693,NICKY,1693,"Where the fuck you get off talkin'
to people about me behind my back?
Goin' over my head?"
1694,ACE,1694,What people?
1695,NICKY,1695,"What people! What'd you think, I
wasn't gonna find out?"
1696,ACE,1696,"I don't even know what you're talkin'
about, Nick."
1697,NICKY,1697,"No? You said I'm bringin' heat on
you?! I gotta listen to people because
of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering
me out?! You better get your own
fuckin' army, pal!"
1698,ACE,1698,"I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't
order you or anybody...  I only told
Andy Stone that you had a lot of
heat on you, and that was a problem."
1699,NICKY,1699,"You want me to get out of my own
fuckin' town?!"
1700,ACE,1700,"Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit
blow over for a while so I can run
the casino. Anything goes wrong with
the casino, it's my ass. It's not
yours, it's my ass."
1701,NICKY,1701,"Oh, I don't know whether you know
this or not, but you only have your
fuckin' casino because I made that
possible!"
1702,ACE,1702,I -
1703,NICKY,1703,"I'm what counts out here! Not your
fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin'
TV shows! And what the fuck are you
doin' on TV anyhow?!"
1704,ACE,1704,What are you -
1705,NICKY,1705,"You know I get calls from back home
every fuckin' day?!  They think you
went batshit!"
1706,ACE,1706,"I'm only on TV because I gotta be
able to hang around the casino. You
understand that. You know that. Come
on."
1707,NICKY,1707,"Your fuckin' ass! You could have had
the food and beverage job without
goin' on television!  You wanted to
go on TV."
1708,ACE,1708,"Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That
way I have a forum. I can fight back.
I'm known. People see me. They know
they can't fuck around with me like
they could if I was an unknown. That's
right."
1709,NICKY,1709,"You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle
of yourself."
1710,ACE,1710,"Me?! I wouldn't even be in this
situation if it wasn't for you. You
brought down so much fuckin' heat on
me. I mean, every time I meet somebody
here, the big question is do I know
you."
1711,NICKY,1711,"Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your
fuckin' license on me, is that it?"
1712,ACE,1712,"No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked
me if you could come out here, what
did I tell you? I mean, you asked
me, and I knew you were going to
come out no matter what I said, but
what did I tell you? Do you remember
what I told..."
1713,NICKY,1713,Back -
1714,ACE,1714,"...you? Do you remember what I told
you?"
1715,NICKY,1715,"Back - Back up, back up a fuckin'
minute here. One minute. I asked
you?! When the fuck did I ever ask
you if I could come out here?! Get
this through your head, you -"
1716,ACE,1716,You never - ?
1717,NICKY,1717,"Get this through your head, you Jew
motherfucker, you. You only exist
out here because of me!  That's the
only reason!  Without me, you,
personally, every fuckin' wiseguy
skell [Skell: the lowest form of
wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll
take a piece of your fuckin' Jew
ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're
fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over
my fuckin' head again! You
motherfucker, you!"
1718,MARINO,1718,"Well, we got company."
1719,NICKY,1719,"Do you see that? Dumb Jew
motherfucker. Grew up together and
he's actin' like he don't even know
me. I know we're supposed to avoid
each other, but, you know, there's
ways to do things and there's ways
not to."
1720,DOMINICK,1720,Yeah. Fuck him.
1721,SHERBERT,1721,To Abraham Lincoln.
1722,ACE,1722,L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
1723,SHERBERT,1723,Here we go. Good luck.
1724,DOMINICK,1724,"Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it
bother you."
1725,NICKY,1725,"Why, does it look like it's bothering
me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin'
Oscar too. All the fuckin' money
I've given that prick, he don't even
look over here. What's his problem?"
1726,MARINO,1726,Mm.
1727,NICKY,1727,"Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't
they?"
1728,MARINO,1728,They're havin' a good time too.
1729,NICKY,1729,So are we.
1730,ACE,1730,Yeah?
1731,SHERBERT,1731,"Sam, we got a problem."
1732,ACE,1732,What is it?
1733,SHERBERT,1733,"The little guy. He's half in the
bag, and nobody told him he was eighty-
sixed from the joint, so we..."
1734,SHERBERT,1734,"...all turned our heads and made out
like we didn't know who he was. He's
over at the twenty-one table with
his..."
1735,SHERBERT,1735,"...nose wide open. He took the money
out of his own kick. His nose is
open for about ten thousand."
1736,SHERBERT (O.S.),1736,"Now, he's really pissed."
1737,ACE,1737,"Oh, no."
1738,SHERBERT,1738,He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
1739,ACE,1739,"No, just - just give him, give him
ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right
down."
1740,SHERBERT,1740,"He's gonna come up with ten thousand,
just the way you wanted."
1741,NICKY,1741,"Ten thou? No, no, no."
1742,SHERBERT,1742,...give you ten thousand -
1743,NICKY,1743,Fifty! I said fifty!
1744,SHERBERT,1744,"Look, take -"
1745,NICKY,1745,"Fuckin' fifty thousand!  Go get it.
I don't give a fuck where you get
it."
1746,NICKY,1746,"Fuckers!  They take it, but they
don't want to give it back."
1747,NICKY,1747,"How the fuck can you grin? How the
fuck could you grin?"
1748,NICKY,1748,"You know how much I'm stuck? You
give a fuck?"
1749,NICKY,1749,Do ya?!
1750,NICKY,1750,"Yeah. Give yourself a hand right
across your fuckin' mouth."
1751,NICKY,1751,"Look at this fuckin' beaut they put
in now. Sherbert send you in here to
rob me now? Been fuckin' knockin'
everybody's dick in all night? Huh?
You been beatin' all the customers
tonight, motherfucker?"
1752,NICKY,1752,"Huh, jag-off? Hit me."
1753,NICKY,1753,"Take this stiff and pound it up your
fuckin' ass! Hit me again."
1754,NICKY,1754,"Take this one and stick it up your
sister's ass! Hit me again."
1755,NICKY,1755,"That's it, keep lookin' at him, you
fuckin' dummy. If you had any fuckin'
heart at all, you'd be out fuckin'
stealin' for a livin'."
1756,NICKY,1756,Hit me again.
1757,NICKY,1757,"What the fuck you keep lookin' at
him for, huh, you fuckin' pu-"
1758,NICKY,1758,"Look at this, twenty fuckin' paints
in a row. Hit me again!"
1759,MARINO,1759,He's here.
1760,NICKY,1760,"You should pay as fast as you collect,
you know."
1761,ACE,1761,"What are you doin'? You gotta get
out of here!"
1762,NICKY,1762,"Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker
over here to pay that marker."
1763,ACE,1763,"Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin'
to me. I'm here to help you. What's
the matter with you?  You're gonna
bury us both."
1764,NICKY,1764,"Just give me the money. Fuckin' give
me the fuckin' money, Sammy."
1765,ACE,1765,"I'm gonna okay you ten and get you
even, and that's it. Then you got to
get out of here before the cops and
the newspapers are all over you."
1766,ACE,1766,Ten and that's it.
1767,NICKY,1767,"What are you starin' at, you bald-
headed Jew prick?!"
1768,NICKY,1768,"Sue me, you Jew fuck!"
1769,MARINO,1769,Let's get out of here.
1770,NICKY,1770,"What? Get out of here? I got a marker
comin'."
1771,NICKY,1771,Deal.
1772,OSCAR,1772,"I know, but everything's changed
now. You're talking about a divorce.
You're even asking for alimony
payments and... child support... and
now custody."
1773,GINGER,1773,"I just want what any divorced woman
would get."
1774,ACE,1774,"I mean she's only sober about two
hours a day. It's usually from eleven
in the morning until one in the
afternoon. And if I gave her her
money and her jewels now, you know
what she's gonna do? She's gonna
piss it all away in about a year,
and then where will she be?"
1775,ACE,1775,"Where would you be then? Comin' right
back to me, right back to me."
1776,ACE,1776,"Or finding some other excuse to come
and I - I -"
1777,GINGER,1777,We had a deal. Remember that?
1778,GINGER,1778,"He said if it didn't work out between
us, that I could get my things and I
could leave."
1779,ACE,1779,Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
1780,ACE,1780,"You know me. Do you see anything in
these eyes that makes you think I
would ever let someone in your
condition take my child away from
me?"
1781,ACE,1781,Do you?  You know that won't happen.
1782,ACE (V.O.),1782,"And after all this time... and as
hard as I tried, as much as I
wanted..."
1783,ACE (V.O.),1783,"...I could never reach her. I could
never make her love me. I always
felt she should have gone for all
that money... being somebody for the
first time in her life, a home and a
kid. But that's not what happened.
It just didn't work out that way."
1784,ACE,1784,Everything all right?
1785,ACE,1785,"I mean, what could we do? After a
while, we'd just take breathers from
each other. You know, little
separations. At that time, I remember
Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly
Hills. She was gonna spend a week or
so shopping."
1786,OPERATOR,1786,"Yes, Mr Rothstein."
1787,ACE,1787,"Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly
Hills, please."
1788,HOTEL OPERATOR (O.S.),1788,"Hello, Beverly Hotel."
1789,ACE (O.S.),1789,"Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please."
1790,HOTEL OPERATOR (O.S.),1790,"I'm sorry.  Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein
have checked out already."
1791,LESTER,1791,Hey.
1792,ACE,1792,"M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?"
1793,LESTER,1793,"Hey, little Dale Evans."
1794,HOTEL OPERATOR (O.S.),1794,"Yes, they both checked out."
1795,ACE,1795,Thank you.
1796,ACE,1796,Hello.
1797,FORLANO,1797,Yeah.
1798,ACE,1798,"Uh, my wife is w-with an old friend
of her i-in LA."
1799,ACE,1799,"Some low-life. A guy named Lester
Diamond."
1800,ACE,1800,"My daughter's with 'em too and I
think they're gonna try and kidnap
her. Is there anybody you can send?"
1801,FORLANO,1801,We'll take care of it.
1802,COUNT ROOM EXEC,1802,We got a number and an address.
1803,ACE,1803,Hello.
1804,LESTER,1804,Hello.
1805,ACE,1805,"Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam..."
1806,ACE,1806,"...Rothstein. I want to talk to
Ginger. Put her on the phone."
1807,LESTER,1807,"She's not here, Sam."
1808,ACE,1808,Lester...
1809,ACE,1809,"...listen to me very carefully. I
want to talk to Ginger. I want my
kid back. I want her put on a plane
immediately."
1810,ACE,1810,"I know she's there. Don't fuck around
with me."
1811,LESTER,1811,"Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't..."
1812,LESTER,1812,"...wouldn't do it. Yeah, no, I, I..."
1813,GINGER,1813,You shouldn't do this.
1814,ACE,1814,"You understand? Put her on the fuckin'
phone."
1815,LESTER,1815,"Sam, I - I don't know where she is,
okay?"
1816,LESTER,1816,"So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell
you - can I call you back in a few
minutes?"
1817,ACE,1817,702 472 1862.
1818,LESTER,1818,Mm-hm.
1819,LESTER,1819,"1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right
b-"
1820,ACE,1820,Right away.
1821,LESTER,1821,I'll call you right back.
1822,ACE,1822,Right back.
1823,LESTER,1823,You got it.
1824,LESTER,1824,Schmuck.
1825,LESTER,1825,"All right. I just bought us a few
minutes. Want to get back at this
prick?"
1826,LESTER,1826,"Hm?  Okay, you got, what, two million
dollars in that box?"
1827,LESTER,1827,"Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's
got two million in the box, am I
right?  Okay, you let him keep your
jewels. We take the cash and the
only other thing he cares about."
1828,LESTER,1828,"Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe.
You dye your hair, get some pl-"
1829,AMY,1829,"I don't want to go to Europe. I want
to go to see The Elephant Man."
1830,LESTER,1830,"We're not gonna go see any fuckin'
elephants, okay?"
1831,GINGER,1831,We'll go later.
1832,LESTER,1832,"We're going to Europe. Let the adults
talk."
1833,LESTER,1833,"You dye your hair... you get plastic
surgery, like we talked about. Right?
You're the mother. How much do you
think he's gonna pay to get this
fuckin' kid back?"
1834,AMY,1834,I don't want to go to Europe.
1835,LESTER,1835,Shut your mouth!
1836,LESTER,1836,You know where she gets this from!
1837,AMY,1837,You shut up.
1838,LESTER,1838,"No, you - You want me to come over
there? I'll smack your face."
1839,LESTER,1839,Don't give me any of your shit!
1840,LESTER,1840,"Okay, this has always been a dream,
but we're going."
1841,GINGER,1841,Lester - he called you here.
1842,LESTER,1842,Right.
1843,GINGER,1843,Here.
1844,LESTER,1844,He was just on the phone.
1845,GINGER,1845,He called you right here.
1846,LESTER,1846,I just talked to him.
1847,GINGER,1847,"So, he knows where you are. That
means he's sending some guys over
here probably right now."
1848,LESTER,1848,"Ginger... It means he's sitting by
the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting
for me to call him back. Now, I -"
1849,GINGER,1849,"That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the
phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting
for you to call him back. That's
what he's -"
1850,LESTER,1850,He's sittin' by the phone -
1851,GINGER,1851,"What do you think we're gonna do?
He's probably got guys outside the
fuckin' house!"
1852,GINGER,1852,"Get your bag! Come on, get your bag!
Get your things! Let's go!"
1853,LESTER,1853,"It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit
right here. This is the fuckin'
problem, you know."
1854,GINGER,1854,"Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want
to fuckin' talk it over now?"
1855,LESTER,1855,"You're done yakkin', okay? You're
done yakkin' now?"
1856,GINGER,1856,Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
1857,LESTER,1857,'Go! Go! Go!'
1858,NICKY,1858,"You just relax. Nobody's killin'
anybody, do you hear?"
1859,GINGER,1859,"No, I really do. I think he's gonna
kill me."
1860,NICKY,1860,"You just relax, and call me back
here in exactly an hour, on this
phone, and I'll see what I can do."
1861,GINGER,1861,"Yeah, uh-huh... Okay."
1862,GINGER,1862,"So, I'm gonna call you back in an
hour... at this number, and you're
gonna be there, right?"
1863,NICKY,1863,I'll be there.
1864,NICKY,1864,"And listen, don't do anything else
crazy, okay? You all right? Okay."
1865,GINGER,1865,Bye.
1866,GINGER,1866,"Just knock it off! Would you two
knock it off? Get in the car."
1867,LESTER,1867,"She started it. She started the whole
thing. I'm just standin' here."
1868,LESTER,1868,"You're not gonna drive. Don't even
think you're gonna drive."
1869,GINGER,1869,"No, I'm gonna drive."
1870,LESTER,1870,"No, I'm not gonna drive with some
crazy -"
1871,GINGER,1871,You're driving me nuts!
1872,LESTER,1872,"Get in the passenger's side! And I'm
sendin' this kid to Bolivia in a
fuckin' box."
1873,NICKY,1873,Ginger -
1874,NICKY,1874,Ginger called me.
1875,ACE,1875,Yeah.
1876,NICKY,1876,I just told you. She called me.
1877,ACE,1877,And what'd she want?
1878,NICKY,1878,She was afraid to call you.
1879,ACE,1879,"Yeah, she's with that cocksucker
again... and they got Amy."
1880,GINGER,1880,"Well, that's why I'm here. She wants
to come back, but she's afraid you're
gonna whack her out."
1881,ACE,1881,"Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid.
What do you want?"
1882,NICKY,1882,"I know. Why didn't you come to me? I
mean, this is family, it ain't
business. Meanwhile, you make calls
back home. Sammy, it makes us look
bad out here, you know what I mean?
Back and forth, this one and that
one, and, in the meantime, she's
gone anyway. Am I right?"
1883,ACE,1883,"I don't know. What am I gonna do
with this woman? I don't know..."
1884,ACE,1884,She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
1885,NICKY,1885,"I think if you, uh, okay it, you
know, assure her that she's gonna be
all right, she'll come back."
1886,ACE,1886,She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
1887,NICKY,1887,"Well, once you get her here, you
think about it, you know?  But get
the kid back here. She wants to come
back. That's the, uh, that's the
main thing here. You want your kid,
don't you? Huh?"
1888,ACE,1888,Hello.
1889,GINGER,1889,"Hi, it's me."
1890,GINGER,1890,"Just who you wanted to talk to, right?"
1891,ACE,1891,Listen...
1892,ACE,1892,"...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you
where you are, just please, put Amy
on a plane. Just put her on right
away, any plane to get her here right
away..."
1893,ACE,1893,"...please. That's all I'm askin'
you."
1894,GINGER,1894,"Do you... I mean... I don't think
she should go by herself."
1895,ACE,1895,What do you mean?
1896,GINGER,1896,"What I mean is, you think if, uh, do
you think if I came back... do you
think you could forgive me?"
1897,ACE,1897,"Uh,"
1898,ACE,1898,"I don't know. I gotta tell you, I
don't know."
1899,GINGER,1899,Right.
1900,GINGER,1900,"I under-understand that. I-I know I
fucked up."
1901,ACE,1901,"What about the money? Uh, where's
the box?"
1902,GINGER,1902,I gotta tell ya...
1903,GINGER,1903,"...I-I... made some mistakes and I
spent some money."
1904,ACE,1904,What's it...
1905,ACE,1905,...under?
1906,GINGER,1906,Pretty serious.
1907,ACE,1907,How serious?
1908,GINGER,1908,"It's, uh, it's under twenty-five."
1909,ACE,1909,It's under...
1910,ACE,1910,...twenty-five thousand?
1911,GINGER,1911,Yeah.
1912,ACE,1912,And...
1913,ACE,1913,"...the rest of the two million is
still there?"
1914,GINGER,1914,"Yeah, yeah, I got the rest."
1915,ACE,1915,"Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah.
He got his twenty-five."
1916,ACE,1916,"That I'll live with. Any more I
couldn't."
1917,GINGER,1917,Okay?
1918,ACE,1918,All right...
1919,ACE,1919,"...all right. Where are you? I'll
send a plane for you right away."
1920,GINGER,1920,"Hi, Sam."
1921,ACE,1921,"So, what'd ya do with it?"
1922,GINGER,1922,With what?
1923,ACE,1923,With the money.
1924,GINGER,1924,He needed some clothes.
1925,ACE,1925,Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
1926,GINGER,1926,"He wanted a watch, too."
1927,ACE,1927,"Twenty-five thousand for clothes and
a watch."
1928,GINGER,1928,Mm-hm.
1929,ACE,1929,Mm-hm.
1930,MAITRE D' (O.S.),1930,Mr. R...
1931,MAITRE D',1931,...good evening. Signora.
1932,GINGER,1932,Gino.
1933,MAITRE D',1933,This way.
1934,ACE (V.O.),1934,"The good part was, I had Amy back.
So, we went home, had the housekeeper
stay over, put the kid to bed, I
calmed myself down and we went to
dinner. I tried to keep things nice
and civil, you know.  But... hey,
twenty-five thousand for three suits?
That doesn't make much sense."
1935,ACE,1935,"First of all, he's not gonna wear f-
thousand-dollar suits. But let's say
he did, which he won't. How you gonna
get fitted for twenty-five suits in
three days?  I, um, I mean, how could
you get fitted that fast? I can't
get fitted that fast, and I pay twice
as much."
1936,GINGER,1936,I bought him a watch too.
1937,ACE,1937,Yeah.
1938,GINGER,1938,Yeah.
1939,ACE,1939,"But even if you bought him a watch,
a really nice watch, one that he
thought was nice - and he doesn't
know what the fuck a good watch is -
so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?"
1940,GINGER,1940,Yeah.
1941,ACE,1941,"At the most, which is impossible for
him."
1942,ACE,1942,"Plus, at the most, three suits, a
thousand apiece. That still leaves
what?  Around ten thousand?"
1943,GINGER,1943,"Would you knock it off, Sam?"
1944,ACE,1944,I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
1945,GINGER,1945,"There's nothin' to figure out. I'm
home... we're workin' it out."
1946,ACE,1946,"Yeah, but I've been told that before,
'We're workin' it out.' You think
that you're home... after what you
just put me through with Amy, is a
favor to me?"
1947,ACE,1947,"So, counting the watch, let's say
another four thousand for expenses
over the weekend... of which you
must have had a good time. I know he
did.  That's for sure. I know that...
fuckin' piece of shit had a good
fuckin' time. On my money. You might
as well have fucked him, which you
probably did anyway."
1948,ACE,1948,"You're lookin' at me a certain way.
You - you're teary-eyed, huh? You're
upset. You're a good actress, you
know that?  Good fuckin' actress.
You can fuckin' get that pity out of
people. I'm not a john, you
understand?  You always thought I
was, but I'm not. And I'm not a
sucker. That fuckin' pimp cocksucker.
He's lucky I didn't kill him last
time. Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.
And if you would've stayed with Amy...
and you would've ran away... you
would've been fuckin' dead."
1949,ACE,1949,Both of you. Dead. Dead.
1950,GINGER (O.S.),1950,"I cannot do it anymore. I can't
fuckin' live like this. It's not
right."
1951,GINGER (O.S.),1951,"What are you? Yes, of course - He
doesn't come home at night.  What is
the big fuckin' deal? I go - Yes,
and I just - I can't fuckin' take
it. Why should I fucking take it?
That wasn't the deal. He acts like...
like I'm the only one around here
with a fuckin' past. He'll never let
me live it down.  Well... well, I
mean, I tried. What the fuck do you
think I came back here for? No, I'm
not!"
1952,GINGER,1952,"I want to have him killed. Yes, I
want him killed.  I've fuckin' had
it."
1953,GINGER,1953,"So, are you with me on this?"
1954,ACE,1954,"You want to get rid of me? Here I
am. Go ahead, get rid of me"
1955,ACE,1955,Hello.
1956,GINGER,1956,"Yes! I fuckin' hate you! I can't
take it anymore!"
1957,GINGER,1957,"Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your
fuckin' guts!"
1958,ACE,1958,"You hate my guts? I want you to come
with me now."
1959,GINGER,1959,Get off of me! Stop it!
1960,ACE,1960,"Come with me now! Come with me now.
Come with me now. I want you out of
here."
1961,ACE,1961,"I want you out of here! I want you
out of here!"
1962,GINGER,1962,Let go of me! Let go of me!
1963,ACE,1963,Take your
1964,ACE,1964,fuckin' bag and get out of here!
1965,GINGER,1965,"I'll go, but I want my money right
now!"
1966,ACE,1966,You'll get your money! Don't worry.
1967,GINGER,1967,The arrangement is over!
1968,ACE,1968,No kidding. NO KIDDING!
1969,GINGER,1969,"And I still get my money. I need
some cash right now. You can't just
put me in the street."
1970,ACE,1970,"I'll get your cash. You haven't been
straight with me ever since I met
you! You never loved me in the first
place!  I need eyes in the back of
my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin'
bitch!"
1971,GINGER,1971,Love you?!
1972,GINGER,1972,"How could I love you?! How can I
love you?! You treat me like I'm
your fucking dog!"
1973,ACE,1973,You're lower than a dog!
1974,GINGER,1974,Fuck you!
1975,ACE,1975,"Here. Here. Is this enough money?!
Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin'
days? Take it, greedy bitch."
1976,ACE,1976,"Take the fuckin' money you fuckin'
want."
1977,GINGER,1977,"I'm going to the bank and I'm getting
my jewelry too!"
1978,ACE,1978,"Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at
9 a.m. Be there!"
1979,GINGER,1979,"And don't send your guys down there
to stop me! I mean it."
1980,ACE,1980,"I guarantee you, I will not stop
you."
1981,GINGER,1981,"Stop! You aren't getting rid of me
with one fuckin' suitcase!"
1982,ACE,1982,"You'll come back tomorrow and get
the rest. Just get out of here."
1983,GINGER,1983,Fine.
1984,GINGER,1984,I'm takin' Amy.
1985,ACE,1985,You're not takin' Amy.
1986,GINGER,1986,I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
1987,ACE,1987,"You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get
out of here."
1988,GINGER,1988,"I am not! She's my daughter too!
Goddamn you!"
1989,ACE,1989,Get out of here!
1990,ACE,1990,Send my lawyers a letter.
1991,ACE,1991,God-fuckin'-damn you!
1992,GINGER (O.S.),1992,"You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna fuck me out of my
end!"
1993,GINGER,1993,Fucker!
1994,ACE (V.O.),1994,"The funny thing was, that after all
that... I didn't want her to go. She
was the mother of my kid. I loved
her. And later... I realized I didn't
want to give her the money, because
if I did... I knew I'd never see her
again."
1995,ACE,1995,Oh. Have a good day at school.
1996,AMY,1996,Okay.
1997,ACE,1997,"Okay? Okay, angel."
1998,ACE,1998,"From now on, I have to know where
you and Amy are at all times."
1999,ACE,1999,"Now, here's a beeper. I want you to
keep it on you. It's very light.  So
I can call you whenever I have to."
2000,ACE,2000,Okay?
2001,NICKY (O.S.),2001,"Well, what are you supposed to do? I
mean, what do you want to do?  Do
you want to stay the way you are?
You want to stay like this?  You
can't do that."
2002,NICKY,2002,"I mean, listen, two people don't get
along, at some point you gotta call
it... I mean, it's none of my
business, but I ... I think that's
what you gotta do. You gotta take it
somewhere -"
2003,GINGER,2003,"Oh, you're right, I know.  It's...
well, I was just -"
2004,NICKY,2004,What? What?
2005,GINGER,2005,Nothin'.
2006,NICKY,2006,What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
2007,GINGER,2007,I don't -
2008,NICKY,2008,"Tell me what you were gonna say. Go
ahead."
2009,GINGER,2009,Yeah?
2010,NICKY,2010,Yeah.
2011,GINGER,2011,"Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you
know somebody at the bank...  could
help me get my jewelry out?  There's
a lot of money in there. Lot of money
in there, and I'd be willing to take
care of anybody who helped me out."
2012,NICKY,2012,Let me think about that.
2013,GINGER,2013,Okay.
2014,NICKY,2014,"See who I got in there. Gotta get
somebody I can trust."
2015,GINGER,2015,Mm-hm.
2016,NICKY,2016,You know?
2017,GINGER,2017,"Yeah. 'Cause, you know,"
2018,GINGER,2018,He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
2019,NICKY,2019,Hm.
2020,GINGER,2020,"He holds that key so tight, he's
probably got it stuck up his ass."
2021,NICKY,2021,"Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's
probably got it there too."
2022,GINGER,2022,"He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have
buried him. I could have gone to
Europe and taken the baby. And then
he'd've tracked me down and he'd've
killed me."
2023,NICKY,2023,"No, he wouldn't. I would have."
2024,NICKY,2024,"And he'd've been right, too. I mean,
seriously."
2025,NICKY,2025,"Well, there's one thing you don't
do. You don't take a guy's kid and
then take off."
2026,GINGER,2026,I didn't.
2027,GINGER,2027,"I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I
did exactly what you told me to do,
and I came right back."
2028,NICKY,2028,You did. You're right.
2029,GINGER,2029,Exactly.
2030,NICKY,2030,"You did. I like that. I like that.
That's what I like about you. You
did the right thing."
2031,GINGER,2031,I did what you told me to.
2032,NICKY,2032,"Yes, you did."
2033,GINGER,2033,"'Cause you always tell me the right
thing to do."
2034,NICKY,2034,Yeah.
2035,NICKY,2035,"Boy, he really fucked himself up out
here -"
2036,NICKY,2036,- didn't he?
2037,GINGER,2037,Sure did.
2038,NICKY,2038,Everything went to his head.
2039,NICKY/GINGER,2039,Changed.
2040,NICKY,2040,"He did. He ain't the same person,
right?"
2041,GINGER,2041,"No, he's not."
2042,NICKY,2042,"He really thinks who the fuck he is,
I'll tell you that."
2043,GINGER,2043,Exactly.
2044,GINGER,2044,He hates me.
2045,GINGER,2045,He hates my fuckin' guts.
2046,NICKY,2046,"Come on, come on, you're a toughie.
You can take this."
2047,NICKY,2047,Don't cry.
2048,GINGER,2048,I'm not as tough as you think I am.
2049,NICKY,2049,"Yes, you are."
2050,GINGER,2050,"I'm not and he scares the shit out
of me. I never know what he's gonna
do."
2051,NICKY,2051,Come on. Don't be scared.
2052,GINGER,2052,"I need some help. I do. I need some
help."
2053,GINGER,2053,"You gotta help me. I need a new
sponsor, Nicky."
2054,GINGER,2054,I do. I need a new sponsor.
2055,NICKY,2055,Is that what you want?
2056,GINGER,2056,Yeah.
2057,NICKY,2057,A sponsor.
2058,GINGER,2058,Yeah.
2059,NICKY,2059,"Mm... okay. Don't worry about it.
Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore.
I'll take care of ya."
2060,GINGER,2060,"Nicky, please..."
2061,NICKY,2061,"Yes, I will. It's what you want,
isn't it? Huh?"
2062,GINGER,2062,"Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2063,NICKY,2063,It's what you want?
2064,GINGER,2064,Yeah. Uh-huh -
2065,FBI AGENT #1 (O.S.),2065,You see that?
2066,FBI AGENT #1,2066,That's Ace's wife.
2067,FBI AGENT #1,2067,Fantastic!
2068,FBI AGENT #1,2068,This is great for the boss.
2069,GINGER,2069,Hi.
2070,ACE,2070,Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
2071,GINGER,2071,I threw it away.
2072,ACE,2072,You threw it away?
2073,GINGER,2073,"Look, I tried to do this thing. I
know that you want me to, but it's
just - You know, I'm driving down
the freeway and the fuckin' thing's
'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm
in a restaurant and it's - it's
embarrassing. I don't want to do it
anymore."
2074,GINGER,2074,Where's Amy?
2075,ACE,2075,I put her to bed.
2076,GINGER,2076,Oh.
2077,GINGER,2077,I got your cigarettes.
2078,GINGER,2078,Oscar wants you to call him.
2079,ACE,2079,"So, who'd you go to lunch with?"
2080,GINGER,2080,With Jennifer.
2081,ACE,2081,And where'd you go?
2082,GINGER,2082,To the Riviera.
2083,ACE,2083,What'd you have?
2084,GINGER,2084,I had a... salad.
2085,ACE,2085,What did Jennifer have?
2086,GINGER,2086,She had the same.
2087,ACE,2087,"Okay. I want you to call Jennifer
and I want you to tell her to tell
you what she had for lunch, and I'm
gonna listen in on the other line."
2088,GINGER,2088,Why do you want to do that?
2089,ACE,2089,"You know why I want to do it. Just
do it."
2090,GINGER,2090,Fine.
2091,GINGER,2091,Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
2092,ACE,2092,Mm.
2093,GINGER,2093,The line's busy. There's nobody there.
2094,JENNIFER,2094,Hello.
2095,ACE,2095,"Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -"
2096,GINGER,2096,"All right... I didn't have lunch
with Jennifer."
2097,ACE,2097,Who were you with?
2098,GINGER,2098,I was with somebody.
2099,ACE,2099,"I know you were with somebody. Who
was it?"
2100,ACE,2100,"I just hope it's not someone who I
think it might be."
2101,ACE,2101,I just hope it's not them.
2102,ACE (V.O.),2102,I knew she fucked around.
2103,ACE (V.O.),2103,You know...
2104,ACE (V.O.),2104,"...she did what she did and I did
what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky
was the worst thing she could've
done."
2105,ACE,2105,What if he won't stop?
2106,ACE (V.O.),2106,"I mean, it could get us both killed."
2107,GINGER,2107,I can back him off.
2108,ACE (V.O.),2108,She was very convincing...
2109,ACE (V.O.),2109,...when she wanted to be.
2110,ACE (V.O.),2110,"And... this... this is how she backed
him off."
2111,NICKY,2111,"Hey, Ginger... don't forget, if you're
challenged, you know, if he asks
anything, deny everything."
2112,NICKY,2112,"Do you understand? I don't want him
bringin' beefs back home ... 'cause
that could be a problem. You gotta
be careful. He's not dumb, you know?
You hear what I'm sayin', right?"
2113,GINGER,2113,"I know. You don't have to tell me
that. What do you think,"
2114,GINGER,2114,I'm stupid?
2115,NICKY,2115,"Do I think you're stupid? No, I think
you're beautiful."
2116,NICKY,2116,But I gotta go.
2117,ACE (V.O.),2117,By this...
2118,ACE (V.O.),2118,"...time, Nicky had things so fucked
up on the streets, that every time
Marino went back home, the..."
2119,ACE (V.O.),2119,"...packages got smaller and smaller.
It got..."
2120,ACE (V.O.),2120,"...to the point when he walked into
the place... he didn't know whether
he was gonna be kissed or killed."
2121,GAGGI (O.S.),2121,"Frankie, I want to ask you something."
2122,GAGGI,2122,"It's private... but I want you to
tell me the truth."
2123,MARINO,2123,"Of course, Remo."
2124,GAGGI,2124,"I want you to tell me the truth,
mind you."
2125,MARINO,2125,"I always tell you the truth, Remo."
2126,GAGGI,2126,"Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't
be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he?
Because if he is... it's a problem."
2127,MARINO (V.O.),2127,"What could I say? I knew if I gave
the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky,
Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've
would up gettin' killed."
2128,MARINO (V.O.),2128,"Because there's one thing about these
old timers: They don't like any
fuckin' around with the other guy's
wives. It's bad for business."
2129,MARINO (V.O.),2129,"So, I lied... even though I knew
that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind
up gettin' killed too."
2130,MARINO,2130,No. I ain't see anything like that.
2131,GAGGI,2131,Are you sure?
2132,MARINO,2132,"I'm positive.  Remo... things are
very fucked up down there, you know?"
2133,GAGGI,2133,"Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking.
You see, my main concern is Nicky."
2134,MARINO,2134,Hm.
2135,GAGGI,2135,"I want to know... if he's doin' all
right. If he's okay."
2136,MARINO,2136,He's good. He's fine.
2137,GAGGI,2137,"I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an
eye on Nicky. Do it for me."
2138,MARINO,2138,No problem.
2139,GAGGI,2139,"You see... I wouldn't want to be
jeopardizing anything for people who
are our friends. You understand?"
2140,MARINO,2140,I understand.
2141,GAGGI,2141,Okay.
2142,GAGGI,2142,"Frankie, you're a good boy."
2143,MARINO,2143,"Thanks, Remo."
2144,ACE (V.O.),2144,"By now, Nicky and his crew had already
hit rock bottom. I mean, Vegas really
got to him."
2145,ACE (V.O.),2145,"The booze, the coke, the broads... I
mean, he got sloppy.  He just wasn't
the same Nicky anymore."
2146,MARINO,2146,You must have drunk too much.
2147,NICKY,2147,Go fuck yourself.
2148,ACE (V.O.),2148,"I heard one night he had to belt a
guy three times before he finally
went down."
2149,ACE (V.O.),2149,"In the old days, Nicky would've decked
him with one shot."
2150,ACE (V.O.),2150,You add this into the mix...
2151,ACE (V.O.),2151,"...to all of us. And his crew followed
him right over the edge."
2152,ACE (V.O.),2152,"They were all tuned up half the time
on coke. I mean, they started doin'..."
2153,ACE (V.O.),2153,...stupid things.
2154,COP #1,2154,"Watch it, partner, watch it!"
2155,ACE (V.O.),2155,The worst was Blue.
2156,BLUE,2156,"Hey, what do you guys want out of my
life, huh?"
2157,COP #1,2157,Police! Stay in the fuckin' car!
2158,ACE (V.O.),2158,"He never knew when to keep his fuckin'
mouth shut."
2159,COP #2,2159,He has a gun!
2160,COP #1,2160,Drop your gun or I'll -!
2161,BLUE,2161,"Hey, fuck you!"
2162,COP #1,2162,Drop the gun!
2163,ACE (V.O.),2163,The cops shot him. They shot Blue...
2164,ACE (V.O.),2164,"...because they thought his hero
sandwich was a gun!"
2165,ACE (V.O.),2165,"You know, they could have..."
2166,ACE (V.O.),2166,"...been right, but who knows?"
2167,COP #1,2167,"Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a
fuckin' hero sandwich here."
2168,COP #2,2168,"What do you want? It - It's pitch-
black out here. It's tin foil."
2169,COP #1,2169,Pitch-black?! It -
2170,COP #2,2170,It looked like a fuckin' gun!
2171,COP #1,2171,"You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be
filling out paper work for the next
two months because of you and this
piece of shit, you..."
2172,COP #2,2172,"Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm
sorry."
2173,COP #1,2173,...fuckin' jerk-off.
2174,ACE (V.O.),2174,"And to make matters worse, to get
even, Nicky's crew got stoned one
night and they started shootin' up
the cops' houses."
2175,ACE (V.O.),2175,"I mean, it got to the point where
they couldn't even talk in the Gold
Rush anymore because the Feds put a
wire in the wall."
2176,ACE (V.O.),2176,"And even when they talked outside,
they had to cover their mouths
because..."
2177,LIP-READER,2177,"Jeez, he's coverin' up again."
2178,ACE (V.O.),2178,...the Feds brought in lip-readers.
2179,ACE (V.O.),2179,"Nicky found out about it from a teller
who owed him money.  This guy
worked..."
2180,MARINO,2180,"He asked me again about you and the
Jew's wife."
2181,NICKY,2181,"Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?"
2182,MARINO,2182,"He asked me again about you and the
Jew's wife."
2183,NICKY,2183,"Yeah, what'd you tell him?"
2184,MARINO,2184,"I told him I didn't know nothin'.
But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said
if you did anything, you're fucked
up."
2185,NICKY,2185,"You think he's goin' home, makin' a
beef behind my back?"
2186,MARINO,2186,Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
2187,NICKY,2187,"Yeah, what's to stop him?"
2188,MARINO,2188,I know. I know.
2189,NICKY,2189,"I don't trust him anymore. But they'd
never okay anything, you know?"
2190,MARINO,2190,"Yeah, but they keep askin' about it."
2191,NICKY,2191,"Well, now, sure they're askin'. They
earn with the prick. I got a funny
feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin'
war or somethin'."
2192,NICKY,2192,"I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w-
You know, but you know what I want
you to do?"

2195,MARINO,2195,"Oh, he ain't nobody."
2196,NICKY,2196,"You know what I want you to do? Get
a couple of guys to dig a hole in
the desert, then let 'em show you
where it's at."
2197,MARINO,2197,Angelo and Buster.
2198,NICKY,2198,"Yeah, but I'm not sure yet."
2199,MARINO,2199,They'll do it.
2200,NICKY,2200,"And when I'm ready, I'll say the
words, 'Go see the Jew.'"
2201,MARINO,2201,Yeah.
2202,NICKY,2202,"And you make it disappear, you know
what I mean?"
2203,MARINO,2203,"Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta
be ready. You know what I'm talkin'
about?"
2204,NICKY,2204,"Did I say to do anything yet? I said
I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I
want to think about it. Where're
these pricks at?"
2205,MARINO,2205,Don't know.
2206,NICKY,2206,Dominick said they're in the motel?
2207,MARINO,2207,"Yeah, either that or in the fuckin'
bank. I don't know. They're all over
the joint."
2208,ACE,2208,Be right back. I'll be right back.
2209,ACE,2209,"Rudy, any calls for me, just give
'em to Mr Sherbert. I'll be right

2210,RUDY,2210,"Sure, Mr Rothstein. You'll be back...?"
2211,ACE,2211,"I'm going home for a few seconds.

2226,ACE,2226,"When did this happen, honey?"
2227,AMY,2227,I don't know.
2228,ACE,2228,"You don't know? What time did your

2236,NICKY,2236,"Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?"
2237,ACE,2237,"No, I'm not okay."
2238,ACE,2238,How'd you know I was here?
2239,NICKY,2239,Well...
2240,NICKY,2240,"...uh, you know, I just wanted to
talk to you a minute."
2241,ACE,2241,Well...
2242,ACE,2242,"...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy
up and she locked her in her room. I

2245,ACE,2245,She's there with you?
2246,NICKY,2246,"Yeah, she's here."
2247,ACE,2247,I'll be right there.
2248,NICKY,2248,"Uh, all right."

2250,DOMINICK,2250,Great!
2251,NICKY,2251,"Ace don't... listen, don't... don't

2252,ACE,2252,"I want to just talk. I want to talk
to that Irish bitch."
2253,NICKY,2253,She didn't know who to turn to.
2254,NICKY,2254,"She... she didn't know where to turn.
She was tryin' to save your marriage."
2255,ACE,2255,"Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that
fuckin' bitch."
2256,NICKY,2256,"Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice.
Don't fuck up in here."

child. Are you out of your fuckin'
mind?"
2261,GINGER,2261,"It's just for a little while, Sam.
The baby-sitter wasn't there."
2262,ACE,2262,"I ought to fuckin' have you committed.
You fuckin' do that again,"
2263,ACE,2263,"I'll f-, I'll f-"
2264,GINGER,2264,"She wasn't gonna get up. I was just

2265,ACE,2265,I should have -

woke up."
2267,ACE,2267,"Listen to me, listen to me, listen

2275,ACE,2275,"You listen carefully! You ever fuckin'
touch her again, you ever do anything
like that again, I'll fuckin' kill
you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear
me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll

2276,GINGER,2276,"Why don't you just let me go, Sam?"
2277,ACE,2277,You fuckin' whore!
2278,GINGER,2278,"I'll sign anything you want me to
sign, okay?"
2279,ACE,2279,You understand? What? Let you go?
2280,GINGER,2280,"I just want the key to my jewelry,
and I want you to let me go."
2281,ACE,2281,You want your jewelry?
2282,GINGER,2282,I want you to let me go.
2283,ACE,2283,"And what? And let you disgrace me,

2296,GINGER,2296,"I'm going. I'm going, you -!"
2297,ACE,2297,"Now you need approval from him to go
home?"
2298,GINGER,2298,"So what? So who fuckin' blew you in
the parking lot before you came in...
huh?"
2299,ACE,2299,"You make me sick, you fuck. Once a
fuckin' hooker, always a hooker."
2300,GINGER,2300,"Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!"
2301,GINGER,2301,Fuck you!
2302,ACE,2302,"Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put

2303,SHERBERT,2303,Who's this?
2304,ACE,2304,"Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to
you later. Just - You - You got a
gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over
here right away."
2305,SHERBERT,2305,Okay. Just take it easy.
2306,ACE,2306,Right away. Okay?
2307,SHERBERT,2307,I-I'll do it.
2308,ACE,2308,Okay.
2309,GINGER,2309,Leave it where it is.
2310,GINGER,2310,"Where is he? Goddamn it! I want that
Jew bastard killed! I have fuckin'

2311,MARINO,2311,"Calm down, calm down. Shh!"
2312,NICKY,2312,Shh.
2313,NICKY,2313,Hide her car in the back!
2314,GINGER,2314,"There's no reason to hide my car. He
already knows!"
2315,GINGER,2315,"He threw it in my face! The second I
get out of here, I -"
2316,NICKY,2316,"What did I tell you? Supposing he
goes back home and makes a fuckin'
beef?  I gotta know exactly what you
said. Tell me what you said to him."
2317,GINGER,2317,"Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I
said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he
said, I just kept sayin' no."
2318,NICKY,2318,"I told you this was fuckin' dangerous.
Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a
dangerous situation. Be very careful.'
You fuckin' yessed me to death."
2319,GINGER,2319,"If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then
why don't you kill him?"
2320,NICKY,2320,"I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the
fuck up. What, do you know what you're
talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-"
2321,GINGER,2321,"Oh, well, then, have him killed and

will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin'
guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna
fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck...

2323,GINGER,2323,What about my money?
2324,NICKY,2324,"How the fuck am I gonna get your
fuckin' money now? You think he's
gonna give you fuckin' money? Are
you out of your mind?!  Look what
you just did to this fuckin' guy!
If you would have just kept your
fuckin' mouth shut!"
2325,NICKY,2325,"Ah, what the fuck is the use? I

2345,NICKY,2345,Look at this motherfucker.
2346,NICKY,2346,"I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up
good this time. Should have never
started with this fuckin' broad."
2347,MARINO,2347,"Take it easy. What could you do? I
mean, she threw herself at you, right?"
2348,NICKY,2348,"I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You
know that? Bad fuckin' spot."
2349,ACE (V.O.),2349,"I already left the kid with neighbors
and I had about a million in cash

2394,COP #2,2394,"Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let
her in the house and get a few of

than a few more minutes."
2425,COP #1,2425,"No, it's - it'll just be a couple of
minutes. We got other things to do

How's everything else besides this?"
2426,ACE,2426,"Fine, fine. How's your family?"

2467,COP #2,2467,Like this?
2468,GINGER,2468,"Yeah, just hold the top open, all
right, and I can -"
2469,GINGER,2469,"Oh, God. It's him."
2470,GINGER,2470,"You have to stop him. You have to -
'Cause he said he was going to kill
me."
2471,GINGER,2471,You just - Just stop him.
2472,COP #1,2472,"Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where
you goin' -"
2473,ACE,2473,Stop -
2474,COP #1,2474,"Wait, hold on a second."
2475,ACE,2475,Hey!
2476,COP #1,2476,Hold on a second.
2477,COP #1,2477,"Nothin' we can do about it. Nothin'
we can do. There's nothin' we can
do."
2478,ACE,2478,"Look, look. You can't stop her for
speeding? I mean, look what the hell
she's doing."
2479,COP #1,2479,Speeding?
2480,COP #2,2480,We're talkin' to you right now.
2481,COP #2,2481,"There's nothing we can do. She had
the key."
2482,COP #1,2482,"She's on the account. There's nothing
we can do."
2483,FBI AGENT #1,2483,"Let's pull her over at that Citgo
Station."
2484,FBI AGENT #2,2484,"Okay, let's do it."
2485,FBI AGENT #2,2485,"We're - we're placing you under arrest
for -"
2486,GINGER,2486,For what?
2487,FBI AGENT #2,2487,"We're placing you under arrest for
aiding and abetting -"
2488,GINGER,2488,What?
2489,FBI AGENT #2,2489,"We're placing you under arrest for
aiding and abetting a -"
2490,GINGER,2490,But I'm just trying to leave.
2491,ACE (V.O.),2491,"After all the threats and all the
bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't
tell 'em anything. But by then, the
Feds didn't need her, anyway."
2492,GINGER,2492,But it was just mine.
2493,ACE (V.O.),2493,They had all the pieces they needed.
2494,FBI AGENT #1,2494,Come on.
2495,GINGER,2495,But I didn't do anything.
2496,ACE (V.O.),2496,And everybody...
2497,ACE (V.O.),2497,...began to tumble.
2498,FBI AGENT #3,2498,FBI! We have a warrant!
2499,ACE (V.O.),2499,"...one after the other... just like
dominoes. Between Piscano complaining
on a wire."
2500,ACE (V.O.),2500,"Between Nicky, Ginger, me and my
license... paradise... we managed to
really fuck it all up."
2501,LITTLE NICKY,2501,Mom!
2502,JENNIFER (O.S.),2502,"Yeah, well, someone's at the fuckin'
door now."
2503,FBI AGENT #4,2503,FBI. We have a federal search warrant.
2504,NICKY (V.O.),2504,"Right away, I got wind of the pinches
comin' down, so I took off. Who needs
to hang around for that bullshit?"
2505,FBI AGENT #4,2505,"My name is Marc Caspar, Special Agent,
FBI."
2506,JENNIFER,2506,"Yeah, well,"
2507,JENNIFER,2507,Can I make a fuckin' phone call?
2508,FBI AGENT #4,2508,"Hey, ho-hold it for a minute. You
can make a phone call, but you don't
have to talk to us like that."
2509,JENNIFER,2509,Hey -
2510,FBI AGENT #5,2510,FBI! Don't be alarmed.
2511,NICKY (V.O.),2511,But they got almost everybody else.
2512,FBI AGENT #5,2512,This area is seized.
2513,DUPREY,2513,Grab everything in sight.
2514,FBI AGENT #6,2514,Right.
2515,DUPREY,2515,Get the master account list!
2516,AUSTIN,2516,"I want all those papers seized,
regardless of what they are."
2517,AUSTIN,2517,"I want this area off-limits to
everybody."
2518,AUSTIN,2518,"Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps
figures.  [Actual amount taken from
craps tables before the skim.] Hey -
Hey."
2519,ACE (V.O.),2519,Green?
2520,ACE (V.O.),2520,Don't even ask.
2521,FBI AGENT #8,2521,Thirty thousand dollars...
2522,GREEN,2522,"No, he didn't. And that's why it
wasn't valid. I was being extorted,
all right?  I'm willing to tell you
whatever you want to know. I've got
nothin' to hide here."
2523,NICKY (V.O.),2523,"Now, for the best..."
2524,NICKY (V.O.),2524,"...and I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the
cake."
2525,FBI AGENT #9,2525,"Oh, this is good. Bingo!"
2526,NICKY (V.O.),2526,"He might as well have given them a
fuckin' blueprint.  Everybody's names,
address, dates, everything."
2527,FBI AGENT #9,2527,"Look at this! That you so much, Mr
Piscano. How considerate of you.
Appreciate it."
2528,PISCANO,2528,"Those are my m- those are my mother's
books."
2529,FBI AGENT #10,2529,You're under arrest.
2530,NICKY (V.O.),2530,What a fuckin' balloon head.
2531,PISCANO,2531,What are you guys doin'?!
2532,FBI AGENT #10,2532,"Take it easy, Artie. We just want to
talk to you."
2533,PISCANO'S WIFE,2533,"Artie, are you okay? Sweetheart?
Honey? Wait a minute! He's sick!
Artie! Oh, God!"
2534,FBI AGENT #10,2534,Move back! Come on!
2535,FBI AGENT #9,2535,Dave!
2536,PISCANO'S WIFE,2536,He's sick! It's his heart!
2537,FBI AGENT #9,2537,CPR! Now!
2538,PISCANO'S WIFE,2538,"Oh, God, is he breathing? He's not
breathing!"
2539,ACE (V.O.),2539,"Poor Artie. He got so upset he had a
heart attack and dropped dead right
there in front of his wife."
2540,PISCANO'S WIFE,2540,Artie!
2541,FBI AGENT #10,2541,Calm down! Calm down!
2542,PISCANO'S WIFE,2542,"No, I won't calm down! He's my
husband!"
2543,FBI AGENT #10,2543,Stay out of the way!
2544,PISCANO'S WIFE,2544,Artie! Artie!
2545,FBI AGENT #10,2545,We can't help him if -
2546,ACE (V.O.),2546,"And at the end of the day, they
finally came to see me with the
pictures."
2547,FBI AGENT #1,2547,"Why protect a friend who betrayed
you like that?"
2548,ACE (V.O.),2548,"But I didn't want to look at 'em. I
didn't want to look at the guys who
brought 'em either."
2549,LAWYER,2549,"Your Honor, as you can see, my clients
are elderly and infirm. Any
incarceration could pose a serious
health risk. They are no danger to
the community and they pose no flight
risk."
2550,NICKY (V.O.),2550,"When the bosses were arrested, some
of 'em were so old they needed doctors
at their arraignment."
2551,LAWYER,2551,"And Pre-trial Services recommends
that bail remain as presently set."
2552,JUDGE,2552,"We're going to take a ten-minute
recess."
2553,NICKY (V.O.),2553,"And when it looked like they could
get twenty-five years..."
2554,NICKY (V.O.),2554,"...to life in prison, just for
skimmin' a casino... sick or no
fuckin' sick, you knew people were
gonna get clipped. So, the day of
the arraignment, they had this meeting
right in the back of the court-house."
2555,NICKY (V.O.),2555,"See, when something like this happens,
you know how things are gonna work
out. It's always better with no
witnesses. So, what about Andy?"
2556,FORLANO,2556,"He won't talk. Stone is a good kid.
Stand-up guy, just like his old man.
That's the way I see it."
2557,BORELLI,2557,I agree. He's solid. A fuckin' Marine.
2558,CAPELLI,2558,"He's okay. He always was. Remo, what
do you think?"
2559,GAGGI,2559,"Look... why take a chance? At least,
that's the way I feel about it."
2560,STONE,2560,"You call Artie... and you tell him I
don't care what, he's gotta be in my
office Thursday morning before eleven
o'clock."
2561,LAWYER,2561,It's done.
2562,LAWYER (O.S.),2562,It's done.
2563,STONE,2563,"It's terribly important. I gotta
have a conversation with this guy.
That's all."
2564,NICKY (V.O.),2564,"As much as they liked him, I mean,
he wasn't one of us. He wasn't
Italian. As far as they knew, he
could have talked. Otherwise, Stony
might still be alive."
2565,NICKY (V.O.),2565,"The first one to skip was John Nance.
He found a nice, warm secluded place
in Costa Rica. He thought nobody
would find him there."
2566,NICKY (V.O.),2566,"But, then, his kid got nabbed by the
Feds for drugs, and so naturally the
bosses were afraid he'd come out of
hidin' just to save his kid and give
'em all up.  So..."
2567,CURLY,2567,"Hey, where you goin', jag-off?"
2568,NICKY (V.O.),2568,"But anyway, they, you know, they all
had to follow."
2569,NICKY (V.O.),2569,Everybody went down.
2570,COUNT ROOM EXEC,2570,"Go ahead, fuck..."
2571,CURLY,2571,Fuck you.
2572,NICKY (V.O.),2572,Before you knew it...
2573,NICKY (V.O.),2573,"...anybody who knew anything wound
up gettin' whacked."
2574,GINGER (O.S.),2574,"Oh! Oh, no!  No..."
2575,ACE (V.O.),2575,"After Ginger took off, she wasn't
much help to anybody. She found some
pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers
in LA. And in a few months, they
went through all the money and all
the jewels."
2576,ACE (V.O.),2576,"After they found her body... I had a
private doctor do another autopsy.
He said they gave her... a hot dose.
In the end... all she had left was
thirty-six hundred in mint-condition
coins."
2577,ACE (V.O.),2577,"No matter what the Feds or the papers
might have said about my car
bombing..."
2578,ACE (V.O.),2578,"...it was amateur night, and you
could tell. Whoever it was, they put
the dynamite under the passenger
side. But what they didn't know,
what nobody outside the factory knew,
was that that model car was made
with a metal plate under the driver's
seat. It's the only thing that saved
my life."
2579,ACE (V.O.),2579,"The bombing was never authorized,
but I suspect I know who lit the
fuse."
2580,FAT SALLY (O.S.),2580,"Hey, Nicky."
2581,ACE (V.O.),2581,And so did the power that be.
2582,NICKY,2582,"Hey, Mikey, how's your hernia?"
2583,FAT SALLY,2583,How you doin'?
2584,NICKY (V.O.),2584,It took months for...
2585,NICKY: (V.O.),2585,"...everything to calm down, but
finally my guys got out on bail and
the bosses wanted me to send my
brother Dominick out to Vegas.  Always
the dollars, always the fuckin'..."
2586,NICKY (V.O.),2586,"...dollars. I mean, it was still way
too hot for me to even go near Vegas,
so I set up a meeting with the guys
way out in the sticks. I didn't want
my brother to get fucked around."
2587,NICKY (V.O.),2587,"I mean, what's right is right. They
don't give a fuck about - urgghh!"
2588,FAT SALLY,2588,"Huh? Come on, you fuckin' rat."
2589,DOMINICK,2589,Fuck!  You...
2590,DOMINICK,2590,...rat motherfucker! You rat mother-
2591,MARINO,2591,Tough guy! You and your f-
2592,MARINO,2592,Fuckin' brother!
2593,DOMINICK,2593,"Oh, you - !"
2594,MARINO,2594,No more!
2595,FAT SALLY,2595,"Get him, Marino!"
2596,MARINO,2596,You fuckin' scumbag!
2597,MARINO,2597,No more.
2598,NICKY,2598,Frankie!
2599,MARINO,2599,No more! You see? Watch!
2600,NICKY,2600,"Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!"
2601,MARINO,2601,"Fuck you, you motherfuck!"
2602,NICKY,2602,"Fuckin' punk, motherfucker! Piece of
shit!"
2603,MARINO,2603,No more fuckin' dirty work!
2604,NICKY,2604,"No, no, no, no!"
2605,MARINO,2605,"Take him out! Take this motherfucker
out!"
2606,NICKY,2606,"Dominick! Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom.
Frankie."
2607,NICKY,2607,"Frankie, leave the kid alone. He's
still breathin'. He's still breathin'.
Leave him alone. Frankie."
2608,MARINO,2608,All right. Strip him.
2609,NICKY,2609,"No balls, you got no fuckin' balls.
Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom."
2610,NICKY,2610,Dominick.  Dominick.
2611,NICKY,2611,Dominick.
2612,MARINO,2612,"Come on, come on. Bury 'em."
2613,ACE (V.O.),2613,"The word was out. The bosses had had
enough of Nicky. They had enough.
How much were they gonna take? So,
they made an example of him and his
brother. They buried them while they
were still breathing."
2614,MAN #1,2614,"Mister, you all right?"
2615,MAN #2,2615,"Watch out, the -!"
2616,MAN #2,2616,"Mister, you all right?"
2617,ACE,2617,Yeah.
2618,ACE (V.O.),2618,They had other ideas for me.
2619,AMBULANCE DRIVER,2619,"You sure are lucky, mister."
2620,ACE (V.O.),2620,"The town will never be the same.
After the..."
2621,ACE (V.O.),2621,"...Tangiers, the big corporations
took it all over. Today it looks
like..."
2622,ACE (V.O.),2622,...Disneyland.
2623,ACE (V.O.),2623,"And while the kids play cardboard
pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the
house payments and Junior's college
money..."
2624,ACE (V.O.),2624,...on the poker slots.
2625,ACE (V.O.),2625,"In the old days, dealers knew your
name, what you drank, what you played.
Today, it's like checkin' into an
airport. And if you order room
service, you're lucky if you get it
by Thursday."
2626,ACE (V.O.),2626,"Today, it's all gone. You get a whale
show up with four million in a..."
2627,ACE (V.O.),2627,"...suitcase, and some twenty-five-
year-old hotel school kid is gonna
want his Social Security Number."
2628,ACE (V.O.),2628,After the Teamsters got...
2629,ACE (V.O.),2629,"...knocked out of the box, the
corporations tore down practically
every one of the old casinos. And
where did the money come from..."
2630,ACE (V.O.),2630,"...to rebuild the pyramids?... Junk
bonds."
2631,ACE,2631,Still not sure?
2632,RACE ANNOUNCER,2632,They're off and running...
2633,ACE,2633,"Probable, but may be questionable.
All right. Well, let me know as soon
as you can find out."
2634,ACE (V.O.),2634,"But in the end, I wound up right
back where I started. I could still
pick winners, and I could still make
money for all kinds of people back
home. And why mess up a good thing?
And that's that."
