Starship Enterprise on training
mission to Gamma Hydra. Section 14,
coordinates 22/87/4. Approaching
Neutral Zone, all systems
functioning."
1,SULU,1,"Leaving Section Fourteen for
Section Fifteen."
2,SAAVIK,2,"Project parabolic course to
avoid entering Neutral Zone."
3,SULU,3,"Aye, Captain."
4,UHURA,4,"Captain... I'm getting something
on the distress channel. Minimal
signal... But something..."
5,SAAVIK,5,Can you amplify?
6,UHURA,6,I'm trying...
7,SULU,7,Course change projected.
8,UHURA,8,It's an emergency distress call!
9,SAAVIK,9,On speakers!
10,VOICE,10,"Imperative! Imperative! This is
the Kobayashi Maru -- nineteen
periods out of Altair Six. We
have struck a gravitic mine and
have lost all power... Our hull
is..."
11,VOICE,11,... and many casualties.
12,UHURA,12,"This is the Starship Enterprise.
Your message is breaking up. Give
your coordinates. Repeat --"
13,VOICE,13,"Enterprise, our position is Gamma
Hydra, Section Ten..."
14,SAAVIK,14,In the neutral zone.
15,VOICE,15,"Hull penetrated, life support
systems failing. Can you assist
us, Enterprise? Can you..."
16,SAAVIK,16,Data on Kobayashi Maru! Tactical!
17,COMPUTER VOICE,17,"Subject vessel is third class
neutronic fuel carrier, crew of
eighty-one, three hundred passengers."
18,SAAVIK,18,Damn.
19,SAAVIK,19,"Mr. Sulu, plot an intercept course."
20,SULU,20,"May I remind the Captain that if a
Starship enters the zone --"
21,SAAVIK,21,"I'm aware of my responsibilities,
Mister."
22,SULU,22,"... Now entering the Neutral
Zone..."
23,COMPUTER VOICE,23,"Warning. We have entered the
Neutral Zone... Warning..."
24,SULU,24,Estimating two minutes to intercept.
25,SAAVIK,25,"Stand by transporter room, ready
to beam survivors, aboard."
26,UHURA,26,"Captain, I've lost their signal!"
27,COMPUTER VOICE,27,"Alert. Sensors indicate three
Klingon Cruisers, bearing 316,
mark 4, closing fast."
28,SAAVIK,28,Visual!
29,SAAVIK,29,Battle stations! Activate shields!
30,SULU,30,Shields activated!
31,SAAVIK,31,"Inform the Klingons we are on a
rescue mission..."
32,UHURA,32,"They're jamming all frequencies,
Captain --"
33,COMPUTER VOICE,33,Klingons on attack course and closing.
34,SAAVIK,34,"We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu,
get us out of here."
35,SULU,35,"I'll try, Captain."
36,COMPUTER VOICE,36,"Klingon cruisers approaching,
bearing 090, mark 20."
37,SAAVIK,37,Visual!
38,SAAVIK,38,Evasive action!
39,SAAVIK,39,Engineering! damage report!
40,SCOTTY'S VOICE,40,"Main energizer hit, Captain!"
41,SAAVIK,41,"Engage auxiliary power. Prepare
to return fire!"
42,A CADET,42,"Shields collapsing, Captain!"
43,SCOTTY'S VOICE,43,"Captain, we're losing auxiliary
power!"
44,SAAVIK,44,Fire all phasers...!
45,SPOCK,45,"No power to the weapons system,
sir."
46,SCOTTY'S VOICE,46,"Captain, it's no use. We're
dead in space."
47,SAAVIK,47,"Activate escape pods. Send out the
Log Buoy... All hands abandon ship.
Repeat -- all hands --"
48,KIRK'S VOICE,48,"All right, open her up."
49,SAAVIK,49,"Any suggestions, Admiral?"
50,KIRK,50,"Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons
do not take prisoners."
51,KIRK,51,Captain.
52,SPOCK,52,Trainees to the briefing room.
53,KIRK,53,"Physician, heal thyself."
54,BONES,54,That's all you have to say?
55,KIRK,55,I'm not a drama critic.
56,KIRK,56,"Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going
to stay with the sinking ship?"
57,SAAVIK,57,"Permission to speak candidly, sir?"
58,KIRK,58,Very well.
59,SAAVIK,59,"I don't believe this was a fair
test of my command capabilities."
60,KIRK,60,And why not?
61,SAAVIK,61,Because... there was no way to win.
62,KIRK,62,"A no-win situation is a possibility
every commander may face. Has that
never occurred to you?"
63,SAAVIK,63,"... No, sir. It has not."
64,KIRK,64,"How we deal with death is at least
as important as how we deal with
life, wouldn't you say?"
65,SAAVIK,65,"As I indicated, Admiral, that
thought had not occurred to me."
66,KIRK,66,"Then you have something new to think
about. Carry on."
67,BONES,67,"Wouldn't it be easier to put
an experienced crew back on the
ship?"
68,KIRK,68,"They'll learn. Galloping about the
cosmos is a game for the young,
doctor."
69,UHURA,69,What is that supposed to mean?
70,KIRK,70,Aren't you dead?
71,KIRK,71,"I assume you are loitering here
to learn what efficiency rating
I plan to give your cadets."
72,SPOCK,72,I am understandably curious.
73,KIRK,73,"They destroyed the simulator room
and you with it."
74,SPOCK,74,The
75,Kobayshi Maru,75,"scenario
frequently wreaks havoc with
students and equipment."
76,Kobayshi Maru,76,"As I recall you took the test
three times yourself. Your final
solution was, shall we say, unique?"
77,KIRK,77,"It had the virtue of never having
been tried."
78,SPOCK,78,"Yours was not a solution which
would have occurred to a Vulcan
mentality."
79,KIRK,79,"So you said at the time. Speaking
of which, your protg's first
rare -- a trifle emotional --"
80,SPOCK,80,"She's half Romulan, Jim. The
admixture makes her more volatile
than -- me, for example."
81,KIRK,81,"Than you. Yes, I see that. By
the way, thank you for this."
82,SPOCK,82,I know of your fondness for antiques.
83,KIRK,83,"'It was the best of times, it was
the worst of times...' Message,
Spock?"
84,SPOCK,84,"None of which I am consciously
aware -- except, of course, happy
birthday -- surely the best of times."
85,KIRK,85,"Hrummm... and where are you off
to, now?"
86,SPOCK,86,"The Enterprise. I must check in
before your inspection. And you?"
87,KIRK,87,Home.
88,SPOCK,88,Something oppresses you.
89,KIRK,89,Something.
90,CHEKOV'S VOICE,90,"Starship log, Stardate 8130.4.
This report classified MOST SECRET.
Log Entry by Commander Pavel Chekov,
Duty Officer. Starship USS Reliant
on orbital approach with Ceti Alpha
VI in connection with project code
name GENESIS. We are continuing
our search for a lifeless planet
which will serve as a suitable test
site for the Genesis Experiments.
This is the 16th planet we have
visited, so far, no success."
91,TERRELL,91,"Standard orbit, Mr. Beach."
92,BEACH,92,"Standard orbit, sir."
93,TERRELL,93,Any change in surface scan?
94,BEACH,94,"Negative. Limited atmosphere,
dominated by craylon gas, sand and
high velocity winds. Incapable
of supporting life forms."
95,"Ceti Alpha
CHEKOV",95,Does it have to be
96,completely,96,lifeless?
97,TERRELL,97,Don't tell me you've got something.
98,CHEKOV,98,"We've picked up a minor energy flux
reading on one dyno scanner."
99,TERRELL,99,"Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the
scanner's out of adjustment --"
100,CHEKOV,100,I suppose it
101,could,101,"be a particle
of preanimate matter caught in the
matrix..."
102,TERRELL,102,"All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to
Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something
we can transplant."
103,CHEKOV,103,You know what she'll say...
104,CAROL MARCUS'S VOICE,104,"Something you can transplant? I
don't know --"
105,TERRELL,105,"It might only be a particle of
preanimate matter..."
106,CAROL,106,"Then again it might not. You
boys have to be clear on this:
there can't be so much as a
microbe or the show's off."
107,CAROL,107,"Why don't you have a look? If it
IS something that can be moved..."
108,TERRELL,108,"You bet, doctor. We're on our way!"
109,DAVID,109,"How can you let them pull that
stuff on you? They're just lazy."
110,CAROL,110,"And bored. I know. But maybe it
IS something they can..."
111,DAVID,111,"Come on, Mother, that's just the
military mentality. Never put off
tomorrow what you can put off today.
If there's one atom of life..."
112,CAROL,112,"I know, I know..."
113,DAVID,113,"Well, don't have kittens.
Genesis is going to work. They'll
remember  you in a wreath with
Newton, Einstein, Surak..."
114,CAROL,114,"Thanks a lot. No respect from my
offspring --"
115,DAVID,115,"Par for the course... you teaming
up with me for bridge after dinner?"
116,CAROL,116,Maybe...
117,DAVID,117,"Every time we have dealings with
Starfleet, I get nervous."
118,DAVID,118,"We're dealing with something
that COULD be perverted into
a dreadful weapon. Remember that
overgrown boy scout you used to
hang out with? That's exactly
the --"
119,CAROL,119,"Listen, kiddo, Jim Kirk was many
things, but he was never a Boy
Scout..."
120,KIRK,120,Come.
121,KIRK,121,"Bless me, doctor; and what beams
you into this neck of the woods?"
122,BONES,122,"'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.'
Happy Birthday..."
123,KIRK,123,"Romulan Ale! Bones, you know
this stuff is illegal --"
124,BONES,124,"I only use it for medicinal
purposes. Don't be a pring..."
125,KIRK,125,"Twenty-two, eighty-three..."
126,BONES,126,"Takes the stuff a while to
ferment. Gimme."
127,BONES,127,Now open the other one.
128,KIRK,128,"I'm almost afraid to. What did
you bring me, contraband Klingon --"
129,BONES,129,"More antiques for your collection
-- Cheers!"
130,KIRK,130,"Cheers. Bones, these are... charming."
131,BONES,131,"Four hundred years old. You don't
find many with the lens still
intact."
132,KIRK,132,Uh -- what are they?
133,BONES,133,"For your eyes. For most patients
of your age, I generally administer
Retlax Five to restore flexibility
of the lens."
134,KIRK,134,But I'm allergic to Retlax.
135,BONES,135,Exactly. Happy birthday.
136,BONES,136,"Slide them down your nose. Now look
at me over the top. And you read
printed matter through the bottom."
137,KIRK,137,Amazing! I don't know what to say --
138,BONES,138,Say thank you.
139,KIRK,139,Thank you.
140,BONES,140,"Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the
matter? Other people have birthdays.
Why're we treating yours like a funeral?"
141,KIRK,141,"Bones, I don't want to be lectured."
142,BONES,142,"What DO you want? Damn it, why
isn't there a girl here? You know
this has nothing to do with age.
This is about you flying a goddamn
computer console when you wanna be
out hopping Galaxies."
143,KIRK,143,"Spare me your notions of poetry,
please. We all have our assigned
duties and..."
144,BONES,144,"Bull. You're hiding -- hiding
behind the rules and regulations --"
145,KIRK,145,And who am I hiding from?
146,BONES,146,"From yourself, Admiral."
147,KIRK,147,"Don't mince words, Bones; tell
me what you really think."
148,BONES,148,"I'm your doctor and I'm your friend,
Jim. Get back your command. Get it
back before you really do grow old.
Before you turn into part of this
collection."
149,TERRELL,149,"Are you sure these are the
coordinates?"
150,CHEKOV,150,"Captain, this is the garden spot
of Ceti Alpha VI --"
151,TERRELL,151,I can hardly see --
152,CHEKOV,152,"There's nothing, let's go --"
153,TERRELL,153,They look like cargo carriers...
154,TERRELL,154,What is it?
155,CHEKOV,155,"A face! I saw -- it was like a
child --"
156,TERRELL,156,You're crazy -- !
157,CHEKOV,157,I saw it -- !
158,TERRELL,158,There's an air-lock.
159,TERRELL,159,There's breathable atmosphere in here.
160,TERRELL,160,"What the hell is this? Did they
crash? Where's the rest of the
ship?"
161,CHEKOV,161,I told you! I told you I saw a --
162,TERRELL,162,Ssssh!
163,"CHEKOV
Botany Bay",163,-- oh no!
164,TERRELL,164,What's the matter -- ?
165,CHEKOV,165,"Captain, we've got to get out of
here --"
166,TERRELL,166,But the child --
167,CHEKOV,167,Never mind! Hurry!
168,BEACH,168,Try again.
169,KYLE,169,"Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell
... This is Lieutenant Kyle. Will
you please respond, Captain...
Captain Terrell, respond please."
170,BEACH,170,"Let's give them a little more
time."
171,CHEKOV,171,Khan!
172,KHAN,172,"I don't know you. But you. I never
forget a face. Mister Chekov,
isn't it?"
173,KHAN,173,"I never thought to see your face
again."
174,TERRELL,174,"Chekov, who is this man?"
175,CHEKOV,175,"A criminal, Captain -- a product of
the late 20th Century genetic
engineering --"
176,TERRELL,176,What do you want with us? I demand --
177,KHAN,177,"You are in a position to demand
nothing, sir. I, on the other hand,
am in a position to grant nothing.
What you see is all that remains of
the ship's company and the crew of the"
178,"Botany Bay
, marooned here fifteen",178,years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
179,TERRELL,179,Listen to me -- you men and women --
180,KHAN,180,"Save your strength, Captain, these
people have sworn to live and die at
my command two hundred years before
you were born. Do you mean he..."
181,KHAN,181,"... never told you the tale?
To amuse you, Captain? Never told
you how the"
182,Enterprise,182,picked up the
183,"Botany Bay
, lost in space from the",183,"year 1996, myself and the ship's
company in cryogenic freeze?"
184,TERRELL,184,I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
185,KHAN,185,Admiral? He didn't tell you how
186,Admiral,186,"Kirk sent seventy of us into
exile on this barren sand heap with
only the contents of these cargo bays
to sustain us?"
187,CHEKOV,187,"You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was
life, a fair chance to --"
188,"KHAN
This is Ceti Alpha V
! Ceti Alpha VI",188,"exploded six months after we were
left here. The shock shifted the
orbit of"
189,this,189,"planet and everything
was laid waste."
190,Admiral,190,"Kirk never
bothered to check on our progress.
It was only the fact of my genetically
engineered intellect that enabled us
to survive! On earth, two hundred
years ago, I was a prince, with power
over millions -- now, like Prometheus
I have been left by Admiral Kirk to
digest my own entrails."
191,CHEKOV,191,"Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid
his hospitality by trying to steal his
ship and murder him."
192,KHAN,192,"And I'll wager he never told you
about his shipmate, the beautiful
and courageous Lieutenant McGiver,
who gave up everything to join me
in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how"
193,Admiral Kirk,193,"requited her devotion --
She's dead as earth!"
194,KHAN,194,A plague upon you all.
195,KHAN,195,"You didn't expect to find me.
You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.
Why are you here?"
196,KHAN,196,Why?
197,KHAN,197,No matter.
198,KHAN,198,"You will soon tell me willingly
enough."
199,KHAN,199,"Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's
only remaining indigenous life form;
what do you think? They've killed
twenty of my people, including my
beloved wife. Oh, not all at once
and not instantly, to be sure. Their
young enter through the ears and wrap
themselves around the cerebral cortex.
This has the effect of rendering the
victim"
200,extremely,200,"susceptible to
suggestion. Later, as they grow,
follows madness, paralysis -- and
death. These are pets, of course --
not"
201,quite,201,domesticated.
202,CHEKOV,202,"Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk
was only doing his duty! You --"
203,KHAN,203,"There is some pain at first, I am
told, and then the effects are quite
benign -- until the end. That was
what I learned from watching my wife."
204,KHAN,204,"That's better! Now: tell me why
you are here -- and tell me where I
may find James Kirk."
205,KYLE,205,"Captain Terrell. Captain Terrell...
This is Reliant; please respond."
206,BEACH,206,"Mr. Kyle, muster a landing party
with full arms. Alert the
transporter room. We're beaming
down."
207,TERRELL'S VOICE,207,"Reliant, this is Terrell. Respond
please."
208,BEACH,208,"This is Reliant. Clark, are you
all right?"
209,TERRELL'S VOICE,209,"Everything's fine, commander. I'll
explain when I see you. Oh, by the
way, we're bringing several guests
aboard. Prepare to beam up on my
next signal. Terrell out."
210,KYLE,210,Guests?
211,BEACH,211,Maybe we ARE transplanting something.
212,SULU,212,"Enterprise, this is Admiral Kirk's
party on final approach."
213,ENTERPRISE VOICE,213,"Enterprise welcomes you. Prepare
for docking."
214,KIRK,214,I really must thank you.
215,SULU,215,"I am delighted; any chance to go
aboard Enterprise, however briefly,
is always an excuse for nostalgia."
216,KIRK,216,"I cut your new orders personally. By
the end of the month, you'll have your
first command: USS EXCELSIOR."
217,SULU,217,"Thank you, sir. I've looked
forward to this for a long time."
218,KIRK,218,"You've earned it. But I'm still
grateful to have you at the helm
for three weeks. I don't believe
these kids can steer."
219,INTERCOM VOICE,219,Docking procedure complete.
220,SPOCK,220,Prepare for Admiral's inspection.
221,SPOCK,221,Open the Air Lock.
222,KIRK,222,"Permission to come aboard, Captain?"
223,SPOCK,223,"Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe
you know my trainee crew. Certainly
they have come to know you."
224,KIRK,224,"Yes, we've been through death and
life together."
225,KIRK,225,"Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're
well?"
226,SCOTTY,226,"I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy
pulled me through."
227,KIRK,227,"Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?"
228,BONES,228,"Shore leave, Admiral."
229,KIRK,229,Ah.
230,KIRK,230,And who is this?
231,PRESTON,231,"Midshipman First Class Peter Preston,
engineers mate, SIR."
232,KIRK,232,"Your first training voyage, Mr.
Preston?"
233,PRESTON,233,"Yes, SIR."
234,KIRK,234,"I see. Well, shall we start with
the engine room?"
235,SCOTTY,235,I believe you'll find all in order --
236,SPOCK,236,"We'll see you on the bridge, Admiral."
237,KIRK,237,"Very good, Mr. Spock."
238,SAAVIK,238,"He's not what I expected, Sir."
239,SPOCK,239,"What did you expect, Lieutenant?"
240,SAAVIK,240,He's very human.
241,SPOCK,241,"We can't all be perfect, Saavik.
You must control your prejudices
and remember that as a Vulcan as
well as a Romulan you are forever
a stranger in an alien land.
Around you are humans, and as a
member of the Starfleet you are
unlikely ever to escape their
presence or their influence.
You must learn to tolerance in addition
to all else I have taught you.
Tolerance is logical."
242,SAAVIK,242,"As always, my mentor. Company dismiss."
243,PRESTON,243,"I believe you'll find everything
shipshape, Admiral."
244,KIRK,244,"Oh do you? Have you any idea,
Midshipman Preston, how many times
I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on
the Comm, telling me his troubles?
Have you any idea the ribbing I've
had to endure in the officers' mess
to the effect that the Enterprise
is a flying death trap?"
245,PRESTON,245,"Oh, no, sir! This is the finest
engine room in the whole Star --"
246,PRESTON,246,"If the Admiral can't see the facts
for himself, then, with all due
respect, he's as blind as a Tiberion
bat. SIR."
247,KIRK,247,"Midshipman, you're a tiger."
248,SCOTTY,248,"My sister's youngest, Admiral.
Crazy to get to space."
249,KIRK,249,"Every young boy's fancy. I seem
to remember it myself."
250,KIRK,250,"Very well. Mr. Scott, are your
engines capable of handling a minor
training cruise?"
251,SCOTTY,251,"Give the word, Admiral."
252,KIRK,252,"Mr. Scott, the word is given."
253,SCOTTY,253,"Aye, sir."
254,BONES,254,"What about the rest of the
inspection, Admiral?"
255,KIRK,255,"The inspection will continue once
we're underway, Doctor."
256,INTERCOM VOICE,256,"This is Starfleet operations.
Enterprise is cleared for departure."
257,SULU,257,Admiral on the bridge!
258,SPOCK,258,"Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all
moorings."
259,SAAVIK,259,"Aye, sir."
260,SAAVIK,260,"All moorings are clear, Captain."
261,SPOCK,261,"Thank you, Mr. Saavik."
262,SPOCK,262,"Lieutenant, how many times have you
piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?"
263,SAAVIK,263,"Never, sir."
264,SPOCK,264,"Take her out, Mr. Saavik."
265,SAAVIK,265,"Aye, sir."
266,SPOCK,266,"There's a first time for everything,
Admiral."
267,KIRK,267,"To be sure, Captain."
268,SAAVIK,268,"Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu."
269,SULU,269,"Aft thrusters, sir."
270,SAAVIK,270,Ahead one quarter impulse power.
271,BONES,271,Would you like a tranquilizer?
272,SULU,272,Ahead one quarter impulse power.
273,SULU,273,We are clear and free to navigate.
274,SAAVIK,274,"Course heading, Captain?"
275,KIRK,275,Captain's discretion.
276,SPOCK,276,"Mr. Sulu, you may follow your nose."
277,JOACHIM,277,Steady on course. All systems normal.
278,KHAN,278,"It's not much different from
Enterprise."
279,KHAN,279,"When I was a guest aboard her some
years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed
me to memorize her technical manuals.
And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review:
You say you have no details of
Project 'Genesis' ?"
280,CHEKOV,280,"Beyond what I told you, sir, it is
classified information."
281,KHAN,281,"Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have
access to such information?"
282,CHEKOV,282,"I would think so, sir. He's on the
Fleet General Staff."
283,KHAN,283,"Then to whom do you report directly
regarding Genesis?"
284,CHEKOV,284,"To Doctor Marcus, the civilian
director of the experiments on Space
Laboratory Regula I."
285,KHAN,285,I see. Helmsman?
286,HELMSMAN,286,"Aye, sir."
287,JOACHIM,287,"May I speak? We're all with you,
sir, but consider: we are free,
we have a ship and the means to
go where we will. We have
escaped permanent exile on Ceti
Alpha V. You have proved your
superior intellect and defeated
the plans of Admiral Kirk.
You do not need to defeat him
again."
288,KHAN,288,"He tasks me -- and I'll have him. I'll
chase him round the moons of Nibia
and round the Antares maelstrom and
round perdition's flames before I give
him up."
289,KHAN,289,"Prepare to alter course -- for Space
Station Regula I."
290,DAVID,290,Does that about do it?
291,CAROL,291,"I don't think there's another piece
of information we could squeeze
into the memory banks. Next
time, we'll design a bigger
one."
292,DAVID,292,Who --
293,JEDDA,293,"Comm-Pic coming in on hyperchannel
... It's Reliant."
294,CAROL,294,"On the screen, please, Jedda."
295,CHEKOV,295,"... come in, please. This is Reliant
calling Regula I. Repeat. This is
USS Reliant --"
296,CAROL,296,"Commander, we are receiving. This
is Regula I. Go ahead."
297,CHEKOV,297,"Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route
to you and should be there in three
days."
298,CAROL,298,"En route? Why? We weren't expecting
you for another three months. Has
something happened?"
299,"Has something happened
? Do you read",299,us?
300,CHEKOV,300,"All went well. Nothing has happened.
Ceti Alpha VI has checked out."
301,CAROL,301,I still don't under --
302,CHEKOV,302,"We have received new orders. Upon our
arrival at Regula I, all materials of
Project Genesis will be transferred to
this ship for immediate testing at
Ceti Alpha VI."
303,"CAROL
Will you please be quiet",303,"Commander Chekov, this is completely
irregular. Who gave the order you
are quoting? Who gave the order?"
304,CHEKOV,304,"The order comes from Starfleet
command, Dr. Marcus, direct from
the General Staff."
305,CAROL,305,"But Genesis is a civilian project,
under my control --"
306,CHEKOV,306,I have my orders.
307,DAVID,307,"Pin him down, mother! Who gave the
orders!?"
308,CHEKOV,308,"The orders come from Admiral James
T. Kirk."
309,DAVID,309,"I knew it! I knew it! All along
the military has wanted to get their
hands on this --"
310,CAROL,310,"This is completely improper,
Commander Chekov. I have no
intention of allowing Reliant or
any other unauthorized personnel
access to our work or materials."
311,CHEKOV,311,"I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor.
Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.
Please prepare to deliver Genesis to
us upon our arrival. Reliant out."
312,CAROL,312,Commander Chekov -- !
313,KHAN,313,"Well done, Commander."
314,CHEKOV,314,"You realize, sir, that they will
attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and
confirm the order."
315,CAROL,315,"Will you please be quiet! We must
have order here."
316,CAROL,316,This has to be some sort of mistake.
317,DAVID,317,"Mistake? We're all alone here.
They waited until everyone was on
shift-leave to do this. Reliant is
supposed to be at our disposal, not
vice-versa."
318,MADISON,318,"It seems clear that Starfleet never
intended that --"
319,CAROL,319,"I know, but --"
320,DAVID,320,"I've tried to warn you. Scientists
are always pawns of the military --"
321,CAROL,321,"Starfleet has kept the peace for
a hundred years, I cannot and
will not subscribe to your
interpretation of this event."
322,JEDDA,322,"You may be right, Doctor, but what
about Reliant? She's on her way."
323,CAROL,323,"Get your gear together where it's
handy."
324,MARCH,324,Where are we going?
325,CAROL,325,"That's for us to know and Reliant
to find out. We have only three
days. Let's not waste time."
326,SAAVIK'S VOICE,326,Hold please -- !
327,SAAVIK,327,"Thank you, sir."
328,KIRK,328,"Lieutenant, are you wearing your
hair differently?"
329,SAAVIK,329,"It is still regulation, Admiral."
330,SAAVIK,330,"May I speak, sir?"
331,KIRK,331,"Lieutenant, self-expression does not
seem to be one of your problems."
332,SAAVIK,332,"I wish to thank you for the high
efficiency rating."
333,KIRK,333,You earned it.
334,SAAVIK,334,I did not think so.
335,KIRK,335,"You're bothered by your performance
on the"
336,"Kobayashi Maru
SAAVIK",336,I failed to resolve the situation.
337,KIRK,337,"There is no correct resolution.
It is a test of character."
338,SAAVIK,338,May I ask how
339,you,339,"dealt with the
test?"
340,KIRK,340,"You may ask, Lieutenant."
341,KIRK,341,That was a little joke.
342,SAAVIK,342,"Humor... that is a difficult concept
... it is not logical..."
343,KIRK,343,"We learn by doing, Lieutenant."
344,KIRK,344,You want my advice?
345,SAAVIK,345,Yes.
346,KIRK,346,Take the test again.
347,BONES,347,"Who's been holding up the damn
elevator?"
348,SAAVIK,348,"Thank you, sir."
349,BONES,349,Has she changed her hairstyle?
350,BONES,350,"Wonderful stuff, that Romulan
ale --"
351,UHURA'S VOICE,351,Admiral Kirk --
352,KIRK,352,Kirk here.
353,UHURA'S VOICE,353,"I have an urgent CommPic from Space
Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr.
Carol Marcus."
354,KIRK,354,"In my quarters, Uhura."
355,UHURA'S VOICE,355,"Yes, sir."
356,BONES,356,It never rains but when it pours --
357,KIRK,357,"As a physician you of all people
should appreciate the danger of
re-opening old wounds."
358,BONES,358,Sorry.
359,KIRK,359,Uhura. Can't you augment?
360,UHURA,360,"I'm trying, sir. Stand by..."
361,CAROL,361,Jim... read me? Can you read me?
362,KIRK,362,"Message breaking up, Carol. What's
wrong? What's wrong?"
363,CAROL,363,... Can't read you... repeat...
364,KIRK,364,"Repeat... what's wrong? What's
wrong?"
365,CAROL,365,... taking Genesis away from us...
366,KIRK,366,"Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking
Genesis?"
367,CAROL,367,"... see you but can't hear. Did
you... order...?"
368,KIRK,368,What order? Who's taking Genesis?
369,CAROL,369,"... Please help us, Jim... won't
let them have... without proper...
repeat... on whose authority..."
370,KIRK,370,Carol!
371,CAROL,371,Jim please --
372,KIRK,372,"Uhura! What's happening? Damn
it..."
373,UHURA'S VOICE,373,"Transmission jammed at the source,
sir."
374,KIRK,374,"Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters.
I want to talk with Starfleet
Command."
375,KIRK,375,Stop engines.
376,SULU,376,Stop engines.
377,KIRK,377,"An emergency situation has arisen.
By order of Starfleet Command, as
of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming
command of this vessel. Duty officer
so note in the ship's log. Plot a
new course: for Space Laboratory
Regula I."
378,KIRK,378,Mr. Scott?
379,SCOTTY'S VOICE,379,"Aye, sir."
380,KIRK,380,We'll be going to warp speed --
381,SCOTTY'S VOICE,381,"Aye, sir --"
382,SULU,382,"Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral..."
383,KIRK,383,Engage warp engines --
384,SAAVIK,384,Prepare for warp speed.
385,SULU,385,"Ready, sir."
386,KIRK,386,"Mr. Sulu, go to Warp 5."
387,KIRK,387,We've got a problem.
388,KIRK,388,"Something may be wrong at Regula
I. We've been ordered to investigate."
389,SPOCK,389,"Regula I is a scientific research
laboratory, if memory serves..."
390,KIRK,390,"I told Starfleet all we had was a
boatload of children but we're the
only ship in the quadrant. Spock:
those cadets of yours -- how good
are they? How will they respond
under real pressure?"
391,SPOCK,391,"Like all living beings, Admiral
each according to his gifts. The
ship is yours."
392,KIRK,392,"That won't be necessary: just take
me to Regula I."
393,SPOCK,393,"Excuse my presumption, but I do not
agree. As a teacher on a training
mission, I am content to command a
Starship. If we are to go on actual
duty, it is clear that the senior
officer aboard must assume command."
394,KIRK,394,"But it may be nothing; garbled
communications. Why don't you..."
395,SPOCK,395,"You proceed from a false assumption.
I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise."
396,KIRK,396,"You are going to remind me that
logic alone dictates your actions."
397,SPOCK,397,"I was going to remind you of nothing,
least of all that which you know well."
398,SPOCK,398,"Your mistake, if I may be so bold,
was promotion. Commanding a Starship
is your first best destiny. Anything
else is a waste of material."
399,KIRK,399,I would not presume to debate you.
400,SPOCK,400,"That is wise. In any case, were I
to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates
that the needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few."
401,KIRK,401,Or the one.
402,SPOCK,402,"You are my superior officer. You
are also my friend. I have been
and always shall be yours."
403,KIRK,403,Will you accompany me to the bridge?
404,SPOCK,404,"I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first
so that he may, in his own words,
explain the situation to his cadets."
405,UHURA'S VOICE,405,"Regula I, this is Enterprise. This
is Enterprise calling. Do you
receive... I say..."
406,UHURA,406,"... Again, this is Enterprise calling
Space Lab Regula I. Come in, please.
Dr. Marcus. Please respond, please
-- it's no use; no response from
Regula I."
407,SPOCK,407,But no longer jammed?
408,UHURA,408,"No, sir. No nothing."
409,SPOCK,409,"There are two possibilities, sir
they are unwilling to respond, they
are unable to respond."
410,KIRK,410,How far?
411,SPOCK,411,"Twelve hours and forty-three
minutes, present speed."
412,KIRK,412,"Give up Genesis, she said. What in
God's name does that mean? Give it
up to whom?"
413,SPOCK,413,"It might help my analysis if I knew
what Genesis was."
414,KIRK,414,"Uhura, ask Dr. McCoy to join us in
my quarters. Mr. Saavik, take the
con."
415,BONES,415,"I've got the sick bay ready. Will
someone please tell me what is going
on?"
416,KIRK,416,"Computer. Request security procedure
and access to Project Genesis
Summary."
417,COMPUTER VOICE,417,Identify for retina scan.
418,KIRK,418,"Kirk, Admiral James T., Starfleet
General Staff. Security Class 1."
419,KIRK,419,"Summary, please."
420,SPOCK,420,Carol Marcus --
421,KIRK,421,Yes.
422,CAROL,422,"I'm Dr. Carol Marcus, and I am
the director of the Project
Genesis team at Regula I. What
exactly IS Genesis? Put simply,
Genesis is a procedure whereby
the molecular structure of any
given matter can be restructured
-- changed -- into anything else
of identical mass."
423,SPOCK,423,Fascinating.
424,KIRK,424,Wait --
425,CAROL,425,"Stage One of our experiments
was conducted in the labora-
tory. Stage Two of the series
will be attempted in a lifeless
underground; Stage Three will
involve the process on a plane-
tary scale. What follows is a
computer projected simulation
of Stage Three. Please watch
closely."
426,CAROL,426,"It is our intention to introduce
what we call the Genesis device
or ""torpedo"" into the targeted
area of a lifeless space body,
a moon or other inert form --
the device is fired --"
427,CAROL,427,"-- Unleashing, almost instantan-
eously, what we call the Genesis
effect. Particulate matter is
reorganized and electrified --
with life introduced results.
Instead of a dead moon, a living
breathing planet, capable of sus-
taining whatever life forms we
see fit to deposit on it... The
reformed object you see represents
the merest fraction of the Genesis
potential, should the Federation
wish to pursue these experiments to
their logical conclusion."
428,CAROL,428,"When we consider the problems of
population and food supply, the
usefulness of this process begins
to become clear.
This concludes this demonstration
tape. Thank you for your attention.
The Genesis team eagerly awaits the
decision of the Federation regarding
the next phase of our work."
429,SPOCK,429,It literally is Genesis...
430,KIRK,430,The power of creation --
431,SPOCK,431,"Have they proceeded with their
experiments?"
432,KIRK,432,"The tape was made a year ago. I
can only assume they've reached
Phase Two by now --"
433,BONES,433,"But dear Lord, are we intelligent
enough to -- Suppose, this
thing were used where life already
exists?"
434,SPOCK,434,"It would destroy such life in favor
of its new matrix --"
435,BONES,435,"It's new -- have you any idea what
you're saying?"
436,SPOCK,436,"I was not attempting to evaluate
its moral implications, Doctor.
As a matter of cosmic history, it
has always been easier to destroy
than to create --"
437,BONES,437,"Not anymore! Now you can do both
at the same time! According to myth,
the earth was created in six days.
Watch out: here comes Genesis;
we'll do it for you in six minutes --"
438,SPOCK,438,"I don't dispute that in the wrong
hands --"
439,BONES,439,"Would you like to tell me whose
are the"
440,right,440,"hands, my cold-blooded
friend? Are you in favor of these
experiments?"
441,KIRK,441,"Gentlemen, this isn't --"
442,SPOCK,442,"Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban
the acquisition of knowledge
because you distrust the moral
implications of what you learn.
Logic suggests --"
443,BONES,443,Logic??
444,"We're talking about
universal Armageddon
, you inhuman",444,bloodless...
445,SAAVIK'S VOICE,445,"Admiral, sensors indicate a vessel
in our area, closing fast."
446,KIRK,446,What do you make of her?
447,SAAVIK'S VOICE,447,"It's one of ours, Admiral... It's
Reliant."
448,SPOCK,448,What's she doing here?
449,KIRK,449,"Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?"
450,UHURA,450,She's not responding...
451,KIRK,451,Try the emergency channels...
452,UHURA,452,"Enterprise to Reliant. Come in,
Reliant."
453,KIRK,453,"Picture, Mr. Saavik."
454,SPOCK,454,Attempt visual communication.
455,UHURA,455,"Yes, sir."
456,KIRK,456,"Is it possible their COMM system
has failed -- ?"
457,SPOCK,457,It would explain a great many things --
458,KHAN,458,"Slow to one-half impulse power.
Let's be friends..."
459,HELMSMAN,459,Slowing to one-half impulse.
460,JOACHIM,460,"They're requesting visual
communications, sir."
461,KHAN,461,Let them eat static.
462,JOACHIM,462,They're still running with shields down.
463,KHAN,463,"Of course. We're one big happy fleet.
Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know
the Klingon proverb that tells us
revenge is a dish that is best
served cold?"
464,KHAN,464,It is very cold in space.
465,SULU,465,"Reliant in our section this quadrant,
sir, and slowing --"
466,KIRK,466,Visual.
467,SAAVIK,467,"Sir, may I quote General Order 12:
'On the approach of any vessel, when
communications have not been est --"
468,SPOCK,468,"Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware
of the Regulations."
469,SAAVIK,469,"Aye, sir."
470,KIRK,470,This is damned peculiar.
471,KIRK,471,Yellow alert.
472,SAAVIK,472,Energize defense fields.
473,UHURA,473,"I'm getting a voice message... wait
... short range band. They say their
Chambers coil is shorting their COMM
system."
474,KIRK,474,Spock?
475,SPOCK,475,Scanning...
476,JOACHIM,476,"They still haven't raised their
shields."
477,KHAN,477,Careful: Not all at once.
478,"The
engine room
. Lock on target and",478,prepare to fire.
479,JOACHIM,479,Locking phasers on target.
480,SPOCK,480,"Their coil emissions are normal...
Wait: their shields are going up.
They're locking phasers -- !"
481,KIRK,481,"Raise shields! Energize phasers,
stand by to --"
482,SCOTTY,482,"Respirators! Get back! Use your
respirators!"
483,KIRK,483,Mr. Sulu... The shields!
484,SULU,484,"Trying, sir!"
485,INTERCOM VOICE,485,Medical Alert: Engine Room.
486,SULU,486,"I can't get power, sir!"
487,KIRK,487,Scotty!
488,KIRK,488,"Uhura, turn off those damn
channels!!"
489,UHURA,489,Mr. Scott on discrete.
490,KIRK,490,"Scotty, let's have it."
491,SCOTTY,491,"Just hanging on, sir. Main energizers
out."
492,SPOCK,492,They knew just where to hit us.
493,KIRK,493,"WHO? Who knew just where to hit
us? And"
494,"why
SPOCK",494,"One thing is certain; we cannot
escape on auxiliary power."
495,KIRK,495,Visual!
496,KIRK,496,"Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the
phasers --"
497,SPOCK,497,Too late --
498,KIRK,498,Hang on!
499,KIRK,499,Scotty -- what's left?
500,SCOTTY'S VOICE,500,"Just the batteries, sir. I can have
auxiliary power in a few minutes --"
501,KIRK,501,"We don't have minutes. Can you
give me phaser power?"
502,SCOTTY'S VOICE,502,"A few shots, sir."
503,SPOCK,503,Not enough against their shields.
504,KIRK,504,Who the
505,hell,505,are they?
506,UHURA,506,"Admiral... Commander Reliant is
signaling."
507,UHURA,507,"He wishes to discuss terms of our
surrender."
508,KIRK,508,On screen.
509,UHURA,509,Admiral --
510,KIRK,510,"Do it, while we have time."
511,KIRK,511,Khan!
512,SAAVIK,512,Who?
513,KHAN,513,"You still remember, Admiral. I
cannot help but be touched. Of
course, I remember you."
514,KIRK,514,"What is the meaning of this attack?
Where is the crew of the Reliant?"
515,KHAN,515,"Surely I have made my meaning plain.
I mean to avenge myself upon you,
Admiral. I've deprived your ship of
power and when I swing round I mean
to deprive you of your life --"
516,KHAN,516,"-- But I wanted you to know first
who it was who had beaten you: I,
Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you
attempted to cage forever."
517,KIRK,517,"Khan, listen to me -- if its me you
want, I'll have myself beamed aboard.
All I ask is that you spare my crew."
518,KHAN,518,"That is a most intriguing offer.
Typical, I must say of your sterling
character. Let me think."
519,KHAN,519,"I make you a counter-proposal, I will
agree to your terms, if in addition
to yourself, you turn over to me all
data and material regarding the
project called Genesis."
520,KIRK,520,"Genesis, what's that?"
521,KHAN,521,"Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is
on the phaser control --"
522,KIRK,522,"Give me some time to recall the data
on our computers --"
523,KHAN,523,"I give you sixty seconds, Admiral."
524,SPOCK,524,"Admiral, you can't give him Genesis..."
525,KIRK,525,"At least we know he hasn't got it.
Just keep nodding as though I'm
giving orders. Saavik, punch up the
data charts of Reliant's command
console -- hurry..."
526,SAAVIK,526,Reliant's command...
527,KIRK,527,HURRY.
528,SPOCK,528,The prefix code?
529,KIRK,529,It's all we've got.
530,SAAVIK,530,On screen...
531,KIRK,531,We're finding it.
532,KIRK,532,"Please,"
533,please,533,"-- you've got to
give us time -- the bridge is
smashed, computers inoperative..."
534,KHAN,534,"Time is a luxury you do not have,
Admiral: forty-five seconds..."
535,SAAVIK,535,I don't understand --
536,KIRK,536,"You've got to learn WHY things
work on a Starship."
537,KIRK,537,"It's coming through now, Khan..."
538,SPOCK,538,"The prefix code is 16309. All
commands from each Starship bridge
are relayed electronically; each
ship has its own prefix combination
code..."
539,KHAN,539,Thirty seconds...
540,KIRK,540,"... to prevent an enemy from doing
just what we're attempting; using"
541,our,541,"console to tap in a message,
an order to lower Reliant's damn
shields..."
542,SPOCK,542,"Let's hope he hasn't changed the
combination. He's quite intelligent..."
543,KIRK,543,"Wait for my signal, Spock -- too
soon and he'll have time to figure
it out and raise them again."
544,KIRK,544,"Khan, how do I know you'll keep
your word?"
545,KHAN,545,"I've given you no word to keep,
Admiral. In my judgment, you simply
have no alternative."
546,KIRK,546,"I take your point. Stand by to
receive our transmission."
547,KIRK,547,"Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target
and await my command..."
548,SULU,548,Phasers locked...
549,KHAN,549,"Time's up, Admiral..."
550,KIRK,550,"Here it comes. Now, Spock."
551,JOACHIM,551,Sir -- our shields are dropping!
552,KHAN,552,Raise them --
553,JOACHIM,553,They won't --
554,KIRK,554,FIRE!
555,KHAN,555,"At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE!
Why can't you?"
556,JOACHIM,556,"We can't fire, sir; they've damaged
the photon controls and the warp
drive. We must withdraw!"
557,KHAN,557,No!
558,JOACHIM,558,"Sir, we must!"
559,JOACHIM,559,"We must repair the damage. Enterprise
will wait; she's not going anywhere."
560,SULU,560,"Sir, you did it."
561,I did nothing,561,"-- except get caught
with my britches down. I must be
senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep
right on quoting regulations.
Meantime, let's find out what the
hell is going on and see how bad
we've been --"
562,CREW CHIEF,562,Hit your blowers!
563,PRESTON,563,Is the word given?
564,KIRK,564,The word is given: warp speed.
565,PRESTON,565,Aye...
566,"SCOTTY
WHY
KIRK",566,"He wants to kill me for passing
sentence on him 14 years ago -- and
he doesn't care who stands between
him and his vengeance."
567,BONES,567,"Scotty, I'm sorry..."
568,SCOTTY,568,"He stayed at his post. When the
trainees ran, he stayed."
569,KIRK,569,"If he hadn't, we'd be space by now."
570,SPOCK'S VOICE,570,"Admiral, this is Spock."
571,KIRK,571,"Yes, Spock."
572,SPOCK'S VOICE,572,"Engine room reports auxiliary power
restored. We can proceed at impulse
power."
573,KIRK,573,"Best speed to Regula I. Kirk
out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any
chance of getting the mains back on
the line?"
574,SCOTTY,574,"I dinna think so, sir, but you'll
have my best --"
575,SCOTTY,575,"Thanks -- I know you tried, Doctor..."
576,KIRK,576,Are you all right?
577,BONES,577,"Doctors lose patients sometimes.
Damn. I'm"
578,still,578,"in the dark: How'd
he know about Genesis?"
579,KIRK,579,"At the moment that question takes
a back seat to preventing him from
laying his hands on it. You said it
yourself; we're talking about a bang
that would re-arrange the universe..."
580,BONES,580,"There may still be time... you gave
as good as you got."
581,KIRK,581,"I got beat. We're only alive because
I knew something about these ships
that he didn't."
582,SULU (V.O.),582,"Approaching Regula and Space Lab
Regula I."
583,KIRK,583,Try again.
584,UHURA,584,"Space Station Regular I, this is
Starship Enterprise. Come in, please..."
585,UHURA,585,"I say again. Space Station Regular.
This is Starship Enterprise. Please
respond. Please respond."
586,UHURA,586,"... No response, sir."
587,KIRK,587,"Sensors, Captain?"
588,SPOCK,588,"Scanners and sensors still inoperative.
There's no way to tell what's  inside
the station."
589,KIRK,589,"And no way of knowing if Reliant
is still in the area..."
590,SPOCK,590,"Affirmative, Admiral."
591,KIRK,591,"... Blind as a Tiberian Bat.
What do you make of the plantoid
beyond?"
592,SPOCK,592,"Regula is class ""D'. It consists of
various remarkable ores. Essentially,
a great rock in space."
593,KIRK,593,Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
594,SPOCK,594,A distinct possibility.
595,KIRK,595,"Engine room... Scotty, do we have
enough power for the transporters?"
596,SCOTTY'S VOICE,596,"Just barely, sir."
597,KIRK,597,I'm going down to the station.
598,BONES,598,Khan could be down there!
599,KIRK,599,"He's BEEN there and hasn't found
what he wants. Can you spare
someone? There may be people
hurt."
600,BONES,600,I can spare me...
601,SAAVIK,601,"Begging the Admiral's pardon:
General Order 15: 'No  flag officer
shall beam into a hazardous area
without armed escort.'"
602,KIRK,602,There is no such regulation.
603,KIRK,603,"All right, join the party.
Mr. Spock, the ship is yours."
604,SPOCK,604,Aye sir --
605,KIRK,605,"Establish a parking orbit around
the station and send me a complete
damage report when you've talked
with Mr. Scott."
606,SPOCK,606,"Be careful, Jim..."
607,KIRK,607,Hello...! Anybody here?
608,SAAVIK,608,Indeterminate life signs.
609,KIRK,609,Phasers on stun. Move out.
610,KIRK,610,They even killed the galley chief.
611,BONES,611,"This one looks like a Steward.
They're not warm, but rigor hasn't
set in. This didn't happen all that
long ago, Jim."
612,KIRK,612,Carol...
613,UHURA'S VOICE,613,"Admiral Kirk, Enterprise. Come in,
please. Come in please."
614,KIRK,614,My God!
615,BONES,615,"That's Clark Terrell, Jim, I've
served with him."
616,BONES,616,"Brain disturbance. Appears to be
drug induced."
617,KIRK,617,"Saavik, for God's sake, tell her
we're all right."
618,UHURA,618,"I say again. This is Enterprise.
Please acknowledge signal. Please --"
619,SAAVIK,619,"Commander Uhura, this is Lt. Saavik.
We're all right. Please stand by.
Out."
620,UHURA,620,"Aye, aye."
621,CHEKOV,621,"Oh, God, Admiral...!"
622,BONES,622,"It's Dr. McCoy, Captain. Do you
remember me?"
623,TERRELL,623,"McCoy? Yes. Oh, yes."
624,CHEKOV,624,"Oh, sir. It was Khan! We found him
on Ceti Alpha V."
625,KIRK,625,"Easy, Pavel... Tell me what you
can..."
626,CHEKOV,626,"No life signs -- but he was there.
Captured us. He -- he put creatures
in our bodies. To control our minds."
627,BONES,627,"It's all right, you're safe..."
628,CHEKOV,628,"... Made us say -- lies... Do...
things... But we beat him... The
Captain and me. -- He thought he
controlled us, but he didn't ...
The Captain was strong."
629,KIRK,629,"Captain. Where is Dr. Marcus?
Where are the Genesis materials?"
630,TERRELL,630,"He couldn't find them. Some of
the scientists were still here,
but everything else, even the data
banks -- were empty."
631,SAAVIK,631,"That's true, Admiral. All the
memory cells have been emptied."
632,KIRK,632,Erased...
633,TERRELL,633,"He tortured those people. None of
them would tell him anything. He
went wild, strung them up and slit
their throats. He wanted to tear
the place apart, but he was late:
he had to get back to Reliant in
time to blow you to bits."
634,KIRK,634,He came damn close...
635,CHEKOV,635,He left us.
636,CHEKOV,636,We were no longer of use.
637,SAAVIK,637,Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
638,TERRELL,638,"Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's
completely mad, Admiral. He blames
you for the death of his wife..."
639,KIRK,639,I know what he blames me for.
640,KIRK,640,The escape pods are all in place.
641,KIRK,641,Where's the transporter room?
642,KIRK,642,Did he make it down here?
643,CHEKOV,643,"It was not my impression. He spent
most of his time trying to wring the
information out of the people."
644,SAAVIK,644,Anything?
645,KIRK,645,"Somebody left the unit on. If
everyone else was dead, it implies
that no one remained to turn it off.
Those people back there bought escape
time for Genesis with their lives."
646,SAAVIK,646,"It doesn't make sense. These
coordinates are well within
Regula -- a plantoid we know to be
lifeless and airless."
647,KIRK,647,"If Stage Two was completed, it was
underground -- she said it was going
to be underground."
648,SAAVIK,648,Stage Two of what?
649,KIRK,649,"Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report,
Spock?"
650,SPOCK'S VOICE,650,"Admiral, if we go by the book, like
Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem
like days."
651,KIRK,651,"I read you, Captain. Let's have it."
652,SPOCK'S VOICE,652,"The situation is grave, Admiral. We
won't have main power for"
653,six days,653,"at least. Auxiliary power has
temporarily failed, but maybe we can
restore that in"
654,"two days
. By the",654,"book, Admiral."
655,KIRK,655,Meaning you can't even beam us back?
656,SPOCK'S VOICE,656,Not at present.
657,KIRK,657,"Captain Spock, if you do not hear
from us within"
658,one hour,658,"your orders
are to restore what power you can,
take the Enterprise to the nearest
Star Base and alert Starfleet
command when you are out of jamming
range."
659,UHURA'S VOICE,659,Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
660,KIRK,660,"Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
there won't be anybody behind. Kirk
out."
661,KIRK,661,"You gentleman can remain here, or..."
662,TERRELL,662,"If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd
like to share the risk."
663,KIRK,663,Very well. Let's go.
664,BONES,664,Go?
665,Where,665,are we going?
666,"Where
they",666,went. Saavik.
667,BONES,667,But what if they went -- nowhere?
668,KIRK,668,"Then this will be your big chance
to get away from it all."
669,SAAVIK,669,Ready.
670,SAAVIK,670,Admiral --
671,BONES,671,"Genesis, I presume."
672,DAVID,672,"You're the sonavabitch who
committed mass murder up there."
673,KIRK,673,I'm Admiral Kirk...
674,"DAVID
We were still there
, you dumb",674,"bastard! We could hear the screams
all the way to the transporter room --"
675,KIRK,675,Where's Dr. Marcus --
676,DAVID,676,I'm Doctor Marcus!
677,CAROL,677,David --
678,DAVID,678,"Mother, go back!"
679,CAROL,679,Jim --
680,DAVID,680,Go back. I'm going to kill him.
681,CAROL,681,"You do that and you'll have murdered
your father."
682,TERRELL,682,I'll hold onto this.
683,CAROL,683,You've got a little grey --
684,KIRK,684,Carol. Is that true?
685,KIRK,685,Why didn't you tell me?
686,DAVID,686,"She's making it up! My father was
Professor --"
687,CAROL,687,"David, you're just making this
harder --"
688,TERRELL,688,"I'm afraid it's even harder than you
think, Doctor."
689,TERRELL,689,Please don't move --
690,KIRK,690,Chekov -- !
691,CHEKOV,691,"I'm sorry, Admiral."
692,TERRELL,692,"Your excellency, have you been
listening?"
693,KHAN'S VOICE,693,"I have indeed, Captain. You have
done well..."
694,DAVID,694,I knew it -- !
695,TERRELL,695,Don't move -- any of you!
696,KHAN,696,"Captain... We're waiting. What's
the delay?"
697,TERRELL,697,"All is well, sir. You have the
coordinates to beam up Genesis..."
698,KHAN,698,"First things first, Captain. Kill
Admiral Kirk."
699,TERRELL,699,"Excellency... it is difficult.
I try to obey, but --"
700,KHAN'S VOICE,700,"Kill him, Terrell. Now."
701,KHAN'S VOICE,701,Terrell? Chekov -- !
702,BONES,702,Jim -- for God's sake!
703,KIRK,703,"Khan, you bloodsucker, they're
finished! You'll have to do your
own dirty work now. Do you hear me?"
704,KHAN,704,"Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive --
my old friend..."
705,KIRK,705,"Still, 'old friend.' You've
managed to kill just about everyone
else, but like a poor marksman, you
keep missing the target."
706,KHAN,706,Perhaps I no longer need to try.
707,DAVID,707,Let go -- he can't -- !
708,SAAVIK,708,Only half of you would get there.
709,KIRK,709,"Khan, you have Genesis, but you
don't have me! You were going to
kill me, Khan, it was your sole
purpose. You'll have to come down
here to do it! You'll have to
come down!"
710,KHAN'S VOICE,710,"I've done far worse than kill you,
Admiral. I've hurt you. And I
wish to go on hurting you. I
shall leave you, as you left me --
where no one will ever find you:
poetic justice; marooned for
eternity in the center of a dead
planet -- buried alive."
711,KIRK,711,Khan -- !
712,KHAN,712,"Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't
count on Enterprise. She can't
move. My next act will be to blow
her out of the heavens."
713,KIRK,713,KHAN!
714,KHAN,714,Well?
715,JOACHIM,715,"Warp drive still inoperative. All
other systems should be restored
shortly."
716,KHAN,716,"Excellent. We have all the time
in the world."
717,SAAVIK,717,"This is Lt. Saavik, calling Enterprise..."
718,BONES,718,He's alive!
719,KIRK,719,Pavel?
720,SAAVIK,720,"No use, Admiral, they're still
jamming all channels."
721,BONES,721,"It wouldn't make any difference.
If Enterprise obeyed orders she's
long since gone. And if she couldn't
obey, she's finished."
722,DAVID,722,"So are we, it looks like."
723,CAROL,723,"I don't understand.
Who's responsible for all this?
Who is Khan?"
724,KIRK,724,It's a long story.
725,DAVID,725,We appear to have plenty of time.
726,BONES,726,"You and your father can catch up on
things."
727,DAVID,727,"My father. I hope you realize
another man has just been killed
because of..."
728,BONES,728,"Because of you, son. You shouldn't
have tried to rush someone holding
a primed phaser. Anyway it isn't
one man dead, it's two, in case
you've lost count."
729,KIRK,729,"Do you have anything to eat? I
don't know about anyone else, but
I'm starved."
730,BONES,730,"How can you think of food at a time
like this?"
731,KIRK,731,Our first order of business is survival.
732,CAROL,732,"There's food in the Genesis cave,
enough to last a lifetime -- should
that be necessary."
733,BONES,733,We thought
734,this,734,was Genesis.
735,CAROL,735,"This? It took the Starfleet corps
of engineers ten months in space
suits to tunnel out all this. What
we did in there -- we did in a day.
David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy
and the Lieutenant our idea of food."
736,DAVID,736,But we can't just sit here -- !
737,KIRK,737,"Oh, yes we can. Is there really
something to eat?"
738,CAROL,738,David. Please.
739,DAVID,739,"This is just to give us something
to do, isn't it?"
740,DAVID,740,Come on.
741,SAAVIK,741,Admiral?
742,KIRK,742,"As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond
of saying: I like to think there
always are possibilities."
743,CAROL,743,"David was right, wasn't he? It's
just to keep them busy."
744,KIRK,744,Why? Why didn't you tell me?
745,CAROL,745,"How can you ask me that? Were we
together? Where we going to be?
You had your world and I had mine.
I wanted him in mine, not chasing
through the universe with his father."
746,CAROL,746,"He's a lot like you in many ways.
Nothing I could do about it. He's
smarter, of course; that goes without
saying. Most of Genesis is really
his."
747,CAROL,747,"This is it, isn't it? We're never
going to get out of here."
748,CAROL,748,Please. Tell me what you're feeling.
749,KIRK,749,"There's a man I haven't seen in
fifteen years who thinks he's killed
me. You show me a son who'd almost be
happy to help him. My son. My life
that could have been and wasn't. What
am I feeling? I'm feeling old --
worn out."
750,CAROL,750,"Let me show you something that will
make you feel young -- young as when
the world was new."
751,CAROL,751,He'll be all right. Come.
752,KIRK,752,You did this -- in a day?!
753,CAROL,753,"The matrix formed in a day. The
life forms grew later -- at a
wildly accelerated rate. Can I
cook or can't I?"
754,JOACHIM,754,Impulse power restored.
755,KHAN,755,"More than a match for poor
Enterprise."
756,JOACHIM,756,"Departing dark side, Regula."
757,KHAN,757,Visual --
758,KHAN,758,Where IS she?
759,DAVID,759,What are you looking at?
760,SAAVIK,760,The Admiral's son.
761,DAVID,761,Don't you believe it.
762,SAAVIK,762,"Oh, I believe it."
763,SAAVIK,763,What are
764,you,764,looking at?
765,DAVID,765,I don't know.
766,KIRK,766,Now that's what I call a meal.
767,BONES,767,It's like the Garden of Eden...
768,CAROL,768,"Only here, every apple comes from
the Tree of Knowledge."
769,KIRK,769,"What's on your mind, Lieutenant?"
770,SAAVIK,770,The
771,"Kobayashi Maru
, sir.
DAVID",771,The what?
772,BONES,772,"The no-win scenario -- and with
what philosophy a commander faces
defeat."
773,KIRK,773,"Are you asking me if we are playing
out that scenario now, Lieutenant?"
774,SAAVIK,774,"On the test, sir, will you tell me
what you did? I'd really like to
know."
775,BONES,775,"Lieutenant, you are looking at the
only Starfleet cadet who ever beat
the no-win scenario --"
776,KIRK,776,"And almost got tossed out of the
Academy..."
777,SAAVIK,777,How?
778,KIRK,778,"I reprogrammed the simulation so it
was possible to rescue the ship."
779,"SAAVIK
WHAT
KIRK",779,"I changed the conditions of the
test. I received a commendation for
original thinking."
780,"SAAVIK
WHAT
KIRK",780,I don't like to lose.
781,SAAVIK,781,"Then -- you never faced that
situation -- faced death..."
782,BONES,782,Until now.
783,KIRK,783,"We each face death every day we're
alive, Saavik."
784,KIRK,784,"Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours.
Are you about ready?"
785,SPOCK'S VOICE,785,"Right on schedule, Admiral. Just
give us your coordinates and we'll
beam you aboard."
786,KIRK,786,Right. I don't like to lose.
787,SAAVIK,787,"But the damage report -- we were
immobilized..."
788,KIRK,788,"Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all
people go by the book. Hello,
Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus..."
789,SPOCK,789,Certainly...
790,SAAVIK,790,By the book...
791,KIRK,791,"Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions
are being monitored during battle...'"
792,SAAVIK,792,"'... no uncoded messages on an open
channel...'"
793,SAAVIK,793,You lied.
794,SPOCK,794,I exaggerated.
795,KIRK,795,"Hours instead of days, Saavik; now
we have minutes instead of hours --"
796,BONES,796,I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
797,SPOCK,797,They're inoperative below C-deck.
798,KIRK,798,What IS working around here?
799,SPOCK,799,"Not much, Admiral. We have partial
main power..."
800,KIRK,800,That's it?
801,SPOCK,801,Best we could do in two hours.
802,SULU,802,Admiral on the bridge --
803,KIRK,803,Battle stations.
804,KIRK,804,Tactical.
805,KIRK,805,Uh oh.
806,SPOCK,806,"She can out-run us and out-gun us.
But there is the Mutara Nebula at
153 mark four."
807,KIRK,807,"Scotty, can we make it inside?"
808,SCOTTY,808,"The energizer's bypassed like a
Christmas tree -- so don't give me
too many bumps."
809,KIRK,809,"No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way."
810,SAAVIK,810,"Trouble with the nebula, sir, is all
that static discharge and gas clouds
our tactical display. Visuals won't
function and shields will be useless."
811,SPOCK,811,"What's sauce for the goose, Mr.
Saavik. The odds will be even."
812,DAVID,812,I'm going up there.
813,BONES,813,"You'll be in the way, Dr. Marcus...
best stay here."
814,SAAVIK,814,"Admiral... what happens if Reliant
fails to follow us into the nebula?"
815,SPOCK,815,"I think we can guarantee she'll
follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me
to explain to you the concept of
human ego."
816,KIRK,816,"Best speed, Scotty..."
817,KHAN,817,"There! Full impulse power! Not
so wounded as we were led to believe
-- so much the better..."
818,SPOCK,818,"Estimating nebula penetration
in two minutes. Reliant is
closing."
819,KIRK,819,Steady as you go...
820,JOACHIM,820,We'll lose them if they go in there.
821,KHAN,821,Rake her.
822,BONES,822,Take it easy --
823,CHEKOV,823,But I must --
824,BONES,824,"Listen to me, Pavel; you haven't
the strength or the equilibrium --"
825,CHEKOV,825,But --
826,CAROL,826,"Dr. McCoy, I can't just sit here.
Tell me what I can do."
827,BONES,827,"You can help get my surgery squared
away. I'm expecting customers."
828,SAAVIK,828,That was close --
829,KIRK,829,They just don't want us going in there.
830,SPOCK,830,One minute to nebula perimeter.
831,SPOCK,831,"Admiral, they're reducing speed."
832,KIRK,832,"Uhura, patch me in --"
833,UHURA,833,"Aye, sir."
834,KHAN,834,Why are we slowing?
835,JOACHIM,835,"We daren't follow them into the
nebula, sir -- our shields will be
useless..."
836,KIRK'S VOICE,836,This is Admiral Kirk.
837,KIRK'S VOICE,837,"We tried it once your way, Khan.
Are you game for a rematch?"
838,KIRK'S VOICE,838,Khan -- ! I'm
839,laughing,839,"at the
""superior"" intellect."
840,KHAN,840,Full impulse power!
841,JOACHIM,841,"No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever
you want --"
842,KIRK,842,"I'll say this for him: he's
consistent."
843,SPOCK,843,And we're... in.
844,KHAN,844,Tactical!
845,JOACHIM,845,Inoperative.
846,KHAN,846,Raise the shields...
847,JOACHIM,847,"As I feared, sir. Not functional.
I'm reducing speed."
848,SULU,848,"Phaser lock inoperative, sir."
849,KIRK,849,"Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when
ready."
850,KHAN,850,Aft-torpedoes -- fire -- !
851,KIRK,851,Hold your course. Look sharp...
852,SAAVIK,852,At what.
853,"Reliant
KIRK",853,Evasive starboard!
854,KIRK,854,"Phaser bank one, fire!"
855,KHAN,855,Joachim!
856,JOACHIM,856,Yours... is... the superior...
857,KHAN,857,I shall avenge you --
858,KIRK,858,"Damage, Scotty?"
859,SCOTTY,859,"Admiral, I've got to take the mains
off the line. The energizer's shaken
loose and I can't get in there to
fix her -- radiation --"
860,KIRK,860,"All right, we'll do the job with
auxiliary power."
861,CHEKOV,861,"Could you use another hand, Admiral?"
862,KIRK,862,"Man the weapons console, Mr. Chekov."
863,KIRK,863,Spock?
864,SPOCK,864,"Sporadic energy readings port side,
aft. Could be an impulse turn."
865,KIRK,865,"He won't break off now. If he
followed me this far he'll be back.
But from where...?"
866,SPOCK,866,"He's intelligent, but not experienced.
His pattern indicates two dimensional
thinking..."
867,KIRK,867,"Mr. Saavik, all stop."
868,SAAVIK,868,"All stop, sir."
869,KIRK,869,"Descend ten thousand meters. Stand
by photon torpedoes."
870,KHAN,870,"Where is he? Where in God's name
is he?"
871,CHEKOV,871,"Torpedoes ready, sir."
872,KIRK,872,Fire.
873,KIRK,873,Cease fire. Look sharp.
874,SAAVIK,874,"Power levels quite low, sir."
875,KIRK,875,"Mr. Scott, can you get the mains
back on line?"
876,SCOTTY'S VOICE,876,"I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til
the radiation dissipates."
877,KIRK,877,"Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant:
prepare to be boarded."
878,UHURA,878,"Aye, sir."
879,UHURA'S VOICE,879,"Commander, Reliant, this is
Enterprise. Surrender and prepare
to be boarded. Repeat..."
880,KHAN,880,No... Kirk. The game's not over.
881,KHAN,881,To the last I will grapple with thee!
882,UHURA,882,"Enterprise to Reliant: you are
ordered to surrender your vessel.
Respond!"
883,UHURA,883,"Nothing, sir."
884,KIRK,884,"We'll beam aboard. Alert
transporter room --"
885,SPOCK,885,"Admiral. Scanning an energy source
on Reliant. A pattern I've never
seen."
886,DAVID,886,It's the Genesis Wave!
887,KIRK,887,What?
888,DAVID,888,He's on a build up to detonation!
889,KIRK,889,How soon --
890,DAVID,890,We encoded four minutes --
891,KIRK,891,We'll beam aboard and stop it --
892,DAVID,892,You can't!
893,KIRK,893,"Scotty, I need warp speed in three
minutes or we're all dead!"
894,KIRK,894,Scotty!
895,KIRK,895,"Saavik, get us out, best speed!"
896,SAAVIK,896,"Aye, sir."
897,KHAN,897,"No... You can't get away... From
hell's heart I stab at thee..."
898,KHAN,898,"For hate's sake... I spit my last
breath at thee!"
899,BONES,899,"Are you out of your Vulcan mind?
No human can tolerate the radiation
loose in there!"
900,SPOCK,900,"But, as you are so fond of observing,
Doctor, I'm not human."
901,BONES,901,You're not going in there -- !
902,SPOCK,902,"I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss
this logically --"
903,SCOTTY,903,Spock -- get out of there!
904,KIRK,904,Time from my mark...
905,SAAVIK,905,"Two minutes, ten seconds."
906,KIRK,906,Engine room! What's happening?!
907,SCOTTY,907,"Captain, please!"
908,BONES,908,"Get out! Get out, man! Oh, dear
God...!"
909,KIRK,909,Time!
910,SAAVIK,910,"Three minutes, thirty seconds."
911,KIRK,911,Distance from Reliant...
912,CHEKOV,912,Four hundred kilometers.
913,CADET,913,Sir! The mains are back on line -- !
914,KIRK,914,"Bless you, Scotty. Go, Saavik!"
915,KIRK,915,"Reduce speed. My God, Carl. Look
at it."
916,KIRK,916,Engine Room. Well done. Scotty?
917,BONES' VOICE,917,"Jim, you'd better get down here. Hurry."
918,KIRK,918,"Saavik, take the con."
919,SCOTTY,919,"No, sir! You'll flood the whole
compartment...!"
920,KIRK,920,He'll die -- !
921,BONES,921,"He's dead already, Jim."
922,KIRK,922,"Oh, God."
923,KIRK,923,Spock!
924,SPOCK,924,The ship -- out of danger?
925,KIRK,925,Yes --
926,SPOCK,926,"Don't grieve, Admiral -- it's
logical: the good of the many
outweighs --"
927,KIRK,927,... the good of the few...
928,SPOCK,928,Or the one.
929,SPOCK,929,I never took the
930,Kobayashi Maru,930,"test -- until now. What do you
think of my solution?"
931,KIRK,931,Spock...!
932,SPOCK,932,"I have been -- and always will be
-- your friend... Live. Long. And.
Prosper."
933,KIRK,933,No...!
934,SAAVIK'S VOICE,934,"Admiral, you've got to see this!
There's new life -- a whole new
world, a Genesis world -- !"
935,KIRK,935,"In accordance with the traditions
of Starfleet and of Article 184
Starfleet Regulations, we are
assembled here today to pay final
respects to our honored dead."
936,KIRK,936,"And yet, in the midst of our sorrow
it should be noted that this death
takes place in the shadow of new
life, the sunrise of a new world,
a world that our beloved comrade
gave his own life to protect and
nourish. He did not feel that
sacrifice a vain or empty one --
and we will not debate his profound
wisdom, in these proceedings. Of
my friend, I can only say this, that
of all the souls I have encountered
in my travels, his was the most --"
937,KIRK,937,-- human.
938,KIRK,938,Lieutenant Saavik.
939,SAAVIK,939,"We commend the soul of our brother
departed. We love we commit his
body to the depths of space."
940,SULU,940,Honors -- hup!
941,SULU,941,Return -- hup!
942,KIRK,942,Lieutenant.
943,KIRK,943,"After you dismiss the company, you
will take the watch. Set course
for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up
survivors."
944,SAAVIK,944,"Aye, sir."
945,KIRK,945,"I'll be in my quarters if needed,
but I would prefer..."
946,SAAVIK,946,"Understood, sir."
947,KIRK,947,Dismiss the company.
948,KIRK,948,Yes... come.
949,DAVID,949,I don't mean to intrude.
950,KIRK,950,"Uh, no..."
951,KIRK,951,I should be on the bridge.
952,DAVID,952,Are you running away from me?
953,KIRK,953,I suppose I was.
954,KIRK,954,"I poured a drink. Would you like
it?"
955,DAVID,955,"No. I -- I guess I'm not what you
expected."
956,KIRK,956,I didn't expect anything.
957,DAVID,957,That makes two of us.
958,DAVID,958,"Lieutenant Saavik was right: you
never have faced death --"
959,KIRK,959,"Not like this -- no. I haven't faced
death, I cheated death. I tricked
my way out of death and patted myself
on the back for my ingenuity. I
know nothing."
960,DAVID,960,"You knew enough to tell Saavik that
how we face death is at least as
important as how we face life --"
961,KIRK,961,It was just words.
962,DAVID,962,"But good words. That's where ideas
begin. Maybe you should listen to
them."
963,KIRK,963,"I'm trying, David."
964,DAVID,964,"So am I. My friends were killed,
too."
965,KIRK,965,I am truly sorry.
966,DAVID,966,I was wrong about you. And
967,I'm,967,sorry.
968,KIRK,968,Is that what you came here to say?
969,DAVID,969,Mainly.
970,DAVID,970,"And also that I'm proud -- very
proud -- to be your son."
971,SAAVIK,971,Admiral on the bridge!
972,KIRK,972,"As you were, Mr. Saavik."
973,SAAVIK,973,"Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha.
All is well."
974,KIRK,974,"Good, I believe you already know
my, uh, son --"
975,KIRK,975,"Yes, well, why don't you show him
around and..."
976,SAAVIK,976,"Aye, sir --"
977,SAAVIK,977,So
978,you,978,"turn out to be the dumb
bastard."
979,SAAVIK,979,That is a little joke.
980,BONES,980,She's changed her hair again.
981,BONES,981,"Will you look at that? Think
they'll name it for you, Doctor?"
982,CAROL,982,"Not if I can help it. We'll name
it for our friend."
983,KIRK,983,"It is a far far better thing I do
than I have ever done before... a
far better resting place I go to
than I have ever known..."
984,CAROL,984,Is that a poem?
985,KIRK,985,"Something Spock was trying to
tell me. On my birthday."
986,BONES,986,"You okay, Jim? How do you feel?"
987,KIRK,987,"Young. I feel young, Doctor."
988,KIRK,988,"Lieutenant, new course: 'Second
star to the right and straight on
till morning.'"
989,SPOCK'S VOICE,989,"Space, the final frontier... These
are the continuing voyages of the
Starship Enterprise... Her ongoing
mission: to explore strange new
worlds... to seek out new life and
new civilizations... To boldly go
where no man has gone before..."
