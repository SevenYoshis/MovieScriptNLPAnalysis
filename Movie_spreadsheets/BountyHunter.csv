0,CASS,0,"I'm working, Stewart."
1,STEWART,1,"Come on, take a break. (enticing)
I've got Kahlua..."
2,CASS,2,Cassidy Daley. Talk to me.
3,JIMMY (O.S.),3,It's Jimmy. Tell me you love me.
4,CASS,4,Depends on what you got.
5,JIMMY (O.S.),5,"I've got a confirmed place and
time."
6,CASS,6,"I love you! So, when? Where?"
7,JIMMY (O.S.),7,"You think I'm gonna say this shit
over the phone? I could get killed.
Just meet me at the usual place.
Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost
an extra hundred."
8,STEWART,8,Where ya going?
9,CASS,9,"Hooters. I go there for the hot
wings."
10,STEWART,10,"Please. Nobody goes there for the
hot wings. You got a tip."
11,CASS,11,You got a hundred bucks on you?
12,STEWART,12,Now are you gonna let me in on it?
13,CASS,13,"Sorry. No can do. I have to protect
my source."
14,STEWART,14,"You know what? We need to talk
about our relationship."
15,CASS,15,"We don't have a relationship. We
made out 3 years ago in the copy
room. I was drunk. I was broken-
hearted. I would have made out with
the xerox machine."
16,STEWART,16,"Yes, but you made out with me."
17,CASS,17,I have to go.
18,STEWART,18,I want in on that story!
19,CASS,19,"Hey, Jimmy, I..."
20,CASS,20,Jimmy?
21,CASS,21,"Let go of me, I'm a reporter, I'm
warning you..."
22,VOICE,22,Milo!
23,CRYSTAL,23,What did I say about the fires?
24,MILO,24,"You said ""please set fires in my
bar"". Wait, no, that's not right.
""Please don't set fires in my bar"".
(off her look) Ok, jeez, you try to
get in the holiday spirit..."
25,CRYSTAL,25,Shouldn't you be working?
26,MILO,26,"That's the beauty of my job,
Crystal. Tracking down idiots is
something you can do pretty much
anywhere. See, there's one..."
27,MILO,27,And there's another one...
28,MILO,28,And there's...
29,MILO,29,"I don't believe it. That idiot. (to
Crystal) Save my seat."
30,DWIGHT,30,"There you are, you dipshit."
31,MILO,31,"Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you
fucking ding-dong."
32,DWIGHT,32,We have to stop meeting this way.
33,MILO,33,"Not now, Dwight."
34,DWIGHT,34,You owe my boss money.
35,MILO,35,"Hey, I owe everybody money."
36,MILO,36,I am so happy you did that.
37,BOY,37,That man is killing Rudolph!
38,GELMAN,38,Release the reindeer!
39,GELMAN,39,"Hands behind your head, asshole!"
40,MILO,40,"Take it easy, skippy, I'm just
doing my job."
41,GELMAN,41,"Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don't
you get a real job?"
42,MILO,42,"So I can be like you patrol boys
and sit around all day with my
thumb up my ass?"
43,GELMAN,43,What did you just say?
44,BOBBY,44,Milo Boyd. I shoulda known.
45,GELMAN,45,"Sarg, you know this asshole?"
46,BOBBY,46,"Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used
to be one of us."
47,BOBBY,47,"Look, Milo, I know this is a tough
time of year for you..."
48,MILO,48,"This isn't a tough time of year for
me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't
love Christmas?"
49,BOBBY,49,"...and I try to be sensitive to
your situation..."
50,MILO,50,"What situation? Being a man who
works his own hours and has his
freedom and lives the high life?"
51,BOBBY,51,"...because I realize you're
unhappy."
52,MILO,52,"Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob?
Look at me: I'm the happiest man
alive."
53,BOBBY,53,That sign is pretty hard to see.
54,MILO,54,AAAHHH!
55,RUDOLPH,55,Take me to jail. Please?
56,BOBBY,56,"Ok, I got one for ya: why doesn't
Santa have any children? Cause he
only comes once a year and when he
does, it's down a chimney."
57,BOBBY,57,So. Have you talked to her lately?
58,MILO,58,Talked to who?
59,BOBBY,59,"Katie Couric, motherfucker, who do
you think?"
60,MILO,60,"I haven't talked to her in three
years, why would I talk to her now?"
61,BOBBY,61,"Well, for one thing, so you can
stop taking out your rage on
innocent bystanders."
62,RUDOLPH,62,"Talk to her, man. For real."
63,BOBBY,63,"Do what you want. But this kind of
shit will eat a hole in your
intestines, you don't deal with it."
64,BOBBY,64,"Hey, why don't you come by the
precinct tomorrow for our Xmas
bash?"
65,MILO,65,"I'm not invited. I'm not a cop
anymore, remember?"
66,BOBBY,66,"Fuck that, I'm inviting you."
67,MILO,67,"I don't know, Bob. I'm sorta busy."
68,BOBBY,68,"That's what I'm worried about.
(sighing) Just...take it easy, Ok?"
69,RUDOLPH,69,"You should go to that party, man.
Seriously. You need it."
70,MILO,70,"Do I look like I need advice from a
grown man in antlers?"
71,VOICE,71,Milo. Hey. Princess...
72,SID,72,You're drooling on my sofa.
73,SID,73,"You do have an apartment, don't
you? With a bed of some kind?"
74,SID,74,"Heard you shut down 5th Street
yesterday. Gave every kid in the
county the gift of nightmares."
75,MILO,75,"Hey, I'm a giving kind of guy.
Anyway, what do you care? I brought
your guy in, right?"
76,SID,76,"You gonna give me a hand, or just
stand there killing your liver?"
77,MILO,77,Is that a trick question?
78,SID,78,"So I told her, fine, I'd handle
Xmas this year. I mean, what's to
handle? You buy a tree, some gifts,
cook a ham, hang some lights. An
idiot could do it."
79,MILO,79,"Well, we'll soon find out."
80,SID,80,You have plans for the holiday?
81,MILO,81,The usual.
82,SID,82,"Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and
put your fist through a wall?"
83,MILO,83,Jealous?
84,SID,84,Then forget it.
85,MILO,85,Forget what?
86,SID,86,"I've got an open bond, but your
thing sounds like more fun. I'll
give it to Doug instead."
87,MILO,87,"Whoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the
fuck. I want the job, I'm in the
hole."
88,SID,88,You're always in the hole.
89,MILO,89,What's your point?
90,SID,90,"The truth is, I'm not sure you're
the right person for this job. It
could be a total disaster. On the
other hand, when one friend sees
another friend stagnating in his
own filth, he has to do something,
right?"
91,MILO,91,"Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna
shower."
92,SID,92,Ok. But remember: you asked for it.
93,MILO,93,No.
94,SID,94,Yes.
95,MILO,95,No.
96,SID,96,Yes.
97,MILO,97,No.
98,SID,98,Are we done yet?
99,MILO,99,"Is this a joke? Because if it is,
I'm gonna have to kill you."
100,SID,100,It's not a joke.
101,MILO,101,"She got arrested? And then she
jumped bail?"
102,SID,102,"Apparently the whole thing started
with some reckless driving, and
ended with her assaulting a police
officer."
103,SID,103,She bit him.
104,MILO,104,"Yeah. That sounds like her.
But here's my question: why the
hell did you post her bail?"
105,SID,105,"Hey, I know she dumped you..."
106,MILO,106,"Whoa. She did not ""dump me""."
107,SID,107,"Ok, whatever, I..."
108,MILO,108,"No, not ""whatever"". I dumped her."
109,SID,109,"The point is, I'm aware you guys
have issues, but I'm running a
business here. A person needs bail,
I don't have time to check with you
first."
110,MILO,110,"Well, had you checked with me
first, you wouldn't be out of a
bond right now."
111,SID,111,"I'm not out of a bond if you go
pick her up. It's five grand to
bring her back by 9am, Xmas day."
112,MILO,112,"You're telling me it's five grand
to go pick up my ex-wife and bring
her to jail. (beat) On Xmas."
113,SID,113,You're a good listener.
114,SID,114,I take it you're interested.
115,MILO,115,"I love you! You're the best friend
a guy could ever have!"
116,SID,116,"Ok, take it easy..."
117,TERESA,117,"Sid, you got a DUI on line one.
(off their looks) What's going on?"
118,TERESA,118,Ok. (beat) Can I have my gum back?
119,MILO,119,Right. Sorry.
120,MILO,120,"You know what this is, don't you?
Karma! Payback! You know how they
say ""What goes around comes
around""? Turns out it's true!"
121,MILO (cont'd),121,"(checking the paper) That middle
initial stands for Rhonda, by the
way. She tells people it stands for
""Rachel"", but that's a lie."
122,SID,122,"I can't believe you guys broke up
over a stupid article."
123,MILO,123,"We didn't break up over a stupid
article. We broke up because she is
a cheating, manipulative liar."
124,SID,124,Are you sure you can handle this?
125,MILO,125,"Why wouldn't I be able to handle
this?"
126,SID,126,"Let's face it: you're not exactly
rational around her. I mean, if I
was a cop working a case and some
reporter came snooping around, I'd
say ""no comment"". Not ""no comment,
but care for a cocktail""? And then
a month later, running off to some
love shack called ""Caveman's Cabin""
and tying the knot? Who does that?"
127,MILO,127,"That's not even close to what
happened. For one thing, it was
called ""Cupid's Cabin"". And for
another, that was before I knew how
conniving she was. Now I know. So
all I have to do is track her down,
cuff her up, and bring her in.
(checking his watch) And I've got,
what, two days? Shit, man. Easy as
pie."
128,LORRAINE,128,"You tell him I know where he lives.
I know where his bimbo wife takes
her yoga classes, I know where his
idiot son shoplifts after school,
so he can pay me my money or..."
129,LORRAINE,129,What the hell happened to you?
130,DWIGHT,130,Milo Boyd. Fucker head-butted me.
131,LORRAINE,131,Yeah? Did you get the money?
132,MILO,132,Luck be a lady...
133,MILO,133,Toooo....NIIIIIGHT!
134,MILO,134,I told you this day would come.
135,CASS,135,Jimmy?
136,MILO,136,"You better run, you crazy bitch."
137,SID,137,"Yeah. He took the job. But if this
thing goes bad, I'm blaming you."
138,MILO,138,Nice dog. Very compact.
139,MILO,139,Candygram.
140,MILO,140,Whoops.
141,MILO,141,"`Allo, love."
142,CASS,142,HIIIII-YAAAA!!!
143,CASS,143,Whoops.
144,STEWART,144,"...so, I heard a noise in here and
became concerned..."
145,MILO,145,Wrong. Try again.
146,STEWART,146,"Ok, the truth is she asked me to
pick up her dry-cleaning..."
147,STEWART,147,"Ok, Ok, look, she's working a big
story that was supposed to be mine,
and I want it back."
148,MILO,148,"You sleeping with her, Stu?"
149,STEWART,149,"You mean, like, at this moment?"
150,MILO,150,"Yeah, that's what I mean. Are you
sleeping with her at this very
moment?"
151,STEWART,151,"We have a history, yes."
152,MILO,152,"A ""history"", huh? (snorting) Good
luck with that."
153,CASS,153,"Here, kitty kitty..."
154,CASS,154,Aahh!
155,LANDLADY,155,You're not Jimmy.
156,CASS,156,Oh. No. I'm looking for him.
157,LANDLADY,157,Under the sofa?
158,CASS,158,"Maybe you can help. I'm his
girlfriend."
159,LANDLADY,159,You're LaKeesha?
160,CASS,160,Yes. That's my name. LaKeesha.
161,LANDLADY,161,Maybe I should call the cops.
162,CASS,162,"Wait! Ok, look: Jimmy's in trouble."
163,LANDLADY,163,"What kind of trouble? Money
trouble? Drug trouble? (lower) Sex-
change trouble?"
164,CASS,164,"Something like that. All I know is,
he's missing."
165,LANDLADY,165,"I've had a lousy week, too. My
cousin Linda fell off a cruise
ship."
166,CASS,166,Oh. I'm sorry.
167,LANDLADY,167,"Hey. A grown woman outta know how
to swim."
168,CASS,168,"I hear ya. Anyway. Mind if I take a
quick look around?"
169,LANDLADY,169,"Jimmy's behind on his rent. I bet
his girlfriend would want to take
care of that."
170,CASS,170,I bet she would.
171,MILO,171,"The thing is, Stu, she'll make you
think she's interested in you, when
really all she's interested in is
the case you're working on, because
she wants to launch her big hot-
shot career."
172,STEWART,172,"Wait a second: you're Milo. She
talks about you all the time."
173,MILO,173,Really?
174,STEWART,174,"Oh yeah, dude. She hates you."
175,MILO,175,"Oh, she hates me?"
176,STEWART,176,"Yeah. She says you're the most
selfish, immature, stubborn..."
177,MILO,177,"I'm selfish? I'm immature? You know
what? Forget it. I'm not even gonna
dignify this with...whatever."
178,STEWART,178,"Hey, man, I'm on your team."
179,MILO,179,"No you're not, Geraldo. I don't
allow reporters on my team."
180,MILO,180,"And for the record: I'm the one who
hates her. Just so that's clear."
181,MILO,181,That figures. Run home to mommy.
182,MILO,182,"Well, nice meeting ya, Stu."
183,STEWART,183,"Wait, where are you going?"
184,MILO,184,"I'm going to pick up your
girlfriend. But don't worry, if she
ever gets out of jail, I'm sure
you'll be very happy together."
185,LANDLADY,185,Time's up. Find anything?
186,CASS,186,Nope. Not a thing.
187,LANDLADY,187,"Oh, well. Don't worry, hon. He
probably just went away for the
holidays."
188,JIMMY,188,"Ok, ok, I told one person about the
Xmas Eve job, but she doesn't even
have all the details, I swear!"
189,MAHLER,189,Gimme a name.
190,MILO,190,"...and this loser she's dating
looks like he buys his clothes from
Kmart."
191,SID,191,Why do you care?
192,MILO,192,I don't. I just think it's funny.
193,SID,193,"Hilarious. Listen to me: you guys
made a terrible couple."
194,MILO,194,"I know that. You don't have to tell
me that."
195,SID,195,"Relationships aren't about
competition, they're about
compromise."
196,MILO,196,"You mean like when your wife wants
to do one thing, and you want to do
another, and you compromise by
doing what she wants?"
197,SID,197,"Exactly. Now just get her here.
Cause I can't afford to lose this
bond."
198,MILO,198,"No worries. In fact, I already know
where she is and I'm gonna go pick
her up right now."
199,VOICE,199,"Milo Boyd. Ex-cop, current bounty
hunter..."
200,RAY,200,"...lives in Jersey City, drives a
68 Caddy. Been in the hole on and
off with us the past 3 years. We
checked his place, his hangouts, no
luck."
201,LORRAINE,201,"This is no good. We let this guy
slide, suddenly everybody thinks,
hey, it's the holidays! All debts
are cancelled! Get the word out, I
want this guy brought here so he
can pay what he owes us, Dwight can
break something of his, and we can
all enjoy our Xmas."
202,STEWART,202,"That's my space, you asshole!"
203,MILO,203,"Happy to see you, too."
204,LOIS,204,"How dare you...after what you did
to my baby..."
205,MILO,205,Ok. What say we do this inside?
206,MILO,206,What happened to the pirate show?
207,LOIS,207,"I got sick of it. Now I'm a female
impersonator."
208,MILO,208,But...you are female.
209,LOIS,209,"That's why I'm so good at it. Help
me with this."
210,MILO,210,"Where is she, Lois? I need to talk
to her."
211,LOIS,211,"Oh, Milo, where did it all go
wrong? Do you have any idea what it
means to waste a woman's child-
bearing years? It's criminal. Every
month her eggs are jumping out of
her ovaries like sailors abandoning
a sinking ship. I mean, I know you
were mad about that article..."
212,MILO,212,"I wasn't mad about that article. In
fact: what article?"
213,LOIS,213,"Listen to me, Milo: Cassidy may be
a strong independent woman on the
outside, but on the inside she's
just a girl who wants to be
protected and loved by her man.
What happened between the two of
you devastated her."
214,MILO,214,Devastated her right to the top.
215,LOIS,215,"She has done well, hasn't she?"
216,LOIS (cont'd),216,"I must admit, it makes me proud to
think that my little girl, whose
only friend growing up was an
imaginary orphan with a tin leg
named Leslie, now gets invited to
tour the White House..."
217,MILO,217,She got to tour the White House?
218,MILO,218,"Tell me where she is, Lois."
219,LOIS,219,"Oh, who knows. She was running
around like a chicken with its head
cut off, said she was on the
biggest story of her career. Said
she was going somewhere to think."
220,STEWART,220,Dammit.
221,CASS,221,"No one with that name? What about a
casino? Nothing? Thanks."
222,CASS,222,Jimmy?
223,STEWART,223,"No, who's Jimmy?"
224,CASS,224,"Look, Stewart, I'm busy."
225,STEWART,225,"Ok. (casually) Where are you, by
the way? I mean, exactly."
226,CASS,226,"I'm in Miami, if you must know. I'm
on the beach building a sand castle
and drinking from a coconut..."
227,MILO,227,"Hello, Cass."
228,CASS,228,"Hello, Milo."
229,MILO,229,Fancy meeting you here.
230,CASS,230,Yeah. Fancy that.
231,MILO,231,How are you?
232,CASS,232,Fine. You?
233,MILO,233,Swell. Nice day.
234,CASS,234,Bright.
235,MILO,235,Brisk.
236,CASS,236,Crisp.
237,MILO,237,Invigorating.
238,CASS,238,What are you doing here?
239,MILO,239,"""Building a sand castle, drinking
from a coconut"". Man, once a liar,
always a liar."
240,CASS,240,"You know what? I don't have time
for this, I'm working."
241,MILO,241,"Working? Hey, me too."
242,CASS,242,Congratulations. Move your leg.
243,MILO,243,"What I do is, I track down
criminals. People who jumped bail.
Idiots who decided to go on the run
after biting police officers. I
find them, and I take them to jail."
244,CASS,244,"Now, hold on just a second, Milo..."
245,MILO,245,"Tell you what: I'll give you more
than a second. I'll give you 10.
For old times sake."
246,MILO,246,10...9...8...
247,MILO,247,Strike one.
248,MILO,248,Strike two.
249,MILO,249,Strike three. Get in.
250,CASS,250,"I'm not going to jail, Milo."
251,MILO,251,I beg to differ.
252,CASS,252,"Oh please. Like you're gonna shoot
me."
253,MILO,253,"Nope. (loudly) I'm gonna shoot a
cab driver."
254,CASS,254,Chicken shits.
255,CASS,255,"Ok, look: let's talk about this."
256,MILO,256,Ok.
257,CASS,257,"Listen, Milo, I'm not sure we
should..."
258,CASS,258,"Hey, wait a minute!"
259,CASS (O.S.),259,Bastard.
260,CASS (O.S.),260,Great. Perfect timing.
261,CASS,261,Cassidy Daley.
262,JIMMY,262,It's me. Jimmy.
263,CASS,263,"Shit, Jimmy, I thought you were
dead."
264,JIMMY,264,"Don't be silly. (hurrying on)
Listen: you didn't happen to go to
my place and find that envelope I
left, did you?"
265,CASS,265,"I did, but I don't really get it,
what's ""Sparrow""?"
266,JIMMY,266,"It doesn't matter. Did you tell
anyone else about this story?"
267,CASS,267,"Are you kidding? You think I want
to share a story like this?"
268,JIMMY,268,"Ok. Good. Cause the truth is, there
is no story. I made the whole thing
up. So you should just drop it..."
269,CASS,269,"Uh-uh, no way are you backing out
on me now, Jimmy. This story is way
too good..."
270,JIMMY,270,Where are you?
271,CASS,271,"I'm at the Atlantic City Boardwalk.
Actually, I'm in the trunk of my ex-
husband's car. Long story. More
importantly, where are you?"
272,JIMMY,272,I'm...
273,CASS,273,Jimmy? Hello?
274,MILO (O.S.),274,"Deck the halls with boughs of
holly, fa la la la laaaa..."
275,TERESA,275,Sid's Bail Bonds.
276,MILO,276,Guess who's in my trunk?
277,TERESA,277,"Is that some sort of perverted
innuendo? Who is this?"
278,MILO,278,"Aw, come on, Teresa, you know it's
me. Put Sid on."
279,TERESA,279,"Sid's busy shopping. (snorts) He
thinks he can handle Xmas."
280,MILO,280,"Ok, just tell him I got her and
I'll be back in 2 hours. I want a
bonus for bringing her in so quick."
281,TERESA,281,"Yeah? I want a bonus for getting
through the holidays without
stabbing anyone with a fork."
282,MILO,282,"Don't be such a pessimist. You
still have time."
283,MILO,283,Gotta go. I got another call.
284,MILO,284,"Tina's Thai massage! Where every
ending is a happy one!"
285,CASS,285,"You're disgusting. Let me out of
the trunk."
286,MILO,286,"Hmm. Nope. By the way, your
boyfriend Stewart's been following
me. Unfortunately, I had to ditch
him at the track."
287,CASS,287,"Why is Stewart..? (realizing) And
wait: who said he's my boyfriend?"
288,MILO,288,"Aw, don't be embarrassed. These
things happen. You were drunk when
you guys hooked up, right?"
289,CASS,289,"You know what, Milo? I shouldn't
have run from you like that. I
was...I don't know. You caught me
off-guard. The truth is, I'm kind
of in some trouble and I could
really use your help."
290,MILO,290,"Bad news for you, then. I wouldn't
help you if you were the very last
baby sea turtle in the world,
dragging its tiny weak body across
the burning hot sand while sea
gulls circled overhead. I'd just
pull up a chair, sip a pina colada,
and let nature take its course."
291,MILO,291,"Hey, I used to be a sucker, but no
more. You can cry til the cows come
home, for all I care."
292,MILO,292,"Holy shit! (calling out) Hey, um,
Cass? (no response) Cassidy?"
293,MILO,293,"It's Ok, hang on, I'm coming..."
294,CASS,294,"You know something, Milo? You're
one of the most gullible..."
295,MILO,295,AAAAHHH...
296,CASS,296,Ow ow ow...
297,MILO,297,Son of a...
298,CASS,298,AAGH...
299,MILO,299,OW...
300,CASS,300,"NOOOO! Uncle, uncle, uncle!"
301,CASS,301,Dirty fighter.
302,MILO,302,Me? I'm the dirty fighter?
303,CASS,303,"Should we...I don't know...hug, or
something?"
304,MILO,304,Sure. What the hell.
305,CASS,305,"Hey. I had to try, right?"
306,MILO,306,Get in the car.
307,CASS,307,Your windshield's cracked.
308,MILO,308,"Thanks, Captain Obvious."
309,CASS,309,"And you look like shit, Milo. What
have you been doing, sleeping on
the floor?"
310,MILO,310,"I enjoy sleeping on the floor.
Matter of fact, I love sleeping on
the floor. I love everything about
my life. Great job, good friends,
hot girlfriend..."
311,CASS,311,You have a girlfriend?
312,MILO,312,Yes I do.
313,CASS,313,Really? What's her name?
314,MILO,314,"Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to
cook pasta for me and perform strip-
teases."
315,CASS,315,Wow. Is she missing a chromosome?
316,MILO,316,"Oh, she has all her chromosomes,
believe you me."
317,CASS,317,"Well, my life is great, too."
318,MILO,318,"I can tell. You and Stewart make a
great couple, by the way. You and
me made a terrible couple. But you
two? Like peas in a pod."
319,CASS,319,You know what I like about Stewart?
320,MILO,320,I can't imagine.
321,CASS,321,He's not you.
322,MILO,322,Not even on his best day.
323,CASS,323,Or his worst.
324,MILO,324,I'll bet he has a lot of those.
325,CASS,325,"Still betting, huh?"
326,MILO,326,You can't win if you don't play.
327,CASS,327,"Or, in your case, even if you do."
328,MILO,328,I win all the time.
329,CASS,329,Really? I hadn't noticed.
330,MILO,330,"You know what? Seeing as how I'm
about to come into five grand..."
331,MILO,331,"I think I'll do a little betting
right now."
332,CASS,332,Don't you have to take me back?
333,MILO,333,"Please. I have two days. A monkey
could get you back in two days."
334,CASS,334,Aren't you afraid I'll get away?
335,MILO,335,Nope.
336,STEWART,336,"Damn, I'm good!"
337,CLERK,337,"Merry Xmas, Mr Boyd!"
338,CLERK,338,"What a nice surprise! Let's hope
your luck is better today."
339,MILO,339,"Sure, if there's such a thing as
better than great, which is how my
luck has been lately. Great."
340,CLERK,340,Oh. Yes sir. Of course. My mistake.
341,LORRAINE,341,"The idiot just showed up at
Bally's."
342,DWIGHT,342,I'm on it.
343,LORRAINE,343,Uh-uh. Not you. (calling out) RAY.
344,LORRAINE,344,Go get this asshole.
345,MILO,345,Prepare to observe the master.
346,CASS,346,"Ok, how about this:"
347,CASS,347,"If I give you all the cash in my
wallet, will you let me go?"
348,MILO,348,Hmm. Lemme see...
349,MILO,349,Nope. Guess not.
350,MILO,350,Hit me.
351,CASS,351,I'd really like to.
352,DEALER,352,Dealer wins.
353,CASS,353,"Nice going, master."
354,WAITRESS,354,And for the couple over here?
355,MILO,355,We're not a couple.
356,CASS,356,"Why would you think we were a
couple?"
357,MILO,357,"We used to be together. Back when I
was young and foolish."
358,CASS,358,And I was confused.
359,MILO,359,And I was slumming.
360,CASS,360,And I was drunk.
361,WAITRESS,361,"Great story. I have to get back to
work now."
362,MILO,362,Wait. Champagne! I'm celebrating.
363,MILO,363,Son of a bitch.
364,CASS,364,"Look, Milo, the truth is...my Mom
is in the hospital."
365,MILO,365,Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par?
366,CASS,366,"She might be really sick. That's
why I had to jump bail."
367,MILO,367,"Taking care of her, huh? Putting
aside your career for a loved one?
Golly, that's so you."
368,CASS,368,You've already been to see her.
369,MILO,369,"Impressive. No wonder you got all
those awards. So lemme guess: the
real reason you jumped bail is
cause you're on a story."
370,CASS,370,Stewart. Stewart told you.
371,MILO,371,"I would have figured it out on my
own, trust me."
372,CASS,372,"I wouldn't trust you if you were
the last man alive."
373,MILO,373,"You think about that much? Me being
the last man alive? Am I naked in
this fantasy?"
374,CASS,374,"Ok, you're right. I'm on a story.
A very important story. It just so
happens that I'm possibly about to
uncover a whole ring of dirty cops."
375,CASS,375,What?
376,MILO,376,"Please. Isn't the whole ""dirty cop""
thing kind of old? Maybe you should
do a story about something people
are interested in. Like internet
porn. Or lesbians."
377,CASS,377,"I'm serious, Milo. This is gonna be
big. And here's what I'm willing to
do (magnanimous): I'm willing to
credit you in the article."
378,MILO,378,"Oh, sure, like you credited me in
the 13th Street Article?"
379,CASS,379,"Why on earth would I have credited
you? I worked my ass off for that
story."
380,MILO,380,That's one way of putting it.
381,CASS,381,What's that supposed to mean?
382,MILO,382,"Forget it. I don't want to be in
your article. In fact, I would
rather eat a bowl of broken glass
than have my name in any way
associated with one of your lousy
articles..."
383,CASS,383,Fine. Forget I mentioned it.
384,MILO,384,I already have.
385,CASS,385,"I mean, you're not a cop anymore,
right? What do you care if people
were murdered?"
386,MILO,386,Please. Nobody was murdered.
387,CASS,387,Just my source.
388,MILO,388,"Oh yeah? How? Bullet to the back of
the head?"
389,CASS,389,Well...
390,MILO,390,Dumped in a reservoir?
391,CASS,391,I don't know.
392,MILO,392,Car accident?
393,CASS,393,"Ok, ok, maybe he wasn't murdered
yet. But I wouldn't be surprised
if..."
394,CASS,394,"Maybe this whole thing sounds like
no big deal to you..."
395,MILO,395,"You know what it sounds like? It
sounds like you're going to jail."
396,CASS,396,"Milo, listen, you have to believe
me, come on, you know me..."
397,MILO,397,"Exactly! I do know you. Which means
I know you are a deceptive, cold-
hearted bitch who is going to jail
where she belongs."
398,WAITRESS,398,"Champagne. So. What are we
celebrating?"
399,CASS,399,I have to use the bathroom.
400,WAITRESS,400,"Alrightee, then. Cheers."
401,CASS,401,"Can I have some privacy, please?"
402,MILO,402,I'm gonna have to frisk you.
403,CASS,403,"Get it over with, then."
404,MILO,404,You gain a little weight?
405,CASS,405,You lose a little hair?
406,CASS,406,"Yeah. Right. I'm hiding a weapon in
my breasts."
407,MILO,407,Make it quick.
408,STEWART,408,"Shit, man, you startled me. (beat)
Can I help you?"
409,RAY,409,Night-night.
410,MILO,410,You almost done in there?
411,CASS,411,"""Put open end in direct contact
with skin. Press button..."""
412,MILO (O.S.),412,"Hello? Ok, that's long enough, I'm
coming in..."
413,CASS,413,Sorry...
414,VOICE,414,Need a lift?
415,CASS,415,"He says we made a terrible couple.
Which is true. I know that. I'm the
one who thought that first. I'm the
one who came up with that. The fact
is, I don't want to be with someone
who can't admit he was wrong."
416,DRIVER,416,So you're available.
417,CASS,417,Available for what?
418,DRIVER,418,I have a waterbed in my trailer.
419,CASS,419,"I hope you don't think you're
telling me something that interests
me."
420,DRIVER,420,You know what I want for Xmas?
421,MILO,421,You better run.
422,CASS,422,"Hey, it's locked!"
423,MILO,423,I know.
424,CASS,424,"Open the door, you son of a bitch!"
425,CASS,425,Uh-oh...
426,LORRAINE,426,Ray's got something to show you.
427,RAY,427,Merry Xmas.
428,LORRAINE,428,Pick something and break it.
429,STEWART,429,"Whoa, wait just a minute..."
430,LORRAINE,430,Feel better?
431,DWIGHT,431,"You know, I do feel better. (beat)
Who is this guy, anyway?"
432,LORRAINE,432,Milo Boyd.
433,DWIGHT,433,That's not Milo Boyd.
434,RAY,434,He was in Milo Boyd's Cadillac.
435,LORRAINE,435,"Both of you go this time, and make
sure you get the right guy. I don't
have time for this shit."
436,STEWART,436,What about me?
437,CASS,437,"Clever. (noting all the weapons)
Wow. You were gonna use all that
stuff on me?"
438,MILO,438,"A guy can dream, can't he?"
439,CASS,439,"Ok, look, Milo, let's just clear
the air, Ok? So maybe it was a
mistake, thinking we could be
involved while working on the same
case..."
440,MILO,440,"Hey, I know it was a mistake. Don't
think you're telling me something I
don't know, cause you're not."
441,CASS,441,"Ok. Fine. But can we just put aside
our differences for two seconds?
Because back at the casino, I think
I saw someone following me."
442,MILO,442,Sure that wasn't me?
443,CASS,443,"I don't think so. This guy was
lacking your trademark smell of
booze and KFC."
444,MILO,444,Ha ha.
445,CASS,445,"Anywho. If these dirty cops have my
source hostage somewhere..."
446,CASS,446,What's so funny?
447,MILO,447,"You think dirty cops are trying to
kill you? Look, I know you think
you're hot shit and everything, but
I'm pretty sure the only one around
here who might want to kill you is
me."
448,CASS,448,Oh no.
449,MILO,449,What?
450,CASS,450,"Behind us. It's him. The guy I saw
back at the casino."
451,MILO,451,"Yeah? He doesn't look like a cop to
me."
452,CASS,452,Speed up!
453,MILO,453,"Would you just calm down for a
second and..."
454,CASS,454,NO!!
455,MILO,455,Jesus christ...
456,MILO,456,"LISTEN, YOU MANIAC..."
457,CASS,457,MILO...
458,MILO,458,...LET GO...
459,CASS,459,MILO...
460,MILO,460,...NO ONE IS TRYING TO KILL YOU...
461,CASS,461,MILO!!!
462,MILO,462,SHIT!!!
463,CASS,463,"I told you they were trying to kill
me!"
464,MILO,464,"Yeah, well, no one's killing you
until I get you to jail."
465,CASS,465,"You're still taking me to jail? But
it's the cops who are after me."
466,MILO,466,"First of all: that guy was not a
cop. Second of all, we just left
him unconscious in a ditch. You'll
be fine."
467,CASS,467,"But...this is important! This is my
job!"
468,MILO,468,"And this...(pointing between them)
is my job."
469,CASS,469,"Milo, you don't understand what's
going on!"
470,MILO,470,"I'll lay it out for you: some loser
with a minor sheet calls you up and
says, hey, I've got a big story for
you, you interested? It'll only
cost you a couple hundred bucks,
and I'll tip you onto some criminal
activity, it's your chance to
expose some bad guys and write the
story of your life. Then the moron
gets himself caught, he's probably
in cold storage somewhere, and now
you think the bad guys are after
you. (beat) See? I get it. I just
don't care."
471,CASS,471,"If only I knew exactly when and
where this deal was going down.
Course, if I can't figure out that
part, then you definitely can't
figure out that part, because we
both know I'm much smarter than
you."
472,MILO,472,"Please. My brain can dance circles
around your brain."
473,CASS,473,I don't even know what that means.
474,MILO,474,Case closed.
475,CASS,475,Fine. Guess we'll never know.
476,MILO,476,"""Atlantic City. Xmas Eve. Sparrow.""
What's ""Sparrow""?"
477,CASS,477,I knew you couldn't figure it out.
478,MILO,478,It's a business.
479,CASS,479,No.
480,MILO,480,Casino.
481,CASS,481,Nope.
482,MILO,482,Stripper?
483,CASS,483,"I don't think so. What kind of
strip bars have you been going to,
anyway?"
484,CASS,484,"Oh, well, forget it, I knew you
couldn't do it."
485,MILO,485,"Please. I could crack that story
and still get you to jail on time."
486,CASS,486,Oh yeah?
487,CASS,487,Wanna bet?
488,MILO,488,You're on.
489,MILO,489,I have to make a call.
490,CASS,490,Hey. Aren't you going to uncuff me?
491,MILO,491,Why? You going somewhere?
492,CASS,492,Um...no.
493,MILO,493,Then you don't need to be uncuffed.
494,CASS,494,Asshole.
495,MILO,495,"So there's just gonna be a little
delay..."
496,SID,496,"I don't get it. Why are you helping
her?"
497,MILO,497,"But that's the beauty of it, Sid,
I'm not helping her, she only
thinks I'm helping her."
498,SID,498,"Yeah? If you're not helping her,
what are you doing?"
499,CASS,499,What is he up to?
500,MILO,500,"I'll tell you what I'm doing: I'm
gonna crack this case first, and
I'm gonna take all the credit. Who
knows, maybe I'll even get my job
back...."
501,SID,501,"You are so full of shit. You don't
want your job back. You just want
to prove you're smarter than she
is."
502,MILO,502,"I am smarter than she is. I would
have cracked that 13th Street case
way before she did if she hadn't..."
503,SID,503,"...cheated, right, I know, you've
told me a million times. Did it
ever occur to you that a normal
couple wouldn't compete the way you
guys do in the first place?"
504,MILO,504,"This from the man currently trying
to prove to his wife he can handle
Xmas."
505,SID,505,I can handle Xmas!
506,MILO,506,"Just..trust me, Ok?"
507,SID,507,Do I have a choice?
508,MILO,508,Nope.
509,MILO (O.S.),509,So. Atlantic City. Xmas Eve...
510,MILO,510,"...so what exactly are these dirty
cops supposed to be doing?"
511,CASS,511,"Stealing evidence from property
rooms. Then destroying it, for the
right price."
512,CASS,512,What?
513,MILO,513,"Nothing. It's just...it's a good
idea. If it weren't, you know.
Wrong. (continuing) So. Your plan
is to catch them red-handed before
they can destroy the evidence, then
write an expose for the paper and
win yourself another big award."
514,CASS,514,Something like that.
515,MILO,515,"Only, you don't know what Sparrow
is. (thinking) Could be a nickname.
Or the place where the evidence is
stashed. Or a code word of some
kind. But the guy who knows has
gone missing, and you think the
dirty cops got a hold of him."
516,CASS,516,"When Jimmy called earlier, someone
else was there. And they
disconnected the call."
517,MILO,517,"So we find your source, we find the
dirty cops. Gimme your phone."
518,CASS,518,What?
519,BOBBY (O.S.),519,Milo! Merry Xmas!
520,BOBBY,520,"Here's one: why did the snowman
pull down his pants? Cause he heard
the snowblower was coming!"
521,MILO,521,"Funny. Listen, Bob, I need a favor."
522,BOBBY,522,Anything.
523,MILO,523,"I need an address to go with a
phone number. But I need it ASAP.
Kinda got a guy on my tail..."
524,TOW TRUCK DRIVER,524,"The garage is closed for the night.
Guess you'll have to wait til
tomorrow."
525,MAHLER,525,Guess not.
526,CASS,526,"Pretty proud of yourself, ey?"
527,MILO,527,"Hey. You're a reporter. Great. But
I used to be a cop. Let's face it:
I'm naturally gonna be one step
ahead of you."
528,CASS,528,You weren't last time.
529,MILO,529,What did you say?
530,CASS,530,I said you're doing a great job.
531,CASS,531,"Ok, here's what I think we should
do: I'll go up first, Jimmy knows
me, so if anything's wrong I'm sure
he'll give me a sign..."
532,MILO,532,"Excellent plan. Oh, except you're
staying in the car."
533,CASS,533,But...it's my story!
534,CASS,534,Asshole.
535,MILO,535,You Ok? My bad.
536,DRUNK GUY,536,"Watch where you're going. (under
his breath) Prick."
537,MILO,537,"Merry Xmas to you, too!"
538,MILO,538,Room service.
539,MILO,539,What the...?
540,MILO,540,What the hell are you doing?
541,CASS,541,"It's my story, I don't break
stories by staying in the car!"
542,MILO,542,"Yeah, well, (re: the armrest)
you're paying for that."
543,CASS,543,"Oh, ok. Here's a nickle."
544,MILO,544,Perfect. (to Cass) Play along.
545,MILO,545,Godammit. Son of a bitch.
546,MILO,546,"This is like the third card they've
given me..."
547,CASS,547,"Take it easy, honey..."
548,MILO,548,"Don't tell me to take it easy, now
we have to go all the way
downstairs again..."
549,MAID,549,What's the name?
550,MILO,550,Davenport. Room 2505.
551,MILO,551,You're an angel.
552,CASS,552,Wait a second: where's my gun?
553,MILO,553,I don't know. Where is your gun?
554,CASS,554,I don't have one.
555,MILO,555,"Then you've answered your own
question."
556,CASS,556,"Come on, give me something. You've
got, like, a million weapons in the
jacket."
557,MILO,557,"Hey. These are not toys. You can't
just give them to someone and have
them know how to use them."
558,CASS,558,"I seem to remember doing just fine
with your taser gun."
559,CASS,559,"Oh, god, is that blood?"
560,MILO,560,Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door.
561,CASS,561,I'm just trying to...
562,MILO,562,"This could be a crime scene. There
are clues all over this room that
only a trained eye can find. And as
I seem to recall, you were the one
who was unable to figure this out
by herself."
563,CASS,563,He is unbelievable.
564,MILO,564,"Who are you talking to, your
imaginary friend Leslie?"
565,CASS,565,"Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary
friends, despite what my mother
believes."
566,MILO,566,"Whatever. You wait by the door. And
I'll handle this."
567,CASS,567,Fine.
568,CASS,568,"So you're saying you don't want my
help."
569,MILO,569,I'm saying I don't need your help.
570,CASS,570,Ok.
571,MILO,571,What was that?
572,CASS,572,What was what?
573,MILO,573,Did you find something?
574,CASS,574,"How could I find anything? I'm not
the detective."
575,MILO,575,Lemme see your purse...
576,VOICE,576,FREEZE!
577,GUARD,577,Hotel security! Stay where you are!
578,MILO,578,"Ok, Ok, no problem. You're probably
gonna want this."
579,GUARD,579,"DROP THE WEAPON, NOW!"
580,MILO,580,"Take it easy. I'm just gonna unload
it."
581,MILO,581,You're gonna have to jump.
582,CASS,582,I can't.
583,BOBBY (O.S.),583,"Ok, so some guy you're looking for
has disappeared. You want me to put
out an all-points on him?"
584,MILO,584,"The thing is, Bob: Cass thinks
dirty cops might be involved."
585,BOBBY,585,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're with
Cassidy? Shit, Milo, you know when
you're around her your brain turns
to mush."
586,MILO,586,"Yeah, well, that doesn't change the
fact that someone took a couple
shots at us."
587,BOBBY,587,You get a plate number?
588,MILO,588,"Happened too quick. But it was a
dark 4-door Chevy, blue or grey,
New Jersey plates, and the car was
wrecked, I know that."
589,BOBBY,589,"Ok. Lemme look into it. See what I
can find. Just hold tight, Ok?"
590,MILO,590,"Ok. But we're kinda on a clock
here."
591,BOBBY,591,"Milo, don't fuck around with this.
If there are dirty cops in the
house, we all have a problem. So do
me a favor: get off the strip, find
somewhere to lie low and wait for
my call."
592,DWIGHT,592,"Yeah, that's him."
593,RAY,593,Who's the chick?
594,DWIGHT,594,"Who gives a fuck? Anyway, they
can't be far."
595,CASS (O.S.),595,Ok. Kill me now.
596,MILO,596,"I'm sorry, it's the only place I
know off the strip."
597,CASS,597,"I'm not going in. What if they
remember us?"
598,MILO,598,"They won't remember us. Why would
they remember us? Just...try to act
normal."
599,DAWN,599,"Can I help you? (realizing) Wait,
it can't be..."
600,DAWN,600,"Edmund, come quick!"
601,EDMUND,601,Be still my beating heart.
602,MILO,602,Looks like they remember us.
603,CASS,603,Ya think?
604,EDMUND,604,"What a lovely surprise. It's been,
what, 3 years?"
605,MILO,605,Has it?
606,CASS,606,I don't really remember...
607,DAWN,607,"And you came back! To celebrate
your anniversary!"
608,CASS,608,"Oh, no. No, no..."
609,EDMUND,609,What an honor for us!
610,CASS,610,"Actually, we're not..."
611,DAWN,611,"You know what? In light of this
special special occasion: it's on
the house!"
612,MILO,612,Honey? Can I talk to you?
613,MILO,613,You have any money?
614,CASS,614,"No, as you recall, I gave you all
my money at the blackjack table...
(realizing) You blew all the money!"
615,MILO,615,"Hey! I would have won it back if
someone hadn't tasered me in the
bathroom!"
616,CASS,616,So. Use a credit card.
617,MILO,617,Mine's max'd. Lemme have yours.
618,CASS,618,"Mine's max'd too. (off his look)
What, I like to shop."
619,MILO/CASS,619,It's our third anniversary!
620,DAWN/EDMUND,620,Congratulations!
621,MILO/CASS,621,Thanks!
622,EDMUND,622,To begin: a little aphrodisiac!
623,MILO,623,Wow.
624,CASS,624,Great.
625,EDMUND,625,"So tell me: how have you managed to
keep the romance alive all this
time?"
626,MILO,626,"Well, I'll tell you, Edmund.
The secret to our success is that
the little woman here knows her
place. She cleans for me, cooks for
me, and every night when I come
home she gets down on her knees and
massages my feet."
627,CASS,627,"Yes, Edmund, it's true. I massage
his feet to help him feel like a
man. It's important, especially
when your husband has such a teeny
tiny..."
628,DAWN,628,"How is everything? Is it like that
magical night 3 years ago?"
629,CASS,629,Uh-huh.
630,MILO,630,Yup. You betcha.
631,DAWN,631,This calls for a toast!
632,DAWN,632,"May I have your attention please?
Edmund and I would like to share
with you the most romantic moment
we have ever seen. It was three
years ago today, in this very
restaurant, when this lovely young
man here, right in the middle of
the meal, threw down his napkin,
got down on one knee, and said
marry me, right now, right this
second, I want to go to sleep
tonight knowing you're my wife!"
633,EDMUND,633,"And she said yes, with tears in her
eyes and a tremble in her hand,
let's get married, and they ran out
to the all night chapel and came
back an hour later, man and wife!"
634,MILO,634,Can I get a whiskey?
635,CASS,635,Make that two.
636,MILO,636,"After we broke up, I was so mad at
you, I told everyone I know you
have herpes."
637,CASS,637,"I told everyone you flunked out of
3rd grade."
638,MILO,638,"I told everyone you have a
moustache."
639,CASS,639,"I told everyone you like to wear my
panties."
640,MILO,640,Hey!
641,CASS,641,"Wow. This would be really awkward
if we still had feelings for each
other. Which we don't..."
642,MILO,642,"That's right. Luckily, we're
different people now. We don't feel
the way we used to."
643,CASS,643,Right. We've moved on.
644,MILO,644,"We have no feelings about each
other whatsoever."
645,MILO,645,"Just two people who used to know
each other."
646,CASS,646,Two casual acquaintances.
647,MILO,647,"Feels good, doesn't it?"
648,CASS,648,Feels fantastic.
649,MILO,649,"A platonic relationship. Working
together."
650,CASS,650,Helping each other.
651,MILO,651,Trusting each other.
652,CASS,652,Well. Mind if I shower?
653,MILO,653,Ladies first.
654,CASS,654,Hey. It's me.
655,MOM (O.S.),655,Sheryl?
656,CASS,656,"No, not Sheryl. Cass. (beat) Your
daughter."
657,MOM,657,"Jesus Christ, where the hell are
ya, Niagara Falls?"
658,CASS,658,"No. You're not gonna believe this,
but: I'm at Cupid's Cabin with
Milo."
659,MOM,659,Oh my god...
660,CASS,660,Mom...
661,MOM,661,I always knew you two would...
662,CASS,662,Mom. We're not back together.
663,MOM,663,Why the hell not?
664,MOM,664,"I mean, I just don't get it, you're
in this romantic place, you have a
perfect opportunity to win him
back..."
665,CASS,665,"Why should I have to win him back?
He should have to win me back! And
who says I want him back, anyway?"
666,MOM,666,"I have never understood this
competitive streak of yours..."
667,CASS,667,"Look, the reason I called: I
remember you worked at this one
place where they had these bright
green matches with, like, this
silhouette of a horse on them?"
668,MOM,668,"That was a long time ago! And all I
did was serve drinks..."
669,CASS,669,"I just need to know the name of the
place."
670,MOM,670,"Charley's. And Ok, I admit, maybe I
did a little dancing, but how often
do you make 200 an hour in tips?"
671,CASS,671,I gotta go.
672,MOM,672,I want grandkids!
673,MILO,673,Sneaky bitch.
674,CASS,674,Sneaky bastard.
675,MILO,675,Good shower?
676,CASS,676,The best.
677,MILO,677,Great.
678,CASS,678,"You know what's great? Trusting
each other."
679,MILO,679,I agree.
680,MILO,680,Time for bed!
681,MILO,681,Excuse me.
682,MILO,682,What are you doing?
683,CASS,683,Um...
684,MILO,684,Are you trying to seduce me?
685,CASS,685,Yes. Yes I am.
686,MILO,686,"I didn't know you were still so
attracted to me. I mean, I remember
how you used to like to greet me at
the door in nothing but a..."
687,CASS,687,"Yes, it's true, I'm still attracted
to you."
688,MILO,688,"Really? Wow. That's great news. You
know what would be really sexy
right now?"
689,CASS,689,If we both just went to sleep?
690,MILO,690,No. If you talked dirty to me.
691,CASS,691,"Ok. (in a sexy voice) Sewage. Mold.
Rotting carcass..."
692,MILO,692,"No, I mean, tell me about your
attraction to me."
693,CASS,693,"Um...I can't stop thinking about
you."
694,MILO,694,Really? What part of me?
695,CASS,695,Just...all of you.
696,MILO,696,Be specific.
697,MILO,697,"My great hair? My chest?
Or...something lower like..."
698,MILO,698,My gun?
699,MILO,699,I knew I couldn't trust you!
700,CASS,700,I knew I couldn't trust you!
701,MILO,701,"When were you gonna tell me about
the matches you found back there in
the hotel room?"
702,CASS,702,"When were you gonna tell me you
have no intention of helping me
with my story?"
703,MILO,703,"You're right. I'm not helping you.
This is my story now. This time I
get to come out on top! Karma,
babe. K-a-r-m-a. Karma...."
704,CASS,704,"Oh my god, would you get over it
already! So I cracked the case
before you did, it was 3 years ago,
it happened, stop being such a baby
and move on!"
705,MILO,705,"Oh I'm moving on. You know how I'm
moving on? By cracking this case
before you, then taking you in so
you can spend this Xmas in jail,
all alone."
706,JIMMY,706,"So this is your place, huh? Nice.
Cozy. Probably more fun to sit
where you can actually see the
dancers, but..."
707,JIMMY,707,"Oh. Hey, listen, no need for that,
I swear I'll be as quiet as a
mouse."
708,MAHLER,708,I know you will.
709,MILO,709,I'm just curious.
710,TERESA,710,"No, I do not keep my ex's photo in
my wallet."
711,SID,711,What's the problem now?
712,MILO,712,No problem...
713,TERESA,713,"She keeps their wedding photo in
her wallet. He wants to know what
that means."
714,SID,714,"It means she's madly in love with
you."
715,MILO,715,Really?
716,SID,716,"No, you idiot, it means she hasn't
cleaned out her wallet in 3 years.
I'm pretty sure I'm still carrying
around a condom from 1987. (to one
of the kids) Son of a bitch,
Jeremy, don't eat things you find
on the floor."
717,TERESA,717,I think it means she loves him.
718,MILO,718,"Really? Cause it did make me
wonder..."
719,SID,719,"Why do you care? Listen to me: you
hate this girl, remember? You drank
yourself out of a job over this
girl."
720,MILO,720,I quit my job.
721,SID,721,You were fired.
722,MILO,722,I quit by getting myself fired.
723,TERESA,723,Are you sleeping with her?
724,SID,724,"Teresa, get off the line. I knew I
should have sent Doug. Milo, do me
a favor. Don't call me again until
you get her to jail."
725,MILO,725,Shit.
726,MILO,726,What was that about?
727,CASS,727,"Nothing. I had her add mayo to your
burger. I remember you like that."
728,MILO,728,Oh. (surprised) Thanks.
729,MILO,729,"Ok, look: I know you're probably
upset that you're not gonna get the
story. But a person can't win every
time, right?"
730,CASS,730,Depends on the person.
731,MILO,731,Whadya mean?
732,CASS,732,"Well, if the person you're
referring to is you, I agree: you
can't win every time."
733,CASS,733,What's wrong?
734,MILO,734,This burger...
735,CASS,735,"One day stuff like that is gonna
kill ya. (pause) Who knows? Maybe
even today."
736,MILO,736,"My tug...is thwelling...(gasping)
I tink dere might be sesame..."
737,CASS,737,"Yeah, I had her add that with the
mayo. Is that bad? Oh wait, you're
violently allergic to sesame.
Whoops. My bad."
738,CASS,738,"You know what that is? ""Karma"". Oh,
and, I'll get the story. Watch me."
739,CASS,739,"911? Yeah, there's a guy here about
to go into anaphylactic shock.
Better hurry."
740,CASS,740,"Yeah, ""Charley's"". (listening) On
the boardwalk? Great. Thanks."
741,EMT,741,Relax. That was an adrenaline shot.
742,MILO,742,"I don't believe it. She tried to
kill me."
743,EMT,743,"No one tried to kill you, buddy.
You just need to be more careful
about what you eat."
744,MILO,744,Thanks. Great tip.
745,MILO,745,Know where this place is?
746,EMT,746,"Sure. Charley's, on the boardwalk.
And just FYI: when they say ""don't
touch"" the dancers, they mean with
with any part of your body, not
just your hands."
747,MILO,747,"Thanks for the ride, by the way."
748,CASS,748,Jimmy?
749,JIMMY,749,"Untie me, quick, that psychopath is
gonna be back here any second..."
750,CASS,750,"So what the hell is ""Sparrow""?"
751,DWIGHT (O.S.),751,I have a better question...
752,DWIGHT,752,Where the fuck is Milo?
753,JIMMY,753,"You know what? I think I'll get a
real job. Work at Kinko's. Or
Burger King. That doesn't sound so
bad anymore..."
754,RAY,754,Hey. Who the fuck are you?
755,JIMMY,755,Nobody.
756,RAY,756,"Right. So what the fuck are you
doing in this car?"
757,DWIGHT,757,"Run, you jackass."
758,MILO,758,"What do you want, you crazy bitch?"
759,CASS,759,"What kind of asshole runs up a
gambling debt with a bunch of
Neanderthals..."
760,RAY,760,That's not what I told you to say.
761,RAY,761,"As you can see: we have your
girlfriend."
762,CASS,762,And I'm not his girlfriend.
763,MILO,763,"Oh, she's my girlfriend alright.
But fair is fair: you guys can keep
her."
764,RAY,764,I think he hung up.
765,CASS,765,He what?
766,DWIGHT,766,Gimme that.
767,MILO,767,"Hello, Lucky's Libations!"
768,DWIGHT,768,"Look, Milo, I don't think you
understand: we're gonna hurt her."
769,MILO,769,"Oh, I understand, alright, and I
don't blame ya. I want to hurt her
all the time."
770,CASS,770,"Milo, listen, they're not kidding,
Ok?"
771,MILO,771,Ok. Fine. Say you were wrong.
772,CASS,772,For what?
773,MILO,773,"For what? For poisoning me with
sesame and almost killing me!"
774,CASS,774,Ok. Maybe that was not the best...
775,MILO,775,Say you were wrong.
776,CASS,776,I could have found a more mature...
777,MILO,777,Say you were wrong.
778,CASS,778,I was possibly out of line...
779,MILO,779,Say you were wrong.
780,CASS,780,"Ok, ok, I was wrong!"
781,MILO,781,"Ok. Now. Admit that the only reason
you were able to crack that case
three years ago was because you
looked through my files."
782,CASS,782,What?
783,MILO,783,I think I'll hang up now...
784,CASS,784,"Ok, Ok. I looked through your
files. Are you happy?"
785,MILO,785,"Thrilled. Now tell them I'll be
there in 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
stop shifting in your seat like
that and just tell them you have to
use the bathroom."
786,MILO,786,Don't look around. Just do it.
787,CASS,787,"You boys mind if I use the ladies
room?"
788,MILO,788,"You know what my mistake was? I
never should have let you out of
the trunk. I'm fine, by the way.
The doctor said I may have been
technically dead for a few seconds,
but I'm fine now."
789,CASS,789,"So that's what you really think?
That I stole information from you?"
790,MILO,790,"It's not what I think, it's what I
know. How else did you beat me?"
791,CASS,791,"Did it ever occur to you that I
just might be good at my job?"
792,CASS,792,"That's what I thought. You know
what, Milo? You're an even bigger
asshole than I previously
suspected, and you deserve
everything that's happened to you.
(beat) And everything that's about
to happen to you."
793,MILO,793,You wouldn't...
794,CASS,794,MILO BOYD IS IN HERE!
795,DWIGHT,795,"Wow. You always carry this much
gear?"
796,MILO,796,Only during the holidays.
797,MAHLER,797,Remember me?
798,DWIGHT,798,What the fuck?
799,DANCER,799,Lapdance?
800,DANCER,800,Maybe I should come back later...
801,CASS,801,"Get off the car, Milo."
802,CASS,802,"Get off the car, you psychopath."
803,MILO,803,"Oh, I am a psychopath, and you know
why? Cause you made me that way.
And if I'm going crazy, I'm taking
you with me."
804,CASS,804,AAHHH!!
805,MILO,805,AAHHH!!
806,MILO,806,LET GO...
807,CASS,807,"NO, YOU LET GO..."
808,BYSTANDER,808,"It was an old Cadillac, this crazy
girl driving, and the guy was like,
on the roof..."
809,MILO,809,Yeah?
810,BOBBY,810,"What the fuck are you doing? I
thought I told you to lie low."
811,MILO,811,I was lying low...
812,BOBBY,812,"Yeah? Then how is it that a
statewide all-points was just put
out on the two of you?"
813,MILO,813,It's a long story.
814,BOBBY,814,"Ok, look, you guys better come to
me, I'll protect you til we figure
this out. Can you get to Pier 19?"
815,MILO,815,Yeah.
816,BOBBY,816,Get in.
817,CASS,817,"So, these guys have a bunch of
stolen evidence stashed somewhere
in Atlantic City..."
818,MILO,818,"And we think they're ditching it
tonight."
819,BOBBY,819,"You know, if I was them, I'd store
the evidence on a boat, drive the
boat about 30 miles out, and blow
the whole thing up."
820,BOBBY,820,"Hey, man. I got mouths to feed."
821,MILO,821,"Aw. That's what all the dirty cops
say."
822,BOBBY,822,"You've always been such a stubborn
asshole, Milo. You just don't
listen. All you had to do was stay
where I told you and none of this
would have happen. Now the two of
you are gonna have to go down with
the boat."
823,BOBBY,823,"Ok. Guess that's it. Gotta go.
(checking them out) You know what?
You guys make a great couple."
824,MILO,824,What's so funny?
825,CASS,825,"My mom was worried I wouldn't have
plans for Xmas Eve."
826,MILO,826,"Hey, are you crying?"
827,CASS,827,No. I'm not...
828,MILO,828,"Ok, just don't..."
829,CASS,829,I'm not crying.
830,MILO,830,I know you're not.
831,CASS,831,"I just...(miserable) I can't
believe I going to die by being
blown up and sinking to the bottom
of the ocean with someone who
thinks I'm a total liar."
832,MILO,832,We're not gonna die.
833,CASS,833,Oh yeah? What's the plan?
834,MILO,834,Well...
835,MILO,835,"Ok. Here's what we do. We're going
to synchronize our efforts in order
to cross the room and manipulate
the bomb out of the room and into
the water in order to diffuse the
explosive impact."
836,CASS,836,"You mean we're going to throw the
bomb out the window?"
837,MILO,837,"Uh, yeah. Or we can just wait to
get blown up."
838,CASS,838,"I'm with you. Go, team, go."
839,MILO,839,"That's the spirit. Ok, first we're
going sideways: to the left..."
840,MILO,840,Ok. My left this time...
841,MILO,841,"Now we're gonna work our way over
to the bomb."
842,MILO,842,"And I don't think you're a total
liar, but in my own defense, I was
one of the top detectives in my
division, I had been working that
case for months, and then you just
waltzed in and solved it."
843,CASS,843,"I didn't just ""waltz in"". You know
I had been working it for months,
too. Isn't it possible that we're
both good at our jobs, and I just
happened to come out ahead?"
844,MILO,844,"Oh. Well, I...(blurting out) Look,
I was confused, I had never been in
love before!"
845,CASS,845,"Well, neither had I!"
846,CASS,846,Ow...
847,MILO,847,Shit..
848,CASS,848,Dammit...
849,CASS,849,Milo?
850,MILO,850,"I'm Ok. Ok, we need to turn to the
right, and wait for the next wave."
851,MILO,851,My right.
852,MILO,852,So. You were in love with me?
853,CASS,853,"Of course I was in love with you,
why do you think I married you?"
854,CASS,854,"Oh. My. God. You think I married
you so I could get info on the
case? Who am I, Mata Hari?"
855,CASS,855,"She's a spy, Milo."
856,MILO,856,"I know that. Everybody knows that.
Mata Hari the spy."
857,MILO,857,"Well. It might be a little late for
this. But...nice job on the
article."
858,CASS,858,"You know, if I had something sharp
right now, I would stab you."
859,MILO,859,"No, really, I mean, it was well-
written and..."
860,CASS,860,"Can you just get us out of here,
please?"
861,CASS,861,Umph...
862,MILO,862,Ughh...
863,CASS,863,Son of a...
864,MILO,864,Ow...
865,CASS,865,Can you see the bomb?
866,MILO,866,"Uh, yeah. I can see the bomb. Now
we get up."
867,CASS,867,Did you throw it?
868,MILO,868,Not exactly.
869,CASS,869,"Well, what are you waiting for?"
870,MILO,870,"I'm waiting for a pig to fly in
here and grab it."
871,CASS,871,Milo...
872,MILO,872,"Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to
jump."
873,CASS,873,What?
874,MILO,874,"You know: ""jump, jump, jump around,
jump."""
875,CASS,875,Are you serious?
876,MILO,876,"No. I'm fucking with you. For fun.
Just for my own personal
enjoyment..."
877,CASS,877,"Ok, Ok."
878,MILO,878,"Ok: 1, 2, 3..."
879,CASS,879,Think the water defused it?
880,MILO,880,"Lemme ask you this? Has anything
gone our way yet?"
881,CASS,881,Nice job.
882,MILO,882,"Hey. You, too."
883,CASS,883,Thanks.
884,MILO,884,"Now lets find something to cut
these ropes off..."
885,CASS,885,Think we can catch that cop?
886,MILO,886,"Trust me: we can definitely catch
that cop."
887,MILO,887,"Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya..."
888,MILO,888,"What's the difference between a
snowman and a snowwoman? (holding
something up) The spark plug."
889,MILO,889,Merry Xmas. I got you this.
890,CASS,890,You shouldn't have.
891,MILO,891,"Hey. I've still got three hours to
get you to jail. Looks like I'm
gonna win that bet after all."
892,MILO,892,You have got to be kidding me.
893,CASS,893,I'm not going without a fight.
894,MILO,894,Yeah. I'm getting that.
895,MILO,895,"9am. See? Easy as pie.(nudging
Cass) Go on, say it."
896,CASS,896,"I'd like to turn myself in. (can't
resist) Though I didn't do anything
wrong..."
897,MILO,897,Stop talking.
898,CASS,898,...and I was unjustly arrested...
899,MILO,899,See ya.
900,CASS,900,Oh. Ok.
901,GELMAN,901,"Hey. It's that jerk-off bounty
hunter."
902,MILO,902,"Ah, what the hell."
903,CASS,903,"Oh my god, what happened?"
904,MILO,904,"Hey. I couldn't let you spend Xmas
alone. Besides, I didn't really
have any plans other than drinking
some cheap whiskey and putting my
fist through a wall."
905,CASS,905,"I'm touched that you would give
that up for me."
906,MILO,906,Hey. It's the kind of guy I am.
907,SID (O.S.),907,"Well, you were right."
908,LOIS,908,"Of course I was right. I knew
they'd get back together if they
were just stuck together long
enough. And thank god. Better she
drives him crazy than me."
909,SID,909,I hear ya.
910,CASS,910,I love you.
911,MILO,911,I love you more.
912,CASS,912,"Well, I doubt you love me more."
913,MILO,913,I'm just saying I love you a lot.
914,CASS,914,"Right. I know. I love you a lot,
too. Let's just say you love me and
leave it at that."
915,MILO,915,Fine. I love you.
916,CASS,916,Fine. (beat) Cause I love you more.
917,MILO,917,"Oh yeah? (glancing at her) Wanna
bet?"
