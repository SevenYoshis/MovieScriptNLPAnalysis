11,CLERK,11,That's nice.
12,CERRITO,12,"Yeah. And gimme those three

14,CLERK,14,A little early for Halloween?
15,CERRITO,15,"Yeah. Halloween's coming early
this year. What do I owe you?"
16,JUSTINE,16,... taking me out to breakfast?
17,HANNA,17,Can't. Bosko's waiting..
18,LAUREN,18,"Hi Vincent. Mom, where's my
barrettes?"
19,HANNA,19,"Hi, sweetie."
20,JUSTINE,20,I saw them on the kitchen
21,JUSTINE,21,Want me to make coffee?
22,HANNA,22,No school today?
23,LAUREN (O.S.),23,"Daddy's picking me up! We're
going to see the new site and
then shopping and lunch."
24,LAUREN (O.S.),24,They're not on the table.
25,JUSTINE,25,Then I don't know...
26,JUSTINE,26,He's already half an hour late.
27,HANNA,27,"He gonna show? Or the son of a
bitch gonna stand her up like
last time?"
28,JUSTINE,28,Want the coffee?
29,HANNA,29,I'm out of time...
30,JUSTINE,30,"Falls back on the pillow,
disappointed. It's as if she'd
been stood-up. The bed sheet
falls half off of her. She's
exposed, vulnerable. She looks
out the window, occluded by light
muslin, away from us and exhales."
31,CERRITO,31,You Waingro?
32,WAINGRO,32,Yeah.
33,WAINGRO,33,You're Cerrito huh?
34,WAINGRO,34,What kinda guy is this Neil?
35,CERRITO,35,Okay.
36,WAINGRO,36,You guys always work together?
37,CERRITO,37,All the time.
38,WAINGRO,38,"Real tight crew, huh?"
39,CERRITO,39,That's right.
40,WAINGRO,40,"This works good, maybe I could
go again?"
41,CERRITO,41,"Yeah.   Stop talking, slick..."
42,NEIL (V.O.),42,You ready if I need you?
43,TOWNER,43,Yeah.
44,NEIL (V.O.),44,Got their air?
45,TOWNER,45,Yeah.
46,RADIO ANNOUNCER,46,"...Daddio's jazz patio on KDCA.
Brought to you this fine day,
which is A-okay, by Twister.
Hey, mister, go out and buy a
bottle of that
Twister...Wiiiiiine..."
47,NEIL,47,Turn it off.
48,CERRITO,48,Time.
49,CHRIS,49,Their response time?
50,NEIL,50,"Two minutes, fifty seconds."
51,NEIL (V.O.),51,"We ought to be down the chute
into the escape route in 2:20."
52,NEIL (V.O.),52,Here we go...
53,GUARD #1,53,211! We're being taken down!
54,DISPATCHER (V.O.),54,"Car 74, what's your ETA to the
211 in progress Hoover and 14th?
Over."
55,CAR 74 (V.O.),55,Car 74. Three minutes. Over.
56,DISPATCHER (V.O.),56,"Car 74. Take it. Car 37, you're
back-up. Car..."
57,TOWNER,57,There's the call. Three minutes.
58,WATCH:,58,"28, 29, 30, 31, 32..."
59,NEIL,59,"Next one blows you up!    Out!
Now..."
60,NEIL,60,Now!
61,NEIL,61,Up against the wall!
62,NEIL,62,8o seconds left.    Move it.
63,WAINGRO,63,Flatten - up against it!    Higher!
64,GUARD TWO,64,...you didn't have that gun..
65,WAINGRO,65,What?!
66,CERRITO,66,"That's true, slick, cause you're
a real tough guy. But he has
the gun. And me, too. So shut
the fuck up."
67,NEIL,67,Move out!
68,NEIL,68,38 seconds left!
69,WAINGRO (O.S.),69,"...hadda mouth off? In front of
them?"
70,NEIL,70,Ten. Nine.
71,NEIL,71,Blew the margin. Here we come.
72,TOWNER,72,One on your tail.
73,NEIL,73,Here we come.
74,NATE,74,"A million, six at 40 cents onna
dollar's 640. Here's a hundred
forty thou front money. Get you
the rest, 2-3 days."
75,NATE,75,What happened out there?
76,NEIL,76,I don't want to talk about it.
77,NATE,77,Wait a minute.
78,NEIL,78,What's the matter?
79,NATE,79,You know who these belong to?
80,NEIL,80,"""Malibu Securities ..."
81,NATE,81,You know John Van Zant?
82,NEIL,82,No.
83,NATE,83,"Malibu Securities is a brokerage
he controls. Planned
bankruptcies, made out during
the S&L's, money laundering..."
84,NATE,84,"You ripped off his Treasury
Certificates."
85,NEIL,85,So what?
86,NATE,86,"That's the point. On top of
collecting his insurance, maybe
he wants to buy back his bonds.
From him I can get you 60 cents
on the dollar instead of 40.
Means an extra 320 to you."
87,NEIL,87,Try it on.
88,NATE,88,You know Cezar Kelso?
89,NEIL,89,By reputation.
90,NATE,90,"He's got this score he's putting
out and wants you to look at."
91,NEIL,91,"What do I need look at his score
for? I got my own."
92,NATE,92,"He said you'll get near eight
figures. Very clean."
93,NEIL,93,9:00a.M. tomorrow.
94,NATE,94,Take it easy.
95,HANNA (O.S.),95,Where's the ambulance?
96,HEINZ (O.S.),96,"They dumped it four blocks from
here..."
97,HEINZ,97,"Masks, guns, radios - all left
behind. No prints."
98,HANNA,98,"What about the crash, the white
towtruck."
99,HEINZ,99,"Hasn't turned up. Got a witness:
janitor next door."
100,HANNA,100,"I.D. anybody? Plate?
Description?"
101,HEINZ,101,Shhaaapes ...
102,HEINZ,102,"One big. One thin.    He heard
it..."
103,HANNA,103,What about them?
104,DRUCKER,104,"According to the janitor, he..."
105,DRUCKER,105,"Started mouthing off to one of
the gunmen."
106,HANNA,106,"Oh, that was smart."
107,DRUCKER,107,I figure the other went for...
108,DRUCKER,108,"... that gun when the shooting
started. One guy called a guard
""slick."""
109,HANNA,109,"""Slick?"""
110,DRUCKER,110,"Yeah.   And they ignored the loose
cash."
111,HANNA,111,"'Cause they had no time, cause
they knew our response time,
cause they were on our air."
112,HEINZ,112,You recognize their m.o.?
113,HANNA,113,"Yeah. Their m.o. is that they
are good. Once it escalated
into a Murder One beef for all
of them after they killed the
first two, they popped guard
number three 'cause it didn't
rake any difference anymore, so
why leave a living witness?
Drop of a hat? They'll rock and
roll. Also: the way they went
into the side indicates they are
equipped to go in on the prowl.
So also start looking for recent
highline burgularies that have
'mystified' us."
114,HANNA,114,"Run the ""slick"" bit to the FBI
and see what it kicks out."
115,DRUCKER,115,I called it in already.
116,HANNA,116,"Split the fences. I'll take
Cuzomano and Torena. You take
the East side. Go through the
tapes of who we been listening
to."
117,HANNA,117,"Hang in with Forensics on all
physical evidence."
118,HANNA,118,"How'd they know the route of the
van and what it was carrying?
Does Gage print the day's routes?
What do they do with the
printouts? Who collects their
trash? Run makes on all their
middlemanagement. Did someone
give this score up?"
119,HANNA,119,"Check the three guards. See if
one of them was a tipster."
120,BOSKO,120,"What's the vibe: home-grown or
out-of-town?"
121,HANNA,121,"Out-of-town. Frankly, I hope
they are scoring once and passing
through. And I doubt it."
122,HEINZ,122,This going to stay in Area?
123,HANNA,123,"This look like boosters working
the local Seven Eleven to you?
It goes to Major Crime."
124,HANNA,124,Go to work.
125,WAINGRO,125,Anybody want some pie?
126,NEIL,126,"This is a partial   split, but I
took out of ours   - every - to
make up..."
127,NEIL,127,"...his full end.    Because I want
to settle him up   and get rid of
this jagoff right   now."
128,CERRITO,128,Okay.
129,NEIL,129,Fuck off.
130,WAINGRO,130,I had to dust him!
131,NEIL,131,"Electricity and chemicals a little
fucked up?"
132,NEIL,132,You a shooter? Speed? What?
133,NEIL,133,"You didn't have to. Now we got
extra heat off a clean score."
134,CERRITO,134,Hold it.
135,CHARLENE,135,Where's the rest?
136,CHRIS,136,That's it.
137,CHARLENE,137,"Eight thousand dollars?   You
gotta be kidding me!"
138,CHRIS,138,"I squared the bookies and we had
to pay off some guy and were
short to start 'cause the rest
is comin', in a coupla days. So
don't sweat it."
139,CHRIS,139,We're late.
140,CHARLENE,140,"Listen to me. ""As The World
Turns"" can get interrupted with
a news flash of you splattered
all over the street ..."
141,CHARLENE,141,"I can get sent up on an accessory
beef. Your son, Dominick, winds
up in a home. For $8,000?"
142,CHARLENE,142,"Honey, for $8,000, it ain't worth
the risk. Risk versus reward?
Baby?"
143,CHRIS,143,"Don't worry about money. Neil's
got..."
144,CHRIS,144,"Hey, if we're goin', let's go."
145,CHARLENE,145,"Where's the club you were going
to open?"
146,CHRIS,146,"Here comes the ""showgirl with a
future"" bit."
147,CHARLEJ,147,Shut up! I left for a good thing.
148,CHARLEJ,148,"Why am I even talking to you? I
can't talk to you. All you are
is a child growin' older..."
149,CHRIS,149,The hell's that mean?
150,CHARLENE,150,"It means we're not making forward
progress like real adults and
you won't listen."
151,CHRIS,151,"I told you: me and Neil got
planned ..."
152,CHARLENE,152,"""Me and Neil."" I'm married to
you, now. This isn't the fucking
joint."
153,CHRIS,153,Don't mouth off to me!
154,CHARLENE,154,I want out of here!
155,CHRIS,155,Well there's the fucking door!
156,CHRIS,156,"Only leave Dominick, the bank
book and the car keys on the
kitchen table!"
157,CHARLENE,157,"You can keep that other crap!
But Dominick goes with me."
158,CHRIS,158,"I'll find ya and kill you, you
bitch, wherever you are - you
ever try to take Dominick away
from me."
159,ANITA (O.S.),159,"Daddy, daddy!"
160,ELAINE,160,Hungry?
161,CERRITO,161,Starving.
162,ELAINE,162,You okay?
163,CERRITO,163,Put this away.
164,ANITA,164,"Daddy, what's in the box?"
165,CERRITO,165,What do you care?
166,CERRITO,166,Open it up.
167,EADY (0. C.),167,Help you with something?
168,NEIL,168,No thanks.
169,NEIL,169,You closing in a few minutes?
170,EADY,170,Yeah.
171,EADY,171,Excuse me.
172,EADY,172,You interested in metals?
173,NEIL,173,No.
174,NEIL,174,"It's the color reproduction of
these plates..."
175,EADY,175,"We have a first edition of
Kandinsky's Theory of Color with
hand pulled lithographic prints
bound in. Would you like see
it?"
176,NEIL,176,Sure.
177,EADY,177,I see you in here before.
178,NEIL,178,"You're open late.       Not many open
this late."
179,NEIL,179,What's your name?
180,EADY,180,Eady.   Eady Tse.      What's yours?
181,NEIL,181,Bukowski. Neil Bukowski.
182,CASALS (V.O.),182,M. C. U.
183,HANNA,183,"Bobby, it's me."
184,CASALS (V.O.),184,"Boss, whoever's fencing the Bearer
Bonds is either highline or out-
of-town. Everyone's talking
about it. No one knows about
it."
185,CASALS (V.O.),185,"Schwartz went through the indexes
on recent surveillance tapes?
No armored cars. No witnesses
on who stole the ambulance."
186,HANNA,186,Albert Torena call me back?
187,CASALS (V.O.),187,No.
188,HANNA,188,Hi.
189,JUSTINE,189,Where have you been?
190,HANNA,190,"Work. Harvey show or'd Lauren
get stood up again?"
191,JUSTINE,191,He didn't even call her.
192,HANNA,192,What an asshole. She okay?
193,JUSTINE,193,"She's been in her room all day
and won't talk. So ""no,"" she's
not okay. And neither am I."
194,JUSTINE,194,"If I try to create something
like a mood between us you back
away. I made a great dinner for
us. That was four hours ago."
195,JUSTINE,195,At least get yourself a plate...
196,HANNA,196,"There's three dead bodies in an
alley off Adams."
197,HANNA,197,"I'm really sorry the lamb got
overcooked."
198,HANNA,198,"Looking after her is tired.
Very tired. He doesn't know why
he said what he did. He regrets
it. So he turns on his TV to
watch the news and his eyes glaze
over."
199,EADY,199,What do you do?
200,NEIL,200,"Swimming pools. Institutional.
Schools, State, counties. I'm
on the sales end."
201,NEIL (CONT'D),201,Let me have another coffee.
202,NEIL (CONT'D),202,You like selling books?
203,EADY,203,"Yeah. Especially fine art books.
I study them."
204,NEIL,204,Yeah?   Like what?
205,NEIL,205,Tell me.
206,EADY,206,"There's a Skira edition of
Delacroix charcoal sketches, I
like..."
207,NEIL,207,What else?
208,EADY,208,Asian art work.
209,EADY (V.O.),209,"The plates are mezzotints. They
evoke a feeling Japanese painters
called ""sabi"". They believed
there were eight scenes of
transcendental loneliness. They
painted them over and over again.
One is a flock of geese hovering
over a field. There's always
mist. It's painted just as the
leader touches down."
210,NEIL,210,City of lights.
211,EADY,211,Yeah.
212,NEIL,212,"I flew over the arctic once at
40,000 feet. The moonlight was
blue on all the snow. It felt
like that."
213,EADY,213,Do you travel a lot?
214,NEIL,214,Yeah.
215,EADY,215,Are you lonely?
216,NEIL,216,I'm alone.    Not lonely.
217,NEIL,217,You?
218,EADY,218,I get lonely.
219,HANNA,219,"You were supposed to get back to
me last night. So where the
fuck were you, Albert?"
220,ALBERT,220,"I couldn't break free, man!"
221,HANNA,221,"I oughta violate your ass right
now."
222,ALBERT,222,"I was all night hitting up Los
vatos like one of those flamenco
matador guys. Cuttin' in real
smooth. Generating leads and
shit. I'm a dancer, man!"
223,HANNA,223,"You're a bust-out speed freak
jackin' metamphetamine again."
224,HANNA,224,I'm in a hurry.
225,ALBERT,225,"You talk to my brother, Raoul.
He meet you tonight at..."
226,HANNA,226,No.   Right now.
227,ALBERT,227,"I implore him, man. But he say
""no."""
228,ALBERT,228,"He in Phoenix. Tonight's the
best I can do for you. The Zebra
on Crenshaw. Eleven o'clock."
229,HANNA,229,"You be there, too."
230,ALBERT,230,"Mon, I go"
231,HANNA,231,Be there!
232,CEZAR,232,"I picked you out to pitch it to
first, but don't think you're
the only action in town and I'm
giving it away. 'Cause I'm not."
233,NEIL,233,What is it?
234,CEZAR,234,"A bank. On Thursdays it gets
cash deposits for distribution
to other branches. The branches
have to buttress their cash
accounts to handle Friday payroll
checks from a Toyota and Nissan
plant, a steel mill and two
refineries. One day a week,
Thursday, the main branch carries
the full whack."
235,NEIL,235,"You want a $100,000 advance,
against a full 101. Why?"
236,CEZAR,236,"'Cause I can get it. 'Cause
this is the best thing I seen in
three years. 'Cause a screw-up
makes 10 percent of nothin' equal
nothin'. And 'cause those are
the terms and they ain't
negotiable."
237,NEIL,237,On the prowl or strong?
238,CEZAR,238,"Strong. Through the front door.
During the day."
239,NEIL,239,How many guys?
240,CEZAR,240,Four.   Three plus a driver.
241,NEIL,241,"That's not a $100,000 worth
anything. You're giving me an
address to what's strictly a
cowboy score: ""Get the guns and
let's go!"" We smash, grab and
boogie while they hit the alarm."
242,CEZAR,242,"Three alarms. And that's why
the price. 'Cause you chop-in
through the roof the night before
on the prowl and bypass 'em. I
got circuit diagrams, blue prints,
the works. So yeah, they hit
the alarms, but nothing gonna
happen."
243,NEIL,243,Do I have to kill people?
244,CEZAR,244,"I doubt it. Two men have the
two keys to open the box."
245,NEIL,245,"Full architectural, plumbing and
electric, camera placements?"
246,CEZAR,246,All of it.
247,NEIL,247,What do you estimate?
248,CEZAR,248,"Eight point, one. Eight point,
two million dollars."
249,CEZAR,249,Where's Nate?
250,NEIL,250,He hadda make a call.
251,NEIL,251,You're on.
252,NEIL,252,"Here's five grand earnest money.
You get the rest after lunch."
253,NATE,253,"Look, Van Zant. Nobody knew the
merch was yours or they would
have respected it. Be that as
it may: now you get 100% from
the insurance company and you're
even, plus you can get the bonds
back for 60 cents onna dollar.
You make an additional 40%.
Your operation doesn't skip a
beat, and everybody's making
out."
254,VAN ZANT,254,Sure. You got a deal.
255,NATE (0.   S.),255,"Good. Cause there's    no percentage
in everybody getting   their
underwear in a twist   over this."
256,VAN ZANT,256,"Absolutely. You have your man
call me to set the meet."
257,NATE (O.S.),257,Usually I'm the mailman.
258,VAN ZANT,258,"I don't want to involve extra
people. What the fuck do I want
all kinds of people meeting each
other for?"
259,NATE (O.S.),259,Okay.
260,VAN ZANT,260,Nice talking to you...
261,VAN ZANT,261,"Van Zant hangs up. He's a tall
avuncular man with a flabby belly
and Arrow shirts: an accountant.
HUGH BENNY, a very large juice
collector, is in the office."
262,HUGH,262,You gonna deal with these people?
263,VAN ZANT,263,"So word hits the streets it's
okay to steal my stuff? I'm
gonna kill the sonsa-bitches."
264,NEIL,264,I bought it.
265,NATE,265,What I tell you?
266,NEIL,266,The bonds?
267,NATE,267,"We're on. You call him
tomorrow..."
268,NATE,268,... and set a meet.
269,NEIL,269,How is he?
270,NATE,270,Very cool.   He's a businessman.
271,LILLIAN,271,Here it is.
272,LILLIAN,272,You okay?
273,BREEDAN,273,"Don 't worry, baby.   Gonna do
good."
274,BREEDAN,274,I'm Breedan. You Solenko?
275,SOLENKO,275,"Yeah. Fucking hillbilly grill
ran didn't show. Been here since
4:30. You know this kinda
operation?"
276,BREEDAN,276,The grill. Yeah.
277,SOLENKO,277,"Grill? Empty the garbage, mopout
the toilets. You gimme a hard
time, I'll find something to
violate you back and blow your
parole."
278,SOLENKO,278,"You kick back 25% of your salary
to me under the table. Grierson
your parole officer? Right?"
279,BREEDAN,279,Yeah.
280,SOLENKO,280,"Check it out. Change in the
back. Hurry up."
281,HANNA (0 .S.),281,Cuzomano. Open up.
282,HANNA,282,"Whaddaya hear, whaddaya say?."
283,CUZOMANO,283,"Hiya, Vincent. About what?"
284,HANNA,284,"About this crew that knocked
down three guards yesterday and
took a Gates Armored truck.
Bearer Bonds. Start making calls."
285,CUZOMANO,285,It's Cuzomano. Get me Francis.
286,CUZOMANO,286,How'd I hear about this?
287,HANNA,287,"Ridin' the airwaves. On every
news channel. Turn on a fucking
radio!"
288,HANNA,288,"Try to broker the Bonds. Make
some money. Then you'll shift
into Flip-o-matic and tell me
who they are. And what they are

291,CUZOMANO,291,"Yeah, I'm lookin' to handle all
or a piece of the merch. All I
got are yo-yo's. One brings me
a container of Armani suits? He
didn't know they were knockoffs.
Schmuck stole knockoffs. They
should make stupidity a felony."
292,CUZOMANO,292,"You hear who they been downed

293,CHARLENE (V.O.),293,Hello?

302,CHRIS,302,Charlene's going to leave me.
303,NEIL,303,Why?
304,CHRIS,304,"There ain't no steaks in the
freezer."
305,NEIL,305,With everything we been taking?
306,CHRIS,306,"Last trip to Vegas and the
Superbowl took care of that.
When you gonna get an old lady?"
307,NEIL,307,"When I get around to it. You

life you can't walk out on in 30
seconds flat if you spot heat
around the corner."""
314,CHRIS,314,"Jimmy Banghart. And to hell
with Jimmy Banghart."
315,CHRIS,315,"I'd rather go ten rounds with
Jesus Christ than fuck with her.
But she and Dominick save my
life, man; everyday. Everyday..."

354,NEIL,354,"Chris is gonna straighten it up
with you. And you ..."
355,CHARLENE,355,"It's too late! I'm sick of it!
I'm sick of you."
356,NEIL,356,I'm not part of your situation!

358,NEIL,358,"After that, he fucks up, then
okay."
359,NEIL,359,"I will finance setting you up,
separate, myself. Dominick will
go with you. And my word counts.
But right now he is puttin' it
all on the line. So for the

tattoos. Peacock right here.
Probably was a shooter once Heavy

405,HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D),405,"When he moves or sits - like in
a restaurant."
406,HANNA (V.O.),406,"I want pictures of who he moves

got jackets? I want to see who
they move and they sit with and
give them the same treatment."
407,HANNA (V.O.),407,"Bosko. Work the neighborhood.

420,RICHIE,420,"It's fucked up. Somebody inside
knew the girl and called the
family."
421,HANNA,421,"Oh, this is nice."
422,RICHIE,422,"I wanted you to see this 'cause
I got a feeling it's serial and

439,NEIL,439,"""... keep ... the ... money."""
440,VAN ZANT,440,"It's a lot of money!    What are
you doing?"
441,NEIL,441,"What am I doin' I'm talking into
an empty telephone."
442,VAN ZANT,442,I don't understand.
443,NEIL,443,"'Cause there is a dead man on
the other end of this line..."
444,VAN ZANT,444,Who are these people?    Huh?!
445,KELSO (V.O.),445,Yeah?

sometime. Goodbye."
451,NEIL (V.O.),451,"Wait a minute, pal-o!!"
452,NEIL,452,"You're going to wait for me for
a week. I'll buy a week with
the five. It's above and beyond
the fifty and if I wash, you
keep it."
453,NEIL,453,"You're going to wait for me 'cause
you want me to take it down.
You know it's got better odds
with me in."
454,NEIL,454,Now do we have an understanding?
455,KELSO (V.O.),455,Seven days.
456,VOICES,456,"...Happy anniversary to you.
Happy anniversary dear Michael

472,NEIL,472,I got it.
473,HANNA (O.S.),473,A goddamn convention.
474,CASALS (O.S.),474,"Who's ""slick?"""
475,DRUCKER,475,"Cerrito, the wide one. He's
hugged twice. One if he finds
it behind the wheel wall. The
back-up's in the firewall. We
got their plates."
476,CASALS,476,Yeah.
477,DRUCKER,477,"One with the hair is Shiherlis.
Got a revolving tail and a tap

480,HANNA,480,"Next time this crew scores?
When they walk in that door?
They will get the surprise of a
lifetime."
481,NEIL,481,Come away with me.

486,NEIL,486,Soon.
487,EADY,487,You're kidding.
488,NEIL,488,"What's stopping you?     What's
here?"
489,EADY,489,I don't know you.
490,NEIL,490,What's to know?
491,EADY,491,Are you married?
492,NEIL,492,Why?
493,EADY,493,Way you come and go.
494,NEIL,494,"I deal with state officials.
County. Weird hours. A lot of
traveling, entertaining."
495,(beat),495,The last thing I am is married.
496,EADY,496,"You don't know me at all, Neil..."
497,NEIL,497,I know enough.
498,EADY,498,"My father wanted me to marry
someone in Taipei. It was like
I was a piece of furniture: ""Go
be his wife."" After I left he
won't talk to me. Because I
went on my own. I can't let
people tell roe what to do again.
And that trust comes from knowing
someone over time."
499,EADY,499,"This is hard between us for me.
Because I like you very much."
500,NEIL,500,"I have to leave. Come away with
me."
501,(beat),501,"No one will ever tell you what
to do... You'll never lose
yourself with me."
502,PROSTITUTE,502,"Hey, baby."
503,WAINGRO,503,Showed you a good time?     Huh?
504,PROSTITUTE,504,"Oh, yeah.   You fly. You cool."
505,WAINGRO,505,"Don't lie to me. I can always
tell when people lie to me."
506,PROSTITUTE,506,"I ain't lyin'! You a hot dog.
You a cowboy. You hung like a
horse and this was the monster
fuck of my young life."
507,PROSTITUTE,507,Now I gotta get my ass streetside.
508,WAINGRO,508,"You don't have a truth-telling
style."
509,PROSTITUTE,509,The fuck's wrong with you?
510,WAINGRO,510,"You think I'm some john? I'm a
stone killer! I'm a sky-blue
bad ass, bitch!"
511,BARTENDER,511,Once again?
512,WAINGRO,512,"Sure, good buddy. Set it up."
513,WAINGRO,513,I'm looking to get into something.
514,BARTENDER,514,Yeah? Where you been?
515,WAINGRO,515,"Chino, Tracy. I'm a cowboy,
heavy-hitter. Billy Ricketts
said to come see you."
516,BARTENDER,516,"Go see this guy. This guy always
putting guys on."
517,WAINGRO,517,Thanks.

arm!"
519,RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.),519,"Hey, hey!"

groove is strictly Col-trane..."
521,BREEDAN,521,Hey!
522,LILLIAN (O.S.),522,"Let's go, baby."
523,BREEDAN,523,I got any left?
524,LILLIAN,524,"There's other paychecks. You
blow it off. It's worth it,
baby, cause you mess with that
man and you be violated right
back to San Quentin. So you got
to handle it 'til we get you a
different job."
525,BREEDAN,525,"Yeah. That motherfucker ain't
invented the hard time this
gangster can't handle!."
526,BREEDAN,526,"Why you stickin' with me, Lillian?
Why?"
527,LILLIAN,527,"'Cause I'm proud of you.   Proud
you my man."
528,BREEDAN,528,Proud of me?
529,"BREEDAN (CONT'D)
(beat)",529,What you proud of me for?
530,"LILLIAN
(beat)",530,Come on home.
531,BRUCE,531,Okay.
532,BRUCE,532,"Captain Jackson wants to know
what's goin' on."
533,HANNA,533,Nothing. Clear the air.
534,JACKSON,534,Where'd...they...go?
535,HANNA,535,"Fell back to see if the alarm
bypasses held. If they did,
they'll be back. Stay the fuck
off the radio!"
536,HANNA,536,Quiet! !
537,NEIL,537,...We walk.
538,CHRIS,538,"I'm 60 seconds away. It's a rat
or something."
539,NEIL,539,"It is not an animal sound.   We
are out of here."
540,CHRIS,540,We need the cash!!
541,NEIL,541,We walk!! Now.
542,JACKSON,542,"They're leaving. Why are they
leaving?!"
543,JACKSON (O.S.),543,"I can take 'em, now!"
544,HANNA (V.O.),544,Let 'em go.
545,JACKSON (V.O.),545,At least we got 'em on a...
546,HANNA,546,"Let em go. We got nothing! Not
even a burglary. They didn't
fucking steal anything yet.
Don't you get it? All we've
got's breaking and entry."
547,JACKSON (V.O.),547,I'm not letting them walk!
548,HANNA,548,"The fuck you aren't! That's
exactly what you are gonna do.
It's my investigation. And my
authority supersedes your rank!
And I am not settling for some
chicken shit misdemeanor!"
549,HANNA,549,Back to work.
550,MARCIANO,550,"What can I do for you guys?
Ignores his hand and shoves him
back into his office chair with
an open hand."
551,MARCIANO,551,"L.A.P.D. Who the hell you think
you're pushing around? You got
no jurisdiction and I know people
here!"
552,SCHWARTZ,552,"Who? The fucking Tooth Fairy!
So what?"
553,HANNA,553,"You go back to Newark on a New
Jersey warrant for smuggling
cigarettes up from North Carolina
three years ago or you go to
work for us. Cut and dried.
That...is...it."
554,MARCIANO,554,"Oh, my God..."
555,HANNA,555,Charlene Shiherlis.
556,MARCIANO,556,Who?
557,SCHWARTZ,557,"""Who?"" The stranger you been
talkin' dirty to on the telephone
every day for the last month."
558,MARCIANO,558,You can't tie me to her!
559,HANNA,559,"Who has to. You're onna plane
to New Jersey, jagoff."
560,MARCIANO,560,"Oh, man..."
561,MARCIANO,561,"Why did I get mixed up with that
bitch?"
562,HANNA,562,"'Cause she's got a great ass and
you goT your head all the way up
it."
563,MARCIANO,563,So?
564,HANNA,564,"So it's no big thing. I don't
even want her. You can have
her, after. I want her husband
and all his buddies; that's all.
And you're gonna help."
565,NEIL,565,"LAPD? The G? What? Where the
hell did this heat come from?"
566,CHRIS,566,"Maybe it's only the EMA score,
not us."
567,NEIL,567,Wake up!
568,(beat),568,"Assume they got our phones, our
houses bugged, I beepers on all
the cars. We got major problems..
Where's Cerrito?"
569,NEIL (O.S.),569,Recognize the cook?
570,CHRIS,570,No.
571,NEIL,571,"D Block. San Q. Did a nickel on
armed robbery."
572,NEIL (O.S.),572,"Hey, David.     How you doing?"
573,BREEDAN,573,"Hey, Homeboy! All right!"
574,BREEDAN,574,How bout you?
575,NEIL,575,Gettin' by. You okay?
576,BREEDAN,576,"Yeah. Temporary. Know what I
mean?"
577,NEIL,577,Sure.   See you around.
578,NEIL,578,What took you so long?
579,CERRITO,579,"My car. Bugs. Two of 'em.
Count 'em. One in the wheel
well. Second behind the fire
wall. Night of the party? I
dropped Elaine and swung by EMA
to check out the junction box..."
580,CHRIS,580,"Without the platinum how do we
buy the bank score?"
581,NEIL,581,"I cash in T-bills to pay-off
Kelso. That's not our problem."
582,CERRITO,582,"What the hell happened to Van
Zant and our 750?"
583,NEIL,583,"With the heat we got, you wanna
play World War Two in the streets
with Van Zant?"
584,CERRITO,584,Van Zant gets a pass?!
585,NEIL,585,"Fuck Van Zant. I got more
motivation to whack him than you
do. He is a luxury. Our problem
is: jam and take the bank or
split."
586,(beat),586,"And I mean right fucking now.
Do not go home, pack, nothing.
Thirty seconds from now we are
on the road. Gone."
587,CHRIS,587,"For me, the bank's worth the
stretch. I say accept the risk,
stay."
588,NEIL,588,Michael?
589,CERRITO,589,I roll with you. Whatever...
590,NEIL,590,"Not on this one, Michael. On
this one you make up your own
mind."
591,CERRITO,591,"...you figure this the best thing
to do?"
592,NEIL,592,"I got some plans. To go away
after. So for me, it's worth
the stretch."
593,NEIL,593,"But, Elaine takes good care of
you. You got plenty put away.
T. Bonds; real estate. If I
were you, I'd be smart and cut
loose of this."
594,CERRITO,594,"Hey. To me the action's half
the juice anyway. I'm in."
595,NEIL,595,All right.   All right.
596,CERRITO,596,That the place?
597,NEIL,597,"Yeah. You see how the road leads
back around?"
598,CERRITO,598,Yeah.
599,NEIL,599,That's the escape route...
600,SCHWARTZ (O.S.),600,This is it.
601,CASALS,601,I know.   Let's go!
602,HANNA (O.S.),602,"What are they taking down out
here?"
603,CASALS,603,"They were looking at something
southwest..."
604,HANNA,604,What's's that down there?
605,CASALS,605,"An auto parts company. They're
going to knock over a payroll?"
606,SCHWARTZ,606,The company only pays by check.
607,HANNA,607,"Maybe they're gonna steal the
hub caps ..."
608,HANNA,608,"A billboard. Oil pumps.     What
the hell's goin' on?"
609,SCHWARTZ,609,"That's what we were trying to
figure."
610,HANNA,610,"I got an idea what they're looking
at. You know what they're looking
at?"
611,HANNA,611,"Is that guy something; or is
that guy something? I mean, you
gotta give this crew credit.
They are so fucking good..."
612,(beat),612,Know what he's looking at?
613,HANNA,613,"Us. The L.A.P.D. The Police
Department. We just got made..."
614,NATE,614,Worth it?
615,NEIL,615,"There's enough circuit diagrams
and blueprints here to build the
bank."
616,(beat),616,It's terrific.
617,NATE,617,"His name is Hanna; first name,
Vincent. I smeared this sergeant
in vice five yards. Hanna's all
over you. He's a hot dog.
Lieutenant in major Crimes Unit.
He's taken down some heavy crews.
Blew away Frankie Yonder in
Chicago and he was a fucking
maniac. Was working Narcotics
before that. He's good, Neil.
Dedicated. Divorced three times.
Current wife's Justine. He's
why the extra heat."
618,NATE,618,"Vice sergeant says Hanna likes
you. Thinks you're some kind of
'star.' 'You do this sharp, you
do that sharp. Look how sharp
this guy is to figure that.'"
619,NATE,619,Funny as a heart attack.
620,NATE,620,"With this guy and this much heat,
you should pass on the bank."
621,NEIL,621,I've had heat before.
622,NATE,622,That's not the point.
623,NEIL,623,This one's worth the stretch
624,NATE,624,You sure?
625,NEIL,625,I'm sure.   Drop me at the garage.
626,HUGH,626,Hear from him yet?
627,VAN ZANT,627,Not a thing.
628,HUGH,628,Maybe he went away.
629,VAN ZANT,629,Yeah. Sure.
630,(beat),630,Not hearing bothers me more...
631,(beat),631,Where's this guy?
632,HUGH,632,"This guy here...we put him on.
Turns out he knows McCauley."
633,WAINGRO,633,Waingro. My name's Waingro.
634,VAN ZANT,634,"I been living in this office day
and night. What's with your
friend?"
635,WAINGRO,635,"I know all about how he thinks.
We took some major scores
together. He's probably busy
right now. But he's real
thorough. He won't forget you..."
636,VAN ZANT,636,That's reassuring.
637,WAINGRO,637,"Yeah, I got some moves I could
make here, that could be a big
help to you..."
638,HANNA,638,Justine?
639,HANNA,639,Where we going?
640,HANNA,640,Where are you going?
641,JUSTINE,641,Out.
642,HANNA,642,You know I'm on you.    Let's talk.
643,NEIL,643,Sure. Buy me a cup of coffee.
644,HANNA,644,"Seven years in San Quentin. In
the hole for three. McNeil before
that."
645,NEIL,645,Yeah.
646,HANNA,646,Was McNeil as tough as they say?
647,NEIL,647,"You looking to become a
penologist?"
648,HANNA,648,"You looking to go back? I chased
some crews, the guys were lookin'
to fuck up and get busted back."
649,NEIL,649,"You must have worked some dipshit
crews."
650,HANNA,650,I worked all kinds.
651,NEIL,651,"You see me doing thrill-seeker
liquor store holdups with a ""Born
to Lose"" tattoo on my chest?"
652,HANNA,652,"No, I do not."
653,NEIL,653,Right.   And I...
654,NEIL (CONT'D),654,I am never going back.
655,HANNA,655,Then don't take down scores.
656,NEIL,656,"I do what I do best. I take
scores. You do what you do best
trying to stop guys like me."
657,HANNA,657,"You never wanted a normal-type
life?"
658,NEIL,658,"What the fuck is that?    Barbecues
and ballgames?"
659,HANNA,659,That's part of it.
660,NEIL,660,That's nice.     That your life?
661,HANNA,661,"No. My wife spends half her
time on the couch. My
stepdaughter's got problems 'cause
her real father's a world class
asshole. And every moment I
got, I'm chasing guys like you."
662,NEIL,662,"A man told me once: you want to
make moves? Don't keep anything
in your life you're not willing
to walk out on in 30 seconds
flat if you feel the heat around
the corner."
663,NEIL,663,"So if you're chasing me and you
gotta move when I move, how do
you expect to keep a family?"
664,HANNA,664,"What are you, a monk?"
665,NEIL,665,No.
666,NEIL,666,I got a woman.
667,HANNA,667,What do you tell her?
668,NEIL,668,She thinks I sell swimming pools.
669,HANNA,669,"And if you spot me around the
corner. You gonna walk out on
her? Leave her flat? Like that?
Not even say goodbye?"
670,NEIL,670,That's the discipline.
671,HANNA,671,"What you're left with is pretty
empty."
672,NEIL,672,Yeah?
673,(beat),673,"Then maybe you and me, we should
both go do somethin' else, pal."
674,HANNA,674,"I don't know how to do anything
else."
675,NEIL,675,...neither do I.
676,HANNA,676,And I don't much want to.
677,NEIL,677,Neither do I.
678,HANNA,678,"We're sitting here like a coupla
regular fellas. You do what you
do. I do what I gotta do. What
happens if I am there and I got
to put you away?"
679,HANNA,679,"I won't like it. But, if it's
between you and some poor bastard
whose wife you're going to make
into a widow, brother, you are
gonna go down. 'Cause you don't"
680,HANNA (CONT'D),680,"have to be there. You coulda
gone and been a... a mailman."
681,NEIL,681,"There's a flip side to that coin.
What if you got me boxed in and
I gotta put you down?"
682,(beat),682,"'Cause no matter what, you will
not get in my way."
683,(beat),683,"But now that we been face to
face, I would not feel good about
that. But I won't hesitate.
Not for one second."
684,HANNA,684,"Maybe it'll happen that way.    Or
who knows ..."
685,NEIL,685,"...maybe we'll never see each
other again."
686,HANNA,686,Can we have the bill.
687,DRUCKER,687,They dumped us!
688,HANNA,688,What?
689,DRUCKER,689,They dumped us.
690,HANNA,690,I was just with him!
691,DRUCKER,691,With who?
692,HANNA,692,"Whattaya mean, ""they dumped us""?!"
693,DRUCKER,693,"Chris slipped his tail.      And
Chris doesn't talk about     jobs
with Charlene so there's     nothing
for Marciano to get from     her."
694,HANNA,694,Cerrito?
695,CASALS,695,"Disappeared. No calls to the
house. Not home."
696,HANNA,696,Locators on their cars?!
697,CASALS,697,"Cerrito dumped his on a UPS van.
Surveillance tailed a UPS van to
Oxnard."
698,HANNA,698,They dumped all our tails?!!
699,CASALS,699,Yeah.
700,HANNA,700,"I had coffee with McCauley half
an hour ago. What happened?"
701,CASALS,701,"Our tail saw you. McCauley pulled
into a car wash. Car came out.
He didn't."
702,HANNA,702,"Does anybody have Any     idea where
the fuck these people     are at?
'Cause whatever they     are gonna
do, they are doing it     right now!"
703,NEIL,703,"Got it. it's eighteen inches
in."
704,NEIL,704,"Where the hell's Towner? I wanted
to pass by early. I want to
check the slot for the work car."
705,SOLENKO,705,"How long those guys been sitting
back there?"
706,CASHIER,706,Hour or so...
707,SOLENKO,707,They think this a hotel?
708,SOLENKO (O.S.),708,"Twenty minutes, then I toss their
asses out of here."
709,BREEDAN,709,"You spell me? I didn't take my
break yet ..."
710,SOLENKO,710,"That spic, Cisco Kid, whatever,
didn't show. After the lunch
rush, haul out the garbage and
mop the back. Take your break
later."
711,CERRITO,711,Here he is.
712,TOWNER,712,Hey!   I'm out! I can't go.
713,NEIL,713,What are you talking about?
714,TOWNER,714,"Anna's got a perforated appendix.
We took her to the hospital."
715,TOWNER (CONT'D),715,"They're operating right now.
It's a mess. I got to get back
there..."
716,NEIL,716,What the hell I do for a driver?!
717,TOWNER,717,"Look, I got her sister there,
waiting at the hospital. I came
over 'cause I didn't want to
talk on the phone."
718,TOWNER,718,"I got to get back. Last thing
I'd do is let you down, Neil..."
719,NEIL,719,"What do you call this?    Backing
me up?"
720,TOWNER,720,"I waited too long trying to get
past today! So now maybe she
got peritonitis."
721,(beat),721,I got to be there...
722,CHRIS,722,What the fuck do we do now?
723,NEIL,723,"Here comes your second chance
for a change of luck..."
724,BREEDAN,724,Yeah?
725,NEIL,725,"Need a driver. Remember the
drill?"
726,BREEDAN,726,Yeah.   When?
727,NEIL,727,To-day.
728,BREEDAN,728,You're on.
729,NEIL,729,Out back in five.
730,SOLENKO,730,Where the fuck you going?
731,WAINGRO (O.S.),731,They buy it?
732,TOWNER,732,Yeah.
733,WAINGRO,733,"I got to hand it to you, sport.
You're slick, pal smart how you
handled all this. On the ball.
Yeah."
734,TOWNER,734,Thanks. Where's Anna?
735,WAINGRO,735,"She's resting. It's going down
anyway? On schedule?"
736,TOWNER,736,That's right.
737,WAINGRO,737,Make the call.
738,TOWNER,738,Where's she?
739,WAINGRO,739,I dunno.
740,TOWNER,740,"Know what happens when Neil finds
out? To both of us?"
741,WAINGRO,741,"I know what's gonna happen.
Nothing's gonna happen. 'Cause I
got it master minded. I got it
jammed. This is solid. Take it
from the kid."
742,TOWNER,742,You hope.
743,TOWNER,743,"What do you mean, you don't know
where she is?"
744,TOWNER,744,Anna?
745,WAINGRO,745,...showing her a good time.
746,NEIL (O.S.),746,There's the slot.
747,BREEDAN,747,"Looks right. Come out the door,
your angle takes you into the
car. Don't have to run around
the doors. You want them open?"
748,NEIL,748,"No. 'Cause time is not a problem.
And I want nothing to look weird."
749,BREEDAN,749,Po-lice response time?
750,NEIL,750,There is none.
751,BREEDAN,751,Why?
752,CHRIS,752,"Cause we bypassed all the alarms
last night."
753,CHRIS,753,"For you this whole gig is a slow
cruise down Hawthorne..."
754,NEIL,754,"Drop us in the slot.   Let's take
it down."
755,DIETER,755,"Hey, Casals. I got this tip
phoned in about this bank. It
mean anything to you?"
756,CASALS,756,Vincent! Vincent!
757,WIDE,757,"Hanna comes up, coffee in his
hand."
758,CASALS,758,"Commercial Bank! Wilmington!

760,JOHN,760,Hi!
761,NEIL,761,Hi!
762,JOHN,762,Sure thing!
763,CERRITO,763,"Say, Frank...?"
764,NEIL,764,"Ladies and gentlemen!  We are
holding up this bank."
765,NEIL,765,"We want to hurt nobody.  You do
exactly like we say and you come
away okay. We're here  for the
bank's money, not your money..."
766,NEIL,766,"...you people behind the windows:
the salaries this bank pays aren't
big enough to take risks for, so
think of your take-home pay before
you risk your life."
767,NEIL,767,"...don't forget your money is
insured by the Federal Government.
You're not going to lose a penny.
Relax and you'll get through
this okay."
768,NEIL (CONT'D),768,"Any of the ladies feel ill or
anybody with heart trouble wants
to sit down, go right ahead."
769,NEIL,769,The key.
770,TIMMONS,770,What key?
771,NEIL,771,"Don't touch your face.   Let it
bleed."
772,SCHWARTZ,772,"Too many people. This isn't how
to handle it"
773,SCHWARTZ,773,"Vincent! Fuck this crew! Let

784,DOC,784,"Blood loss and shock and he'll
have a lot of pain in the shoulder
and back, but I'll give you
quarter-grain phials of morphine.
Subcutaneous injections."
785,NEIL,785,What's the bottom line?
786,DR. BOB,786,"Missed the carotid artery by
millimeters. There is mostly
tissue damage. And the collar a
bone's smashed. Can he rest
awhile?"
787,NEIL,787,"Six, seven hours.   What do I owe
you?"
788,DR. BOB,788,It's got to be twenty thou.
789,NEIL,789,What is this?
790,DR. BOB,790,"You're number one with a bullet
on the six o'clock news. It's
at least double the risk. So
I'm doubling my price."
791,NEIL,791,"You're wrong. It's four times
the risk. 'Cause something happens
to him, I'm coming back for you.
And I'm double the worst trouble
you ever had."
792,NEIL,792,I'll be back for you.
793,CHRIS,793,Charlene? Get her out!
794,NEIL,794,"First, I got to know if our escape
route got ratted-out along with
everything else."
795,CHRIS,795,Who...
796,NEIL,796,Who wasn't around Towner.
797,ELAINE (O.S.),797,Get out of my way!

there."
809,PLAINCLOTHESMAN,809,Let's get you on that plane.
810,NEIL,810,Who?
811,TOWNER,811,Made me...Anna...?
812,NEIL,812,She's dead...
813,(beat),813,"So's Cerrito and Breedan...the
guy who stood in...for you."
814,(beat),814,Who did this...?
815,TOWNER,815,They had Anna.

817,TOWNER,817,Waingro.
818,NEIL,818,Waingro?    On his own?
819,TOWNER,819,"Uh-uh. For someone.     The other

834,NATE (V.O.),834,You got the time...?
835,NEIL,835,I'll make time.
836,(beat),836,"I need a new ""out"" laid on."
837,NATE (V.O.),837,Do you know it's blown?
838,NEIL,838,How can I trust it?
839,EADY (V. 0.),839,Hello?
840,NEIL,840,"Things are screwed up. You're
not flying out after me. We go
together."
841,NEIL (CONT'D),841,"You and me got to straighten
something up first. I'll be by
later."
842,EADY (V. 0.),842,What's wrong? Neil?
843,VKN ZANT (O.S.),843,Who is it?
844,NEIL,844,Waingro.   Where is he?
845,VAN ZANT,845,How the hell should I know?
846,NEIL (O.S.),846,How much?
847,NATE,847,"$165,000."
848,NEIL (O.S.),848,That's a rip-off.
849,NATE,849,"You want   a good getaway and you're
hot with   a big score in your
pocket.    You're a media event.
What the   fuck do you expect?"
850,NEIL,850,What do I get for those dollars?
851,NATE,851,"You end up in Ireland with good
papers and plastic."
852,NEIL,852,Via what?
853,NATE,853,"Lear jet to Vancouver. Then
commercial to Reykjavik; then
Dublin."
854,NEIL,854,Reliable?
855,NATE,855,"For those   bucks? 100 per cent.
I got the   plastic on me. The
passports   will be on the plane.
Who's the   third?"
856,NEIL,856,A girl. With her own papers.
857,NEIL,857,What are these good for?
858,NATE,858,Forty-five to sixty days.
859,NEIL,859,How soon?
860,NATE,860,Twenty-four hours.
861,NEIL,861,Make it twelve.
862,NATE,862,"You're going for an important
ride. If they say twenty-four
for it to be right, then it's
twenty-four!"
863,NEIL,863,You checked all around?
864,NATE,864,All around.
865,(beat),865,"You and I go way back, kiddo, I
bought you the best."
866,NEIL,866,Where's the pick-up?
867,NATE,867,"Santa Monica Airport. They're a
legit operation. I won't have
details until tomorrow morning."
868,NATE,868,What is it?
869,NEIL,869,"Kelso's share. Ten per cent.
$400,000. That's less the 50
advance. The other bag was with
Cerrito."
870,HANNA,870,"You stick with the Charlene
Shiherlis piece."
871,FARINA,871,"Marciano's on a plane in here
from, Las Vegas to pick her up.
We got a house I set.."
872,HANNA,872,"Maybe Chris or Neil will come
for her. Frankly, I doubt it."
873,HANNA,873,"You work Neil's transport from
here on the phones."
874,DRUCKER,874,"McCauley's gotta be gone. He
hadda have a getaway planned."
875,HANNA,875,"And now he's gotta get a new
one! Would you trust it after
this afternoon?"
876,(beat),876,"Someone, somewhere's agenting it
for him. That's a main track.
We got Shiherlis setting up.
That's a main track. I want
more."
877,FARINA,877,How much time we got?
878,HANNA,878,"Eight, ten, twelve hours. For
him to set up a new out. After
that? He's gone. Bam! Bye-
bye."
879,HANNA,879,"He's the burglary cop with the
""terrific tip?"""
880,BOSKO,880,Yeah.
881,DIETER,881,Who are you?
882,HANNA,882,Hanna.   Where'd it come from?
883,DIETER,883,"I got my informants.      Just like
you got..."
884,HANNA,884,"I got Schwartz. Dead. Casals
got no liver. He's dying. Don't
come on to me with ""confidential
source"" crap!"
885,DIETER,885,"Hugh. Hugh Benny.       He gives me
tips...!"
886,HANNA,886,"Who ratted-out McCauley?     C'mon!
Who? You?"
887,CHARLENE,887,Whose side are you on?
888,MARCIANO,888,I'm on yours.
889,CHARLENE,889,"You slimy piece of shit.     What a
joke."
890,MARCIANO,890,"You told me you want out from
under? You're scared to death
of Neil. You wanted out? This
is out!"
891,CHARLENE,891,What's your end?
892,MARCIANO,892,"You dump broad! How'd I get
into this?"
893,FARINA,893,"Hey, hey!     Go easy on the lady!"
894,MARCIANO,894,Huh?
895,FARINA,895,"You heard me. She had a rough
ride."
896,(beat),896,"Go mix her a drink. Cabinet
above the sink."
897,MARCIANO,897,Fuck her.
898,FARINA,898,Get the fuck in there!
899,FARINA,899,"He's right. And you know it.
You think you'd be betraying
Chris?"
900,CHARLENE,900,Yes.
901,FARINA,901,"Well, you're right. You would
be. But if you don't betray
Chris, you betray Dominick.
Because he becomes an orphan
when you go to prison as an
accessory 'cause you got no living
parents to take him. Then he
ends up state-raised and fucked
for life. Your son Dominick's
innocent. He didn't choose a
life like that. Chris did."
902,FARINA,902,"Give up Chris. You get off clean.
Do it for your kid."
903,FARINA,903,"Vincent. It's me. We're set
here. She'll make the call."
904,CHARLENE,904,"I'm going to give you an address
of where I'm staying. Could you
get it to Chris?"
905,HANNA,905,Okay.
906,DRUCKER (O.S.),906,M. C. U.
907,HANNA,907,"It's me. Tracks back to this
union guy, Van Zant. He had
some beef with Neil. Neil already
settled it. Van Zant got dead
earlier tonight."
908,HANNA,908,"Now Hugh Benny has reformed his
wayward life and become a born-
again good citizen. So, he's
revealed the key player is this
cowboy Waingro. Used to be part
of Neil's crew. Waingro committed
a double murder today on Towner,
a driver, and his old lady."
909,HANNA,909,"Meanwhile Waingro's checked into
the Airport Hyatt House under
""Jamieson."" Maybe Neil will make
a move on him, but not likely."
910,HANNA,910,"Get the word to bailbondsmen,
bookies, snitches in County,
etc. where Waingro is. And get
a team down there to set it up."
911,DRUCKER (V.O.),911,Want me to do it?
912,HANNA,912,"No. You stay on who's agenting
Neil's getaway. What have you
got?"
913,DRUCKER (V.O.),913,Nothing yet.
914,HANNA,914,"He's here. He's still here.    I
can feel it."
915,BERRYMAN,915,For how long?
916,HANNA,916,"Eight, ten hours max."
917,EADY,917,What did you do?
918,EADY,918,Was that you?
919,NEIL,919,It's what I don't do.
920,(beat),920,"I don't sell swimming pools. It
would have been okay. You would
have flown out after. You didn't
need to do a thing. Now I'm
jammed. We got to go together.
Because we get dropped in a place
and then I decide: New Zealand
or Brazil or Tunisia, whatever.
I can't leave a string back here
to where I am."
921,EADY,921,What.
922,NEIL,922,"I rob and steal for a living.
Do you understand?"
923,EADY,923,You killed people?
924,NEIL,924,"If they got in the way.    Yes.
It's their problem."
925,EADY,925,"The woman on the grass...where
her husband got shot.."
926,NEIL,926,Elaine Cerrito.
927,NEIL,927,"Michael Cerrito's wife. Michael
was my friend. He knew the risks.
He didn't have to be there. He
coulda been a...been a mailman."
928,EADY,928,I don't believe it.
929,NEIL,929,Believe it.
930,NEIL,930,"Eady. Get packed.     Get dressed.
Let's go."
931,NEIL,931,Eady! !
932,EADY,932,"Why you do this to me!    What I
do to you?!"
933,NEIL,933,Shut up!
934,NEIL,934,"Use these credit cards. They
say ""Mr. and Mrs."" I reserved
the car. Buy me some clothes.
Here's a list. I can't go home
for my stuff. Can you do it?"
935,EADY,935,When's it over?
936,NEIL,936,"Twenty-two hours. Then we fly
out of here...clean."
937,EADY,937,"I want you to let me go.     When
will you let me go?"
938,NEIL,938,"You can go now. There's the
door, you want out..."
939,EADY,939,"No, I have to do what you say.
But will you let me leave after?"
940,NEIL,940,It will be different...
941,JUSTINE (O.S.),941,It's ready...
942,JUSTINE,942,Oh. Meet Vincent.
943,RALPH,943,"Excuse me. You didn't tell me
you were..."
944,RALPH,944,"Oh, my God..."
945,HANNA,945,What's your name?
946,RALPH,946,I should....Ralph...I'm...
947,HANNA,947,I'm Vincent Hanna.
948,JUSTINE,948,Don't you even get angry?
949,HANNA,949,I'm angry.
950,HANNA,950,"Ralph, you can ball my wife.
You can lounge around her $1.7
million condominium on her sofa.
You can do all those things.
But you do not get to watch my
fucking TV...!"
951,HANNA,951,"I've never screwed around. I've
been true blue to you since the
day we met."
952,JUSTINE,952,"It would have been preferable if
you had! You made me do this!"
953,HANNA,953,"Right I had Ralph fuck you 'cause
it makes me feel so good."
954,JUSTINE,954,"Put down the television. You
look ridiculous."
955,JUSTINE,955,"Dr. Prince says I'm trying to
get your attention. Christ! I
have to pay someone to figure
out my life with you."
956,RALPH,956,Maybe I should...
957,HANNA,957,Shut up!
958,JUSTINE,958,"Why's it my job to figure it all
out and explain it to you?"
959,HANNA,959,"'Cause you're the one who spends
all the time on the couch."
960,JUSTINE,960,And what do you do?
961,HANNA,961,"What do I do? I speak the English
language. Words. Sentences
even."
962,JUSTINE,962,How admirable: proletarian candor.
963,HANNA,963,Thank you.
964,JUSTINE,964,"Except you don't say a damned
thing. You neglect me. You
don't call. I can worry about
you or not. So I withdraw. You
don't notice. You're walking
through our life chloroformed,
Vincent. Wake up. It's almost
over."
965,NATE,965,"I got Cerrito's share deposited
in the Delaware Trust for Elaine.
She's pretty bad..."
966,NATE,966,"Passports. Traveler's checks.
Plastic."
967,NATE,967,"Hangar 17. Plane call letters
are 1011 Sierra. Touches down,
holds for five minutes and splits.
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed flight plan. The works."
968,NATE (CONT'D),968,"Here's the address Charlene said
she was at. But I don't have
documents for her."
969,CHRIS,969,I'm not flying. I'm drivin'.
970,NATE,970,Fly. Send for her later.
971,NATE,971,Can't you talk to him?
972,NEIL,972,I been trying.
973,NATE,973,"Talk to you in three hours in
case there's changes."
974,NEIL,974,"Use the Camaro. Its clean and
will stand a DMV check."
975,CHRIS,975,How you getting around?
976,NEIL,976,Someone's picking me up.
977,CHRIS,977,A girl on the side?
978,NEIL,978,"See you, cowboy."
979,CHRIS,979,"So long, brother."
980,EADY,980,Clothes are in the trunk.
981,NEIL,981,Any trouble?
982,EADY,982,No.   When's it over?
983,NEIL,983,Six hours. 8 p.m.
984,NEIL,984,"I'll buy you lunch. Everything's
smooth. We're going to fly
away..."
985,FARINA,985,Not a thing. What about you?
986,HANNA,986,Someone's agenting Neil's stuff?
987,HANNA (CONT'D),987,"Who? The Tooth Fairy? Talk to
you later."
988,HANNA,988,"...how did Charlene get the Marina
address passed to Chris?"
989,HANNA,989,"I don't believe I didn't think
of this."
990,HANNA,990,Farina?
991,NATE (V.O.),991,Yeah?
992,NEIL,992,Hi ya.
993,NATE (V. 0.),993,You okay?
994,NEIL,994,"Yeah, Breedan's end?"
995,NATE,995,"Still can't find nobody. It's
in the Delaware Trust. You tell
me later what to do. And about
your ride. No changes. Right
on schedule."
996,NEIL,996,Okay...
997,NATE (V. 0.),997,"By the by: I heard your pal is
checked into the Airport Hyatt
under ""Jamieson""...if you still
care..."
998,NATE (V.O.),998,"I figured you wouldn't waste the
time."
999,NEIL,999,You figured right.
1000,NEIL,1000,"Take it easy, old man."
1001,NATE,1001,"You take it easy. Be careful,
huh?"
1002,NEIL,1002,That was the last bridge.
1003,HANNA,1003,"He blows out of here, you'll do
his time. I want..."
1004,NATE,1004,"Screw what you want.    Who the
fuck are you?"
1005,HANNA,1005,"Your worst nightmare.    Hard time,
Nate!"
1006,NATE,1006,"I ain't looking at shit, and you
know it! So don't con me."
1007,BOSKO,1007,I'll work him...
1008,NATE,1008,Go ahead!
1009,HANNA,1009,Don't touch him!
1010,HANNA,1010,"Accessory. Armed robbery and
murder one. Dealing stolen
merchandise and securities. You
agent for Neil. At least the
armored car and bank. Everything
I tie him into, I tie you into.
Two cops dead. Other bodies on
the sidewalk. You understand
that kind of heat? You fucking
get it!"
1011,NATE,1011,Neil who...?
1012,HANNA,1012,"Book him on Accessory to Armed
Robbery, Murder One, A.D.W., and
Trafficking Stolen Merchandise."
1013,HANNA,1013,"The Nazi's in Quentin will turn
your ass into a satchel. You're
an old man. Gimme Neil!"
1014,NATE,1014,"What I'll give you is so many
false arrest lawsuits, you won't
have time to write traffic
tickets!"
1015,HANNA,1015,Get me Farina.
1016,DRUCKER,1016,Can we put Nate away?
1017,HANNA,1017,"With a staff of five or six
marshaling physical evidence for
six months after two years' worth
of continuances...maybe he'll do
18 months. Won't fucking happen."
1018,HANNA,1018,Check the bait.
1019,BOSKO,1019,Waingro?
1020,HANNA,1020,Yeah.   At the hotel.
1021,NEIL,1021,Look over there.
1022,NEIL,1022,"I don't even know how to think
like this...cause this has
happened to me late in my life.
But I got some expectations.
For us. You can walk right now
if you want. Walk away. Or
you...on your own...you choose
to come with me. I got enough
in there to take care of us for
forever."
1023,NEIL,1023,Eady.
1024,NEIL,1024,Eady?
1025,COP #6 (V.O.),1025,"Richie. A possible moved into
the zone."
1026,COP #5 (V.O.),1026,We got him.
1027,FARINA (V.O.),1027,I copy.
1028,FARINA (V.O.),1028,Got a live one.
1029,HANNA,1029,I'll hold.
1030,FARINA,1030,"C'mon, sugar: show yourself"
1031,MARCIANO,1031,Do it!
1032,FARINA,1032,Shut up!!
1033,FARINA,1033,"One second at the window.   Then
it's all over..."
1034,CHARLENE,1034,"looks at Farina. She slowly
crosses to the window. Marciano
has faded to the back of the
room."
1035,CHARLENE,1035,"For Christ's sake...that's not
even him. That's not Chris."
1036,CHRIS,1036,"Any of you guys know anything
for rent around here?"
1037,BASKETBALL PLAYER #1,1037,"Alberiz's grocery on Dell Avenue
got cards on the wall."
1038,FARINA,1038,"Unit two. This is command.
Take him at the street. Check
him out."
1039,UNIT TWO (V.O.),1039,10-4.
1040,MARCIANO,1040,Where the hell is he?
1041,CHARLENE,1041,Maybe he's not coming.
1042,MARCIANO,1042,"You better hope he shows! Or
you're going to the can, you two
dollar..."
1043,FARINA,1043,Get him the hell out of here!
1044,UNIT TWO (V.O.),1044,Command.
1045,FARINA,1045,Yeah?
1046,UNIT TWO (V.O.),1046,"This guy's  John Pearson. Valid
I.D. car's  registered to one
Bukowski.   Ran a make to DMV.
It's clean.   So's the car."
1047,FARINA,1047,Let him go.
1048,FARINA,1048,"Want a cup of coffee while we
wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?"
1049,CHARLENE,1049,That would be nice.
1050,FARINA (V.O.),1050,"False alarm, Lieutenant."
1051,HANNA (V.O.),1051,What's the score?
1052,DESK CLERK/COP,1052,On this Waingro?
1053,DESK CLERK/COP (CONT'D),1053,"I just told Bosko. Zero.
Nothing's happening."
1054,HANNA,1054,You know what?
1055,(beat),1055,"Neil's gone. Bam!   Flyin' like'
a bird."
1056,BOSKO,1056,"C'mon! How do you know?   We
still got..."
1057,HANNA,1057,What do we got?
1058,HANNA,1058,"Bon voyage, motherfucker, you
were good."
1059,HANNA,1059,"I'm going to the hotel. I'm
gonna take a shower. I'm gonna
sleep for a month."
1060,LAUREN,1060,...Daddy?
1061,HANNA,1061,"You're gonna be okay, baby.
Your mommy and me are here.
Everybody's here. We're going
to take care of you. We love
you..."
1062,ORDERLY,1062,Let me take her.
1063,HANNA,1063,I got her.
1064,DOCTOR,1064,Watch her tongue!
1065,HANNA,1065,"She's not epileptic!   This isn't
a seizure."
1066,DOCTOR,1066,5 mg of Thorazine.
1067,HANNA,1067,"You okay, baby?"
1068,RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.),1068,"Hey there, old aware ones, and
you, too, my fair ones ..."
1069,EADY,1069,What is it?
1070,NEIL,1070,Nothing.
1071,RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.),1071,"Brought to you this fine day
which is A-okay!"
1072,NEIL,1072,"I got this errand to run that I
forgot."
1073,EADY,1073,"The airport is right there.    Is
there time?"
1074,NEIL,1074,"Sure. It's a thing I got to
take care of... is all."
1075,NEIL,1075,Leave it running.
1076,NEIL,1076,"...be right back, Eady."
1077,EADY,1077,Neil...?
1078,PAINTER TWO,1078,What's going on?
1079,PAINTER ONE,1079,Nothing.    He's watching TV.
1080,PAINTER TWO,1080,"We going to finish this game or
what?"
1081,OPERATOR (V.O.),1081,Hyatt House.
1082,NEIL,1082,"Hi. It's the kitchen again.
A... ""Jamieson"" ordered a BLT
and they got his room number
screwed up."
1083,OPERATOR (V.O.),1083,They're always doing that.
1084,"(beat)
NEIL",1084,"Thanks, love."
1085,PA (V.O.),1085,"A fire has been reported. Please
leave your rooms now. Proceed
down marked fire exits. Use the
staircases. Do not use the
elevators. This is NOT a drill.
A fire...etc."
1086,PAINTER ONE,1086,"Yeah. Whyn't you call out for
pizza? Sausage, peppers,
onions..."
1087,PAINTER ONE,1087,Hey.
1088,PAINTER TWO,1088,What?
1089,PAINTER ONE,1089,"That chick on the ninth floor
got naked and she's pressing
herself against the glass again."
1090,PAINTER TWO,1090,Let me see.
1091,PAINTER TWO (O.S.),1091,"Oh, boy...!"
1092,OPERATOR (V.O.),1092,Lt. Hanna. Telephone. Lt. Hanna.
1093,HANNA,1093,"Fuck McCauley. You handle it.
Call Bosko and Drucker in. Get
me at the hospital after."
1094,JUSTINE,1094,"...Will things change between
us?"
1095,"HANNA
(beat)",1095,I don't know...
1096,(beat),1096,Probably not...
1097,(beat),1097,"...but I am reminded of how much
I love you. But that may not be
enough."
1098,JUSTINE,1098,"You have to go to work, don't
you?"
1099,HANNA,1099,Yeah.
1100,JUSTINE,1100,"Be careful, Vincent. Be very
careful..."
1101,(beat),1101,Let's keep on trying?
1102,WAINGRO (O.S.),1102,Yeah?
1103,NEIL,1103,"I'm hotel security. We're
evacuating the floor."
1104,WAINGRO (O.S.),1104,I can't leave.
1105,NEIL,1105,"Sir, I'm afraid you'll have to."
1106,NEIL,1106,"I should have dumped you in that
parking lot. Look at me, you
sick fuck."
1107,NEIL,1107,"Gimme your eyes. 'Cause you're
gonna die."
1108,HANNA,1108,Casals come in.
1109,CASALS (V.O.),1109,"Vincent. I'm in the southeast
stairwell."
1110,HANNA,1110,What's the situation?
1111,CASALS (V.O.),1111,"Three teams are moving up the
other three stairwells to the
14th floor. Elevators are out
of commission because of the
fire alarm. Surveillance said
McCauley looked right at 'em.
Didn't seem surprised."
1112,HANNA,1112,"It means he knew we were here
and came anyway."
1113,CASALS (V.O.),1113,"I got two Special Weapons Teams
deployed at the front and back
exits. Choppers."
1114,HANNA,1114,"Yeah, yeah, that's fine.   Stay
on it. 10-4."
1115,NEIL,1115,...not half bad.
1116,HANNA,1116,...pretty good your own self.
