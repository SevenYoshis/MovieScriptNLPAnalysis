today...I'm playing hockey at two."
1,FIGURE (O.C.),1,"Why don't you call Randal?...
Because I'm fucking tired....I just
closed last night...."
2,FIGURE (O.C.),2,"Jesus...What time are you going to
come in?...Twelve...Be there be
twelve?...Swear..."
3,FIGURE (O.C.),3,"Swear you'll be in by twelve and
I'll do it....Twelve...Twelve or I
walk."
4,DANTE,4,"Next time, I get the bed."
5,DANTE,5,Shit.
6,DANTE,6,Shit.
7,DANTE,7,Shit!
8,DANTE,8,Thanks. Have a good one.
9,ACTIVIST,9,Do you mind if I drink this here?
10,DANTE,10,Sure. Go ahead.
11,CUSTOMER,11,Are you open?
12,DANTE,12,Yeah.
13,CUSTOMER,13,Pack of cigarettes.
14,ACTIVIST,14,Are you sure?
15,CUSTOMER,15,Am I sure?
16,ACTIVIST,16,Are you sure?
17,CUSTOMER,17,Am I sure about what?
18,ACTIVIST,18,"Do you really want to buy those
cigarettes?"
19,CUSTOMER,19,Are you serious?
20,ACTIVIST,20,How long have you been smoking?
21,CUSTOMER,21,"What is this, a poll?"
22,DANTE,22,Beats me.
23,ACTIVIST,23,How long have you been a smoker?
24,CUSTOMER,24,Since I was thirteen.
25,ACTIVIST,25,"I'd say you're about nineteen,
twenty, am I right?"
26,CUSTOMER,26,What the hell is that?
27,ACTIVIST,27,"That's your lung. By this time,
your lung looks like this."
28,CUSTOMER,28,You're shittin' me.
29,ACTIVIST,29,You think I'm shitting you...
30,CUSTOMER,30,What's this?
31,ACTIVIST,31,"It's a trach ring. It's what they
install in your throat when throat
cancer takes your voice box. This
one came out of a sixty-year-old man."
32,CUSTOMER,32,Unnhh!
33,ACTIVIST,33,"He smoked until the day he died.
Used to put the cigarette in this
thing and smoke it that way."
34,DANTE,34,"Excuse me, but..."
35,ACTIVIST,35,"This is where you're heading. A
cruddy lung, smoking through a hole
in your throat. Do you really want
that?"
36,CUSTOMER,36,"Well, if it's already too late..."
37,ACTIVIST,37,"It's never too late. Give those
cigarettes back now, and buy some
gum instead."
38,ACTIVIST,38,Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
39,CUSTOMER,39,It's not the same.
40,ACTIVIST,40,"It's cheaper than cigarettes. And
it certainly beats this."
41,CUSTOMER,41,Jesus!
42,ACTIVIST,42,"It's a picture of a cancer-ridden
lung. Keep it."
43,CUSTOMER,43,I'll just take the gum.
44,DANTE,44,Fifty-five.
45,ACTIVIST,45,"You've made a wise choice. Keep up
the good work."
46,DANTE,46,"Maybe you should take that coffee
outside."
47,ACTIVIST,47,"No, I think I'll drink it in here,
thanks."
48,DANTE,48,"If you're going to drink it in
here, I'd appreciate it if you'd
not bother the customers."
49,ACTIVIST,49,Okay. I'm sorry about that.
50,CUSTOMER,50,Pack of cigarettes.
51,CUSTOMER,51,What's that?
52,ACTIVIST,52,This? How long have you been smoking?
53,JAY,53,WE NEED SOME TITS AND ASS! YEAH!
54,JAY,54,"I feel good today, Silent Bob.
We're gonna make some money! And
then you know what we're going to
do? We're going to go to that party
and get some pussy! I'm gonna fuck
this bitch, that bitch..."
55,JAY,55,I'LL FUCK ANYTHING THAT MOVES!
56,JAY,56,"What you looking at?! I'll kick
your fucking ass!"
57,JAY,57,"Doesn't that motherfucker still owe
me ten bucks?"
58,JAY,58,"Tonight, you and me are going off
that fucker's head, and take out
his fucking soul! Remind me if he
tries to buy something from us, to
cut it with leafs and twigs...or
fucking shit in the motherfucker's
bag!"
59,JAY,59,Wa sup sluts?
60,JAY,60,"Damn Silent Bob! You one rude
motherfucker! But you're cute as
hell."
61,JAY,61,"I wanna go down on you, and suckle
you."
62,JAY,62,"And then, I wanna line up three
more guys, and make like a circus
seal..."
63,JAY,63,"Ewwww!  You fucking faggot! I
fucking hate guys!"
64,JAY,64,I LOVE WOMEN!
65,JAY,65,Neh.
66,GUY,66,You selling?
67,JAY,67,"I got hits, hash, weed, and later
on I'll have 'shrooms. We take
cash, or stolen MasterCard and Visa."
68,ACTIVIST,68,"You're spending what? Twenty,
thirty dollars a week on cigarettes."
69,LISTENER 1,69,Forty.
70,LISTENER 2,70,Fifty-three.
71,ACTIVIST,71,"Fifty-three dollars. Would you pay
someone that much money every week
to kill you? Because that's what
you're doing now, by paying for the
so-called privilege to smoke!"
72,LISTENER 3,72,We all gotta go sometime...
73,ACTIVIST,73,"It's that kind of mentality that
allows this cancer-producing
industry to thrive. Of course we're
all going to die someday, but do we
have to pay for it? Do we have to
actually throw hard-earned dollars
on a counter and say, ""Please,
please, Mister Merchant of Death,
sir; please sell me something that
will give me bad breath, stink up
my clothes, and fry my lungs."""
74,LISTENER 1,74,It's not that easy to quit.
75,ACTIVIST,75,"Of course it's not; not when you
have people like this mindless
cretin so happy and willing to sell
you nails for your coffin!"
76,DANTE,76,"Hey, now wait a sec..."
77,ACTIVIST,77,"Now he's going to launch into his
rap about how he's just doing his
job; following orders."
78,ACTIVIST (CONT'D),78,"Friends, let me tell you about
another bunch of hate mongers that
were just following orders: they
were called Nazis, and they
practically wiped a nation of
people from the Earth...just like
cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette
smoking is the new Holocaust, and
those that partake in the practice
of smoking or sell the wares that
promote it are the Nazis of the
nineties! He doesn't care how many
people die from it! He smiles as
you pay for your cancer sticks and
says, ""Have a nice day."""
79,DANTE,79,I think you'd better leave now.
80,ACTIVIST,80,"You want me to leave? Why? Because
somebody is telling it like it is?
Somebody's giving these fine people
a wake-up call?!"
81,DANTE,81,"You're loitering in here, and
causing a disturbance."
82,ACTIVIST,82,"You're the disturbance, pal! And
here..."
83,ACTIVIST,83,"I'm buying some...what's
this?...Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm
no longer loitering. I'm a customer,
a customer engaged in a discussion
with other customers."
84,LISTENER 2,84,"Yeah, now shut up so he can speak!"
85,ACTIVIST,85,"Oh, he's scared now! He sees the
threat we present! He smells the
changes coming, and the loss of
sales when the nonsmokers finally
demand satisfaction. We demand the
right to breathe cleaner air!"
86,LISTENER 3,86,Yeah!
87,ACTIVIST,87,"We'd rather chew our gum than
embrace slow death! Let's abolish
this heinous practice of sucking
poison, and if it means ruffling
the feathers of a convenience store
idiot, then so be it!"
88,DANTE,88,"That's it, everybody out."
89,ACTIVIST,89,"We're not moving! We have a right,
a constitutional right, to assemble
and be heard!"
90,DANTE,90,"Yeah, but not in here."
91,ACTIVIST,91,"What better place than this? To
stamp it out, you gotta start at
the source!"
92,DANTE,92,"Like I'm responsible for all the
smokers!"
93,ACTIVIST,93,"The ones in this town, yes! You
encourage their growth, their habit.
You're the source in this area, and
we're going to shut you down for
good! For good, cancer-merchant!"
94,CROWD,94,"Cancer merchant! Cancer merchant!
Cancer merchant!"
95,VERONICA,95,Who's leading this mob?
96,SOMEONE,96,That guy.
97,VERONICA (O.C.),97,Freeze.
98,VERONICA,98,Let's see some credentials.
99,VERONICA,99,Slowly...
100,VERONICA,100,"You're a Chewlie's Gum
representative?"
101,VERONICA,101,"And you're stirring up all this
antismoking sentiment
to...what?...sell more gum?"
102,VERONICA,102,Get out of here.
103,VERONICA,103,"And you people: Don't you have jobs
to go to? Get out of here and go
commute."
104,VERONICA,104,"You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
Easily led automatons. Try thinking
for yourself before you pelt and
innocent man with cigarettes."
105,VERONICA,105,"It looked like Tiananmen Square in
here for a second."
106,VERONICA,106,"""Thank you, Veronica; you saved me
from an extremely ugly mob scene."""
107,VERONICA,107,"Okay, champ. What's wrong?"
108,VERONICA,108,"All right, stupid question. But
don't you think you're taking this
a bit too hard?"
109,DANTE,109,"Too hard?! I don't have enough
indignities in my life-people start
throwing cigarettes at me!"
110,VERONICA,110,At least they weren't lit.
111,DANTE,111,I hate this fucking place.
112,VERONICA,112,"Then quit. You should be going to
school anyway..."
113,DANTE,113,"Please, Veronica. Last thing I need
is a lecture at this point."
114,VERONICA,114,"All I'm saying is that if you're
unhappy you should leave."
115,DANTE,115,"I'm not even supposed to be here
today!"
116,VERONICA,116,"I know. I stopped by your house and
your mom said you left at like six
or something."
117,DANTE,117,"The guy got sick and couldn't come
in."
118,VERONICA,118,Don't you have a hockey game at two?
119,DANTE,119,"Yes! And I'm going to play like
shit because I didn't get a good
night's sleep!"
120,VERONICA,120,Why did you agree to come in then?
121,DANTE,121,"I'm only here until twelve, then
I'm gone. The boss is coming in."
122,VERONICA,122,"Why don't you open the shutters and
get some sunlight in here?"
123,DANTE,123,Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
124,VERONICA,124,You're kidding.
125,DANTE,125,Bunch of savages in this town.
126,VERONICA,126,"You look bushed. What time did you
get to bed?"
127,DANTE,127,"I don't know-like two-thirty, three."
128,VERONICA,128,What were you doing up so late?
129,DANTE,129,Hunhh? Nothing.
130,VERONICA,130,What were you doing?
131,DANTE,131,"Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with
you now?"
132,VERONICA,132,"Who's fighting? Why are you so
defensive?"
133,DANTE,133,"Who's defensive? Just...Would you
just hug me?! All right? Your
boyfriend was accosted by an angry
mob, and he needs to be hugged."
134,DANTE,134,What? What is that?
135,VERONICA,135,"She called you, didn't she?"
136,DANTE,136,"Oh, be real! Would you...Would you
please hug me? I just went through
a very traumatic experience and I
haven't been having the best day so
far. Now come on."
137,DANTE,137,"What? What's with that look?! I
wasn't talking to anyone, especially
her! Look at you, being all sort
of...I don't know...stand-offish."
138,DANTE,138,"Fine. You don't trust me, don't hug
me. I see how it is. All right
Pissy-pants, you just go on being
suspicious and quiet. I don't even
want to hug you at this point."
139,DANTE,139,Give you a dollar?
140,DANTE,140,Thanks.
141,VERONICA,141,"How much money did you leave up
there?"
142,DANTE,142,"Like three dollars in mixed change
and a couple of singles. People
only get the paper of coffee this
time of morning."
143,VERONICA,143,You're trusting.
144,DANTE,144,Why do you say that?
145,VERONICA,145,"How do you know they're taking the
right amount of change? Or even
paying for what they take?"
146,DANTE,146,"Theoretically, people see money on
the counter and nobody around, they
think they're being watched."
147,VERONICA,147,"Honesty through paranoia. Why do
you smell like shoe polish?"
148,DANTE,148,"I had to use shoe polish to make
that sign. The smell won't come off."
149,VERONICA,149,"Do you think anyone can see us down
here?"
150,DANTE,150,Why? You wanna have sex or something?
151,VERONICA,151,Ooh! Can we?!
152,DANTE,152,Really?
153,VERONICA,153,I was kidding.
154,DANTE,154,"Yeah, right. You can't get enough
of me."
155,VERONICA,155,Typically male point of view.
156,DANTE,156,How do you figure?
157,VERONICA,157,"You show some bedroom proficiency,
and you think you're gods. What
about what we do for you?"
158,DANTE,158,"Women? Women, as lovers, are all
basically the same: they just have
to be there."
159,VERONICA,159,"""Be there?"""
160,DANTE,160,"Making a male climax is not all
that challenging: insert somewhere
close and preferably moist; thrust;
repeat."
161,VERONICA,161,How flattering.
162,DANTE,162,"Now, making a woman cum...therein
lies a challenge."
163,VERONICA,163,"Oh, you think so?"
164,DANTE,164,"A girl makes a guy cum, it's
standard. A guy makes a girl cum,
it's talent."
165,VERONICA,165,And I actually date you?
166,DANTE,166,Something wrong?
167,VERONICA,167,"I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan,
it takes more than that to get a
guy off. Just ""being there""-as you
put it-is not enough."
168,DANTE,168,I touched a nerve.
169,VERONICA,169,"I'm astonished to hear you
trivialize my role in our sex life."
170,DANTE,170,"It wasn't directed at you. I was
making a broad generalization."
171,VERONICA,171,"You were making a generalization
about ""broads!"""
172,DANTE,172,"These are my opinions based on my
experiences with the few women who
were good enough to sleep with me."
173,VERONICA,173,How many?
174,DANTE,174,How many what?
175,VERONICA,175,How many girls have you slept with?
176,DANTE,176,"How many different girls? Didn't we
already have this discussion once?"
177,VERONICA,177,"We might have; I don't remember.
How many?"
178,DANTE,178,Including you?
179,VERONICA,179,It better be up to and including me.
180,DANTE,180,Twelve.
181,VERONICA,181,"You've slept with twelve different
girls?"
182,DANTE,182,Including you; yes.
183,DANTE,183,What the hell was that for?
184,VERONICA,184,You're a pig.
185,DANTE,185,Why'd you hit me?
186,VERONICA,186,"Do you know how many different men
I've had sex with?"
187,DANTE,187,"Do I get to hit you after you tell
me?"
188,VERONICA,188,Three.
189,DANTE,189,Three?
190,VERONICA,190,Three including you.
191,DANTE,191,"You've only had sex with three
different people?"
192,VERONICA,192,I'm not the pig you are.
193,DANTE,193,Who?
194,VERONICA,194,You!
195,DANTE,195,"No; who were the three, besides me?"
196,VERONICA,196,John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
197,DANTE,197,"Wow. That's great. That's something
to be proud of."
198,VERONICA,198,"I am. And that's why you should
feel like a pig. You men make me
sick. You'll sleep with anything
that says yes."
199,DANTE,199,"Animal, vegetable, or mineral."
200,VERONICA,200,Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
201,DANTE,201,"They put up the least amount of
struggle."
202,VERONICA,202,"After dropping a bombshell like
that, you owe me. Big."
203,DANTE,203,All right. Name it.
204,VERONICA,204,I want you to come with me on Monday.
205,DANTE,205,Where?
206,VERONICA,206,"To school. There's a seminar about
getting back into a scholastic
program after a lapse in enrollment."
207,DANTE,207,"Can't we ever have a discussion
without that coming up?"
208,VERONICA,208,"It's important to me, Dante. You
have so much potential that just
goes to waste in this pit. I wish
you'd go back to school."
209,DANTE,209,"Jesus, would you stop? You make my
head hurt when you talk about this."
210,DANTE,210,Shit! Why are we getting up?
211,VERONICA,211,"Unlike you, I have a class in
forty-five minutes."
212,VERONICA,212,Willam!
213,WILLAM,213,"Ronnie! How are you? You work here
now?"
214,VERONICA,214,"No, I'm just visiting my man."
215,VERONICA,215,"Dante, this is Willam Black."
216,VERONICA,216,"This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend."
217,DANTE,217,How are you? Just the soda?
218,WILLAM,218,And a pack of cigarettes.
219,WILLAM,219,Are you still going to Seton Hall?
220,VERONICA,220,"No, I transferred into Monmouth
this year. I was tired of missing
him."
221,WILLAM,221,Do you still talk to Sylvan?
222,VERONICA,222,"I just talked to her on Monday. We
still hang out on weekends."
223,WILLAM,223,"That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds
take it easy, all right?"
224,VERONICA,224,I will. Take it easy.
225,WILLAM,225,Bye.
226,VERONICA,226,Bye
227,VERONICA,227,That was Snowball.
228,DANTE,228,Why do you call him that?
229,VERONICA,229,"Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job
thing."
230,DANTE,230,What do you mean?
231,VERONICA,231,"After he gets a blow job, he likes
to have the cum spit back into his
mouth while kissing. It's called
snowballing."
232,DANTE,232,He requested this?
233,VERONICA,233,He gets off on it.
234,DANTE,234,Sylvan can be talked into anything.
235,VERONICA,235,Why do you say that?
236,DANTE,236,Like you said-she snowballed him.
237,VERONICA,237,Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
238,DANTE,238,"Yeah, right."
239,VERONICA,239,I'm serious...
240,DANTE,240,You sucked that guy's dick?
241,VERONICA,241,"Yeah. How do you think I know he
liked..."
242,DANTE,242,"But...but you said you only had sex
with three guys! You never mentioned
him!"
243,VERONICA,243,"That's because I never had sex with
him!"
244,DANTE,244,You sucked his dick!
245,VERONICA,245,"We went out a few times. We didn't
have sex, but we fooled around."
246,DANTE,246,"Oh my God! Why did you tell me you
only slept with three guys?"
247,VERONICA,247,"Because I did only sleep with three
guys! That doesn't mean I didn't
just go with people."
248,DANTE,248,Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
249,VERONICA,249,"I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you
understood."
250,DANTE,250,"I did understand! I understand that
you slept with three different
guys, and that's all you said."
251,VERONICA,251,Please calm down.
252,DANTE,252,How many?
253,VERONICA,253,Dante...
254,DANTE,254,How many dicks have you sucked?!
255,VERONICA,255,Let it go...
256,DANTE,256,HOW MANY?
257,VERONICA,257,"All right! Shut up a second and
I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't
freak like this when you told me
how many girls you fucked."
258,DANTE,258,"This is different. This is important.
How many?!"
259,DANTE,259,Well...?
260,VERONICA,260,Something like thirty-six.
261,DANTE,261,WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
262,VERONICA,262,Lower your voice!
263,DANTE,263,"What the hell is that anyway,
""something like thirty-six?"" Does
that include me?"
264,VERONICA,264,Um. Thirty-seven.
265,DANTE,265,I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
266,VERONICA,266,I'm going to class.
267,DANTE,267,Thirty-seven?!
268,DANTE,268,"My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven
dicks!"
269,CUSTOMER,269,In a row?
270,DANTE,270,Hey! Where are you going?!
271,VERONICA,271,"Hey listen, jerk! Until today you
never even knew how many guys I'd
slept with, because you never even
asked. And then you act all
nonchalant about fucking twelve
different girls. Well, I never had
sex with twelve different guys!"
272,DANTE,272,"No, but you sucked enough dick!"
273,VERONICA,273,"Yeah, I went down on a few guys..."
274,DANTE,274,A few?
275,VERONICA,275,"...And one of those guys was you!
The last one, I might add, which-if
you're too stupid to comprehend-
means that I've been faithful to
you since we met! All the other
guys I went with before I met you,
so, if you want to have a complex
about it, go ahead! But don't look
at me like I'm the town whore,
because you were plenty busy
yourself, before you met me!"
276,DANTE,276,"Well...why did you have to suck
their dicks? Why didn't you just
sleep with them, like any decent
person?!"
277,VERONICA,277,"Because going down it's a big deal!
I used to like a guy, we'd make
out, and sooner or later I'd go
down on him. But I only had sex
with the guys I loved."
278,DANTE,278,I feel sick.
279,VERONICA,279,I love you. Don't feel sick.
280,DANTE,280,"Every time I kiss you now I'm going
to taste thirty-six other guys."
281,VERONICA,281,"I'm going to school. Maybe later
you'll be a bit more rational."
282,DANTE,282,Thirty-seven. I just can't...
283,VERONICA,283,"Goodbye, Dante."
284,DANTE,284,"Try not to suck any more dicks on
your way through the parking lot!"
285,DANTE,285,"HEY! HEY, YOU! GET BACK HERE!"
286,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,286,"I thought that place was supposed
to be opened at eleven o'clock?
It's twenty after!"
287,DANTE,287,"I called his house twice already.
He should be here soon."
288,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,288,"It's not like it's a demanding job.
I'd like to get paid to sit on my
ass and watch TV. The other day I
walked in there and that sonofabitch
was sleeping."
289,DANTE,289,I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
290,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,290,You calling me a liar?
291,DANTE,291,"No; he was probably just resting
his eyes."
292,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,292,"What the hell is that? Resting his
eyes! It's not like he's some
goddamned air traffic controller!"
293,DANTE,293,"Actually, that's his night job."
294,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,294,"Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack
wise. That's why you're jockeying a
register in some fucking local
convenience store instead of doing
an honest day's work."
295,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,295,"I got no more time to bullshit
around waiting for that sonofabitch.
You make sure this gets back. The
number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And
I wanted to get a damn movie, too."
296,DANTE,296,"If you'll just tell me the title of
your rental choice, I'll have him
hold it for you."
297,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,297,"Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to
Big Choice Video instead."
298,DANTE,298,You forgot your keys.
299,V.A. CUSTOMER,299,The guy ain't here yet.
300,RANDAL,300,"You're kidding. It's almost eleven-
thirty!"
301,V.A. CUSTOMER,301,I know. I've been here since eleven.
302,RANDAL,302,"Man! I hate it when I can't rent
videos!"
303,V.A. CUSTOMER,303,"I would've went to Big Choice, but
the tape I want is right there on
the wall."
304,RANDAL,304,Which one?
305,V.A. CUSTOMER,305,Dental School.
306,RANDAL,306,"You came for that too? That's the
movie I came for."
307,V.A. CUSTOMER,307,I have first dibs.
308,RANDAL,308,Says who?
309,V.A. CUSTOMER,309,"Says me. I've been here for half an
hour. I'd call that first dibs."
310,RANDAL,310,"Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm
getting that tape."
311,V.A. CUSTOMER,311,Like hell you are!
312,RANDAL,312,"I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't
get to rent that tape."
313,V.A. CUSTOMER,313,Twenty bucks?
314,RANDAL,314,Twenty bucks.
315,V.A. CUSTOMER,315,"All right, asshole, you're on."
316,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,316,"You see a pair of keys lying around
here somewhere?"
317,DANTE,317,You're late.
318,RANDAL,318,"What the hell are you doing here? I
thought you were playing hockey at
one."
319,DANTE,319,The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
320,RANDAL,320,Why are the shutters closed?
321,DANTE,321,Someone jammed gum in the locks.
322,RANDAL,322,Bunch of savages in this town.
323,DANTE,323,That's what I said.
324,RANDAL,324,"Shit, if I'd known you were working,
I would've come even later."
325,RANDAL,325,What time do you have to stay till?
326,DANTE,326,"He assured me that he'd be here by
twelve."
327,RANDAL,327,What smells like shoe polish?
328,DANTE,328,Go open the sore.
329,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,329,"Hey-did you see a set of keys lying
around here?"
330,RANDAL,330,"No time for love, Doctor Jones!"
331,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,331,Fucking kids.
332,RANDAL,332,"Some guy just came in refusing to
pay late fees. He said the store
was closed for two hours yesterday.
I tore up his membership."
333,DANTE,333,Shocking abuse of authority.
334,RANDAL,334,"I'm a firm believer in the
philosophy of a ruling class,
especially since I rule."
335,RANDAL,335,Is the Pelican flying?
336,DANTE,336,"Don't screw with it. It makes us
look suspicious."
337,RANDAL,337,I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
338,RANDAL,338,Want something to drink? I'm buying.
339,DANTE (O.C.),339,"No, thanks."
340,RANDAL,340,"Who was on your phone this morning
at about two-thirty? I was trying
to call for a half an hour."
341,DANTE (O.C.),341,Why?
342,RANDAL,342,I wanted to use your car.
343,RANDAL,343,Snake cake?
344,DANTE,344,You don't want to know.
345,RANDAL,345,You called Caitlin again?
346,DANTE,346,She called me.
347,RANDAL,347,Did you tell Veronica?
348,DANTE,348,"One fight a day with Veronica is
about all I can stomach, thanks."
349,RANDAL,349,What do you two fight about?
350,DANTE,350,"I guess it's not really fighting.
She just wants me to leave here, go
back to school, get some direction."
351,RANDAL,351,"I'll bet the most frequent topic of
arguments is Caitlin Bree."
352,DANTE,352,You win.
353,RANDAL,353,"I'm going to offer you some advice,
my friend: let the past be the past.
Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been
with Veronica for how long now?"
354,DANTE,354,Seven months.
355,RANDAL,355,"Chick's nuts about you. How long
did you date Caitlin?"
356,DANTE,356,Five years.
357,RANDAL,357,"Chick only made you nuts. She
cheated on you how many times?"
358,DANTE,358,Eight and a half.
359,RANDAL,359,Eight and a half?
360,DANTE,360,"Party at John K's-senior year. I
get blitzed and pass out in his
bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives
all over me."
361,RANDAL,361,That's cheating?
362,DANTE,362,"In the middle of it, she calls me
Brad."
363,RANDAL,363,She called you Brad?
364,DANTE,364,She called me Brad.
365,RANDAL,365,"That's not cheating. People say
crazy shit during sex. One time, I
called this girl ""Mom."""
366,DANTE,366,"I hit the lights and she freaks.
Turns out she thought I was Brad
Michaelson."
367,RANDAL,367,What do you mean?
368,DANTE,368,"She was supposed to meet Brad
Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked
the wrong one. She had no idea I
was even at the party."
369,RANDAL,369,"Oh, my God."
370,DANTE,370,"Great story, isn't it?"
371,RANDAL,371,That girl was vile to you.
372,DANTE,372,"Interesting postscript to that
story: Do you know who wound up
going with Brad Michaelson in the
other dark bedroom?"
373,RANDAL,373,Your mother.
374,DANTE,374,Allan Harris.
375,RANDAL,375,Chess team Allan Harris?!
376,DANTE,376,"The two moved to Idaho together
after graduation. They raise sheep."
377,RANDAL,377,That's frightening.
378,DANTE,378,"It takes different strokes to move
the world."
379,RANDAL,379,"In light of this lurid tale, I
don't see how you could even
romanticize your relationship with
Caitlin-she broke your heart and
inadvertently drove men to deviant
lifestyles."
380,DANTE,380,"Because there was a lot of good in
our relationship."
381,RANDAL,381,Oh yeah.
382,DANTE,382,"I'm serious. Aside from the
cheating, we were a great couple.
That's what high school's all
about-algebra, bad lunch, and
infidelity."
383,RANDAL,383,"You think things would be any
different now?"
384,DANTE,384,"They are. When she calls me now,
she's a different person-she's
frightened and vulnerable. She's
about to finish college and enter
the real world. That's got to be
scary for anyone."
385,RANDAL,385,"Oh shit, I've got to place an order."
386,DANTE,386,I'm talking to myself here.
387,RANDAL,387,"No, no, I'm listening. She's
leaving college, and...?"
388,DANTE,388,"...and she's looking to me for
support. And I think that this is
leading our relationship to a new
level."
389,RANDAL,389,What about Veronica?
390,DANTE,390,"I think the arguments Veronica and
I are having are some kind of
manifestation of a subconscious
desire to break away from her so
that I can pursue the possibility
of a more meaningful relationship
with Caitlin."
391,RANDAL,391,Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
392,DANTE,392,I think it's safe to say yes.
393,RANDAL,393,"Then I think all four of you had
better sit down and talk it over."
394,DANTE,394,All four?
395,RANDAL,395,"You, Veronica, Caitlin..."
396,RANDAL,396,...and Caitlin's fiancé.
397,RANDAL,397,"Yes, I'd like to place an order,
please...Thank you."
398,MOTHER,398,"Excuse me, but do you see videotapes?"
399,RANDAL,399,What were you looking for?
400,MOTHER,400,"It's called Happy Scrappy-The Hero
Pup."
401,SMALL CHILD,401,Happy Scrappy!
402,RANDAL,402,"I'm on the phone with the
distribution house now. Let me make
sure they have it. What's it called
again?"
403,MOTHER,403,Happy Scrappy-The Hero Pup.
404,SMALL CHILD,404,Happy Scrappy!
405,MOTHER,405,She loves the tape.
406,RANDAL,406,Obviously.
407,RANDAL,407,"Yes, hello; this is R.S.T. Video
calling. Customer number four-
three-five-zero-two-nine. I'd like
to place an order...Okay..."
408,RANDAL (CONT'D),408,"I need one each of the following
tapes: Whisper in the Wind, To Each
His Own, Put it Where It Doesn't
Belong, My Pipes Need Cleaning, All
Tit-Fucking, Volume Eight, I Need
Your Cock, Ass-Worshipping Rim-

Oh, and..."
409,RANDAL (CONT'D),409,What was the name of that movie?
410,MOTHER,410,Happy Scrappy-The Hero Pup.
411,RANDAL,411,"And a copy of Happy Scrappy-The
Hero Pup...Okay, thanks."
412,RANDAL,412,"Sixteen forty-nine. It'll be here
Monday."
413,SMALL CHILD,413,Cunt!
414,DANTE,414,"Yes, I'd like to check on a misprint
in today's edition...Today's
edition...It says ""Bree to Wed
Asian Design Major...No, no;
everything's spelled fine. I just
wanted to know if the piece was a
misprint...I don't know, like a
typographical error or something..."
415,DANTE (O.C.),415,"Maybe it's supposed to be Caitlin
Bray, or Caitlin Bre, with one
e...I'm a curious party...A curious
party..."
416,DANTE,416,"...I'm an ex-boyfriend...Well, it's
just that we talk all the time, and
she never mentioned this engagement,
which is why I'm thinking maybe
it's a misprint..."
417,DANTE (O.C.),417,"...Are you sure?...Maybe there's
like a vindictive printer working
for you..."
418,DANTE,418,"Meaning like someone who maybe-I
don't know-asked her out once and
got shot down, and his revenge is
throwing this bogus article in when
the paper went to
press...Hello?...Hello?"
419,JAY,419,"""Not in me."" That's what she says.
I gotta pull out and spank it to
get it on. So I blow a nut on her
belly, and I get out of there, just
as my uncle walks in. It was such a
close call. I tell you what,
though, I don't care if she is my
cousin, I'm gonna knock those boots
again tonight."
420,JAY,420,"Oh shit, look who it is. The human
vacuum."
421,GIRL 1,421,Scumbag. What are you doing?
422,JAY,422,"Nothing. Just hanging out with
Silent Bob and his cousin."
423,GIRL 1,423,He's your cousin?
424,JAY,424,"Check this out, he's from Russia."
425,GIRL 1,425,No way.
426,JAY,426,"I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I
lying?"
427,JAY,427,"See? And Silent Bob never told a
lie in his life."
428,GIRL 2,428,What part of Russia?
429,JAY,429,"I don't fucking know. What am I,
his biographer?"
430,JAY,430,"Olaf, what part of Russia are you
from?"
431,SILENT BOB,431,Home.
432,OLAF,432,Moscow.
433,GIRL 1,433,He only speaks Russian?
434,JAY,434,"He knows some English, but he can't
not speak it good like we do."
435,GIRL 2,435,Is he staying here?
436,JAY,436,"He's moving to the big city next
week. He wants to be a metal singer."
437,GIRL 1,437,No way!
438,JAY,438,Swear.
439,JAY,439,"Olaf, metal!"
440,JAY,440,That's his fucking metal face.
441,JAY,441,"Olaf, girls nice?"
442,OLAF,442,Skrelnick.
443,JAY,443,That's fucked up.
444,GIRL 1,444,What did he say?
445,JAY,445,"I don't know, man. He's a fucking
character."
446,GIRL 2,446,He really wants to play metal?
447,JAY,447,"He's got his own band in Moscow.
It's called ""Fuck Your Yankee Blue
Jeans"" or something like that."
448,GIRL 1,448,That doesn't sound metal.
449,JAY,449,You gotta hear him sing.
450,JAY,450,"Olaf, ""Berserker!"""
451,JAY,451,"Come on, man, ""Berserker!"""
452,GIRL 2,452,Does he sing in English or Russian?
453,JAY,453,English.
454,JAY,454,"Come on, ""Berserker!"" Girls think
sexy."
455,OLAF,455,Da. Da.
456,JAY,456,"He's gonna sing it. This is too
funny."
457,OLAF,457,"MY LOVE FOR YOU IS LIKE A TRUCK
BERSERKER! WOULD YOU LIKE SOME
MAKING FUCK? BERSERKER!"
458,JAY,458,"That's fucking funny, man!"
459,GIRL 1,459,"Did he say ""making fuck?"""
460,JAY,460,"Wait, there's more."
461,JAY,461,Olaf: sing...
462,OLAF,462,"MY LOVE FOR YOU IS LIKE A ROCK
BERSERKER!WOULD YOU LIKE TO SMOKE
SOME POT? BERSERKER!"
463,OLAF,463,"MY LOVE FOR YOU IS TICKING CLOCK
BERSERKER!WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUCK MY
COCK? BERSERKER!"
464,DANTE,464,You hold the counter and I'll pull.
465,MAN,465,"Usually I just turn the can upside
down."
466,DANTE,466,"Maybe we should soap your hand or
something."
467,MAN,467,"They oughta put some kind of
warning on these cans, like they do
with cigarettes."
468,DANTE,468,I think it's coming now...
469,MAN,469,"Thanks. I thought I was gonna have
to go to the hospital."
470,DANTE,470,"I'll throw this out. Precautionary
measure."
471,MAN,471,It stings a little.
472,DANTE,472,"A word of advice: Sometimes it's
best to let those hard to reach
chips go."
473,MAN,473,Thanks.
474,DANTE,474,"Do you know that article is accurate?
Caitlin's really getting married!"
475,RANDAL,475,You know what I just watched?
476,DANTE,476,"Me pulling a can off some moron's
fist."
477,RANDAL,477,Return of the Jedi.
478,DANTE,478,"Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really
is getting married."
479,RANDAL,479,"Which did you like better: Jedi or
The Empire Strikes Back."
480,DANTE,480,Empire.
481,RANDAL,481,Blasphemy.
482,DANTE,482,"Empire had the better ending: Luke
gets his hand cut off, and finds
out Vader's his father; Han gets
frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.
It ends on such a down note. And
that's life-a series of down
endings. All Jedi had was a bunch
of Muppets."
483,RANDAL,483,"There was something else going on
in Jedi. I never noticed it until
today."
484,DANTE,484,What's that?
485,RANDAL,485,"All right, Vader's boss..."
486,DANTE,486,The Emperor.
487,RANDAL,487,"Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor
is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?"
488,DANTE,488,How do you mean?
489,RANDAL,489,"Well, he's like the pope for the
dark side of the Force. He's a holy
man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an
evil one."
490,DANTE,490,I guess.
491,RANDAL,491,"Now, he's in charge of the Empire.
The Imperial government is under
his control. And the entire galaxy
is under Imperial rule."
492,DANTE,492,Yeah.
493,RANDAL,493,"Then wouldn't that logically mean
that it's a theocracy? If the head
of the Empire is a priest of some
sort, then it stands to reason that
the government is therefore one
based on religion."
494,DANTE,494,"It would stand to reason, yes."
495,RANDAL,495,"Hence, the Empire was a fascist
theocracy, and the rebel forces
were therefore battling religious
persecution."
496,DANTE,496,More or less.
497,RANDAL,497,"The only problem is that at no
point in the series did I ever hear
Leia or any of the rebels declare a
particular religious belief."
498,DANTE,498,I think they were Catholics.
499,BLUE-COLLAR MAN,499,Are you open?
500,DANTE,500,Yeah. Come in.
501,RANDAL,501,You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
502,DANTE,502,There's more?
503,RANDAL,503,"So they build another Death Star,
right?"
504,DANTE,504,Yeah.
505,RANDAL,505,"Now the first one they built was
completed and fully operational
before the Rebels destroyed it."
506,DANTE,506,"Luke blew it up. Give credit where
it's due."
507,RANDAL,507,"And the second one was still being
built when they blew it up."
508,DANTE,508,Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
509,RANDAL,509,"Something just never sat right with
me the second time they destroyed
it. I could never put my finger on
it-something just wasn't right."
510,DANTE,510,And you figured it out?
511,RANDAL,511,"Well, the thing is, the first Death
Star was manned by the Imperial
army-storm troopers, dignitaries-
the only people onboard were
Imperials."
512,DANTE,512,Basically.
513,RANDAL,513,"So when they blew it up, no prob.
Evil is punished."
514,DANTE,514,And the second time around...?
515,RANDAL,515,"The second time around, it wasn't
even finished yet. They were still
under construction."
516,DANTE,516,So?
517,RANDAL,517,"A construction job of that magnitude
would require a helluva lot more
manpower than the Imperial army had
to offer. I'll bet there were
independent contractors working on
that thing: plumbers, aluminum
siders, roofers."
518,DANTE,518,"Not just Imperials, is what you're
getting at."
519,RANDAL,519,"Exactly. In order to get it built
quickly and quietly they'd hire
anybody who could do the job. Do
you think the average storm trooper
knows how to install a toilet main?
All they know is killing and white
uniforms."
520,DANTE,520,"All right, so even if independent
contractors are working on the
Death Star, why are you uneasy with
its destruction?"
521,RANDAL,521,"All those innocent contractors
hired to do a job were killed-
casualties of a war they had
nothing to do with."
522,RANDAL,522,"All right, look-you're a roofer,
and some juicy government contract
comes your way; you got the wife
and kids and the two-story in
suburbia-this is a government
contract, which means all sorts of
benefits. All of a sudden these
left-wing militants blast you with
lasers and wipe out everyone within
a three-mile radius."
523,RANDAL (CONT'D),523,"You didn't ask for that. You have
no personal politics. You're just
trying to scrape out a living."
524,BLUE-COLLAR MAN,524,"Excuse me. I don't mean to
interrupt, but what were you
talking about?"
525,RANDAL,525,The ending of Return of the Jedi.
526,DANTE,526,"My friend is trying to convince me
that any contractors working on the
uncompleted Death Star were innocent
victims when the space station was
destroyed by the rebels."
527,BLUE-COLLAR MAN,527,"Well, I'm a contractor myself. I'm
a roofer..."
528,BLUE-COLLAR MAN,528,"Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements.
And speaking as a roofer, I can say
that a roofer's personal politics
come heavily into play when choosing
jobs."
529,RANDAL,529,Like when?
530,BLUE-COLLAR MAN,530,"Three months ago I was offered a
job up in the hills. A beautiful
house with tons of property. It was
a simple reshingling job, but I was
told that if it was finished within
a day, my price would be doubled.
Then I realized whose house it was."
531,DANTE,531,Whose house was it?
532,BLUE-COLLAR MAN,532,Dominick Bambino's.
533,RANDAL,533,"""Babyface"" Bambino? The gangster?"
534,BLUE-COLLAR MAN,534,"The same. The money was right, but
the risk was too big. I knew who he
was, and based on that, I passed
the job on to a friend of mine."
535,DANTE,535,Based on personal politics.
536,BLUE-COLLAR MAN,536,"Right. And that week, the Foresci
family put a hit on Babyface's
house. My friend was shot and
killed. He wasn't even finished
shingling."
537,RANDAL,537,No way!
538,BLUE-COLLAR MAN,538,"I'm alive because I knew there were
risks involved taking on that
particular client. My friend wasn't
so lucky."
539,BLUE-COLLAR MAN,539,"You know, any contractor willing to
work on that Death Star knew the
risks. If they were killed, it was
their own fault. A roofer listens
to this..."
540,BLUE-COLLAR MAN,540,not his wallet.
541,WOMAN,541,Is that video store open or not?
542,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,542,"They say so much, but they never
tell you if it's any good."
543,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,543,Are either of these any good?
544,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,544,Sir!
545,RANDAL,545,What.
546,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,546,Are either of these any good?
547,RANDAL,547,I don't watch movies.
548,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,548,"Well, have you heard anything about
either of them?"
549,RANDAL,549,No.
550,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,550,"You've never heard anybody say
anything about either movie?"
551,RANDAL (O.C.),551,"I find it's best to stay out of
other people's affairs."
552,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,552,"Well, how about these two movies?"
553,RANDAL,553,They suck.
554,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,554,"I just held up the same two movies.
You're not even paying attention."
555,RANDAL,555,"No, I wasn't."
556,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,556,"I don't think your manager would
appreciate..."
557,RANDAL,557,"I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am."
558,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,558,I beg your pardon!
559,RANDAL,559,"Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to
trick me."
560,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,560,"I only pointed out that you weren't
paying any attention to what I was
saying."
561,RANDAL,561,I hope it feels good.
562,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,562,You hope what feels good?
563,RANDAL,563,"I hope it feels so good to be right.
There is nothing more exhilarating
than pointing out the shortcomings
of others, is there?"
564,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,564,"Well this is the last time I ever
rent here..."
565,RANDAL,565,You'll be missed.
566,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,566,Screw you!
567,RANDAL,567,"You're not allowed to rent here
anymore!"
568,RANDAL,568,Screw me!
569,RANDAL,569,"You'll never believe what this
unruly customer just said..."
570,DANTE,570,Wait.
571,RANDAL,571,She's in here?
572,DANTE,572,"This guy is going through all of
the eggs. Look."
573,DANTE (O.C.),573,"This has been going on for twenty
minutes."
574,RANDAL,574,What's he looking for?
575,DANTE,575,"He said he has to find a perfect
dozen."
576,RANDAL,576,Perfect dozen.
577,DANTE,577,Each egg has to be perfect.
578,RANDAL,578,The quest isn't going well?
579,DANTE,579,"Obviously not. Look at all the
cartons that didn't make the grade."
580,RANDAL (O.C.),580,Why doesn't he just mix and match?
581,DANTE,581,I told him that and he yelled at me.
582,RANDAL,582,What did he say?
583,DANTE,583,"He said it was important to have
standards. He said nobody has pride
anymore."
584,RANDAL,584,"It's not like you laid the eggs
yourself."
585,DANTE,585,"I'll give him five more minutes
then I'm calling the cops. I don't
need this, man. I'm not even
supposed to be here today."
586,SMOKER,586,Two packs of cigarettes.
587,RANDAL,587,I'm as puzzled as you.
588,SMOKER,588,I've actually seen it before.
589,DANTE,589,You know him?
590,SMOKER,590,"No, I've seen that behavior before.
Looking for the perfect carton of
eggs, right?"
591,RANDAL,591,Yeah. How'd you know?
592,SMOKER,592,"I'll bet you a million bucks that
the guy's a guidance counselor."
593,DANTE,593,Why do you say that?
594,SMOKER,594,"I was in the Food City last year
when the same thing happened,
different guy though. Stock boy
told me that the guy had been
looking through the eggs for like
half an hour, doing all sorts of
endurance tests and shit. I ask the
kid how come nobody called the
manager, and he says it happens
twice a week, sometimes more."
595,RANDAL,595,Get out of here.
596,SMOKER,596,"I kid you not. They call it Shell
Shock. Only happens with guidance
counselors for some reason. The kid
said they used to make a big deal
about it, but there's no point."
597,SMOKER (O.C.),597,"He said they always pay for whatever
they break and they never bother
anybody."
598,DANTE,598,Why guidance counselors?
599,SMOKER,599,"If your job served as little
purpose as theirs, wouldn't you
lose it, too?"
600,RANDAL,600,"Come to think of it, my guidance
counselor was kind of worthless."
601,SMOKER,601,"See? It's important to have a job
that makes a difference, boys.
That's why I kill Chinamen for the
railroad."
602,LITTLE GIRL,602,Can I have a pack of cigarettes?
603,DANTE,603,"Did you ever notice all the prices
end in nine? Damn, that's eerie."
604,RANDAL,604,"You know how much money the average
jizz-mopper make per hour?"
605,DANTE,605,What's a jizz-mopper?
606,RANDAL,606,"He's the guy in those nudie-booth
joints who cleans up after each guy
that jerks off."
607,DANTE,607,Nudie booth?
608,RANDAL,608,"Nudie booth. You've never been in a
nudie booth?"
609,DANTE,609,I guess not.
610,RANDAL,610,"Oh, it's great. You step into this
little booth and there's this
window between you and this naked
woman, and she puts on this little
show for like ten bucks."
611,DANTE,611,What kind of show?
612,RANDAL,612,"Think of the weirdest, craziest
shit you'd like to see chicks do.
These chicks do it all. They insert
things into any opening in their
body...any opening."
613,RANDAL,613,He's led a very sheltered life.
614,DANTE,614,Can we talk about this later?
615,RANDAL,615,"The jizz-mopper's job is to clean
up the booths afterward, because
practically everybody shoots a load
against the window, and I don't
know if you know or not, but cum
leaves streaks if you don't clean
it right away."
616,CUSTOMER,616,"This is the last time I come to
this place."
617,DANTE,617,Excuse me?
618,CUSTOMER,618,"Using filthy language in front of
the customers...you should both get
fired."
619,DANTE,619,"We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little
carried away."
620,CUSTOMER,620,"Well, I don't know if sorry can
make up for it. I found your
remarks highly offensive."
621,RANDAL,621,"Well, you think that's offensive..."
622,RANDAL,622,"...then check this out. I think you
can see her kidneys."
623,DANTE,623,"Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry! Please,
wait a second, ma'am..."
624,DANTE,624,"Why do you do things like that? You
know she's going to come back and
tell the boss."
625,RANDAL,625,"Who cares? That lady's an asshole.
Everybody that comes in here is way
too uptight. This job would be
great if it wasn't for the fucking
customers."
626,DANTE,626,I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
627,RANDAL,627,"You gotta loosen up, my friend.
You'd feel a hell of a lot better
if you'd rip into the occasional
customer."
628,DANTE,628,"What for? They don't bother me if I
don't bother them."
629,RANDAL,629,"Liar! Tell me there aren't customers
that annoy the piss out of you on a
daily basis."
630,DANTE,630,There aren't.
631,RANDAL,631,"How can you lie like that? Why
don't you vent? Vent your
frustration. Come on, who pisses
you off?"
632,DANTE,632,"It's not really anyone per se, it's
more of separate groupings."
633,RANDAL,633,Let's hear it.
634,DANTE,634,The milkmaids.
635,RANDAL,635,The milkmaids?
636,DANTE (O.C.),636,"The women that go through every
gallon of milk looking for a later
date. As if somewhere-beyond all
the other gallons-is a container of
milk that won't go bad for like a
decade."
637,RANDAL,637,"You know who I can do without? I
could do without the people in the
video store."
638,DANTE,638,Which ones?
639,RANDAL,639,All of them.
640,FIRST,640,"What would you get for a six-year-
old boy who chronically wets his bed?"
641,SECOND,641,Do you have any new movies in?
642,THIRD,642,"Do you have that one with the guy
who was in that movie that was out
last year?"
643,RANDAL,643,"And they never rent quality flicks;
they always pick the most
intellectually devoid movie on the
rack."
644,FIRST,644,Ooooh! Home Alone!
645,SECOND,645,Ooooh! Hook!
646,THIRD,646,Ooooh! Navy Seals!
647,FIRST,647,"What do you mean there's no ice?
You mean I've gotta drink this
coffee hot?!"
648,SECOND,648,How much?
649,THIRD,649,Do you sell hubcaps?
650,RANDAL,650,"See? You vented. Don't you feel
better now?"
651,DANTE,651,No.
652,RANDAL,652,Why not?
653,DANTE,653,"Because my ex-girlfriend is getting
married."
654,RANDAL,654,"Jesus, you got a one-track mind.
It's always Caitlin, Caitlin,
Caitlin..."
655,DANTE,655,Veronica!
656,VERONICA,656,What happened to home by twelve?
657,DANTE,657,"He still hasn't shown up. Why
aren't you in class?"
658,VERONICA,658,"Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped
home and brought you some lunch."
659,DANTE,659,What is it?
660,VERONICA,660,"Peanut butter and jelly with the
crusts cut off. What do you think
it is? It's lasagne."
661,DANTE,661,Really?
662,DANTE,662,You're the best.
663,VERONICA,663,I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.
664,VERONICA,664,"Hi, Randal."
665,RANDAL (O.C.),665,Thirty-seven!
666,DANTE,666,Shut up!
667,DANTE,667,"Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still
not happy about it, but I've been
able to deal."
668,DANTE,668,"Why don't you go back to the video
store?"
669,VERONICA,669,You had to tell him.
670,DANTE,670,"I had to tell someone. He put it
into perspective."
671,VERONICA,671,What did he say?
672,DANTE,672,At least he wasn't thirty-six.
673,VERONICA,673,And that made you feel better?
674,DANTE,674,"And he said most of them are
college guys, I've never met or seen."
675,VERONICA,675,"The ostrich syndrome: if you don't
see it..."
676,DANTE,676,...it isn't there. Yes.
677,VERONICA,677,Thank you for being rational.
678,DANTE,678,Thank you for the lasagne.
679,VERONICA,679,You couldn't get these shutters open?
680,DANTE,680,"I called a locksmith and he said
the earliest he could get here it
tomorrow."
681,VERONICA,681,"Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back
for the one-thirty class."
682,DANTE,682,What time do you get finished?
683,VERONICA,683,"Eight. But I have a sorority
meeting till nine, so I'll be back
before you close. Can we go out and
get some coffee?"
684,DANTE,684,Sure.
685,VERONICA,685,Good.
686,VERONICA,686,"I'll see you when you close, then.
Enjoy the lasagne."
687,RANDAL,687,"All right, now if you're really
feeling dangerous tonight, then
Smokey and the Bandit Three is the
movie you must rent."
688,CUSTOMER,688,"This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds
in it."
689,RANDAL,689,"Hey, neither did ET; but that was a
great movie, right?"
690,DANTE,690,"Can you come next door? I gotta
make a phone call."
691,RANDAL,691,"Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?"
692,DANTE,692,The best Burtless movie ever made.
693,CUSTOMER,693,"Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?"
694,RANDAL,694,Lenin's Tomb.
695,DANTE,695,"Hello, is Mr. Synder there? This is
Dante...Did he say if he was on his
way here?...Here...The convenience
store...I know, but the other guy
called out this morning and Mr."
696,DANTE (CONT'D),696,"Synder asked me to cover until he
got here. He said he'd be here by
noon, but it's one-thirty now, so
I...Excuse me...Vermont?!...No,
that can't be; I talked to him this
morning...He left at what time?...He
really went to Vermont?...When the
hell was someone going to tell
me?...He promised he was coming by
noon!...Jesus...When does he get
back?!...TUESDAY!...You've gotta be
fucking kidding me!...I've got a
hockey game at two, and the fucking
shutters are jammed closed, and
he's in Vermont?...I'm not even
supposed to be here today!!"
697,DANTE (CONT'D),697,"So I'm stuck here till
closing?...This is just great...I
just can't believe...I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to yell at
you...No...No, I'll be all
right...Well, that's all I can do,
right?...Thanks."
698,RANDAL,698,Vermont?
699,DANTE,699,Can you believe this?!
700,RANDAL,700,"He didn't mention it when he called
you this morning?"
701,DANTE,701,Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
702,RANDAL,702,"So, what-you're stuck here all day?"
703,DANTE,703,FUCK!
704,RANDAL,704,Why'd you apologize?
705,DANTE,705,What?
706,RANDAL,706,"I heard you apologize. Why? You
have every right in the world to be
mad."
707,DANTE,707,I know.
708,RANDAL,708,"That seems to be the leitmotif in
your life; ever backing down."
709,DANTE,709,I don't back down.
710,RANDAL,710,"Yes, you do. You always back down.
You assume blame that isn't yours,
you come in when called as opposed
to enjoying your day off, you
buckle like a belt."
711,DANTE,711,You know what pisses me off the most?
712,RANDAL,712,"The fact that I'm right about your
buckling?"
713,DANTE,713,I'm going to miss the game.
714,RANDAL,714,Because you buckled.
715,DANTE,715,"Would you shut the hell up with
that shit? It's not helping."
716,RANDAL,716,"Don't yell at me, pal."
717,DANTE,717,Sorry.
718,RANDAL,718,See? There you go again.
719,DANTE,719,"I can't believe I'm going to miss
the game!"
720,RANDAL,720,At least we're stuck here together.
721,DANTE,721,You've got a customer.
722,RANDAL (O.C.),722,What? What do you want?!
723,DANTE,723,"Sanford? Dante...I can't play
today...I'm stuck at work...I know
I'm not scheduled, but-just forget
it. I can't play...Neither can
Randal...He's working too..."
724,DANTE,724,"Wait a second. Do we have to play
at the park?...Hold on..."
725,DANTE,725,Do you feel limber?
726,DANTE,726,Pull my laces tighter.
727,RANDAL,727,"I've gotta tell you, my friend:
this is one of the ballsiest moves
I've ever been privy to. I never
would have thought you capable of
such blatant disregard of store
policy."
728,DANTE,728,"I told him I had a game today. It's
his own fault."
729,RANDAL,729,"No argument here. Insubordination
rules."
730,DANTE,730,"I just want to play hockey like I
was scheduled to."
731,SANFORD,731,"Dante, let me grab a Gatorade."
732,DANTE,732,"If you grab a Gatorade, then
everybody's going to grab one."
733,SANFORD,733,So?
734,DANTE,734,"So? So nobody's going to want to
pay for these Gatorades."
735,SANFORD,735,"What do you care? Hey, what smells
like shoe polish?"
736,DANTE,736,"I've got a responsibility here. I
can't let everybody grab free drinks."
737,SANFORD,737,"What responsibility? You're closing
the fucking store to play hockey."
738,RANDAL,738,"He's blunt, but he's got a point."
739,DANTE,739,"At least let me maintain some
semblance of managerial control here."
740,SANFORD,740,"All I'm saying is if you're going
to be insubordinate, you should go
the full nine and not pussy out
when it comes to free refreshments."
741,RANDAL,741,"He's right. As if we're suddenly
gonna have a run on Gatorade."
742,SANFORD,742,Fuckin-A.
743,DANTE,743,"All right. Jesus, you fuckers are
pushy."
744,SANFORD,744,"Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying
an Asian drum major."
745,RANDAL,745,Design major.
746,DANTE,746,Can we not talk about this?
747,SANFORD,747,"Fine by me. But you're living in
denial and suppressing rage."
748,SANFORD,748,"Dante said we can all drink free
Gatorade."
749,RANDAL,749,Are you gonna lock the store?
750,DANTE,750,"I don't know. You going to lock the
video store?"
751,RANDAL,751,"Look who you're asking here. How're
we gonna block off the street?"
752,DANTE,752,We're not playing in the street.
753,RANDAL,753,Then where're we gonna play?
754,DANTE,754,Ready?
755,CUSTOMER,755,When's this period over?
756,SOMEONE (O.C.),756,Eight more minutes!
757,CUSTOMER,757,"Are you shitting me? I want to get
cigarettes!"
758,DANTE,758,"If you can just wait a few more
minutes."
759,CUSTOMER,759,"Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy
neck on this ladder!"
760,SOMEONE (O.C.),760,Dante! Where are you?!
761,CUSTOMER,761,He's busy!
762,DANTE,762,I'll be right back. It's almost over.
763,CUSTOMER,763,"What the fuck is this?! I want some
service!"
764,DANTE (O.C.),764,In a second!
765,CUSTOMER,765,"Fuck in a second! This is...Look at
you! You can't even pass!"
766,DANTE (O.C.),766,I can pass!
767,CUSTOMER,767,How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
768,DANTE,768,Who are you to make assessments?
769,CUSTOMER,769,I'll assess all I want!
770,SOMEONE (O.C.),770,DANTE! ARE YOU IN OR OUT!
771,CUSTOMER,771,Don't pass to this guy! He sucks!
772,CUSTOMER,772,You suck!
773,DANTE,773,Like you're better!
774,CUSTOMER,774,I can whip your ass.
775,DANTE (O.C.),775,That's easy to say from over here.
776,CUSTOMER (O.C.),776,"Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll
knock your fucking teeth out and
pass all over your ass."
777,WOMAN,777,Is the convenience store open?
778,DANTE AND CUSTOMER,778,NO!
779,DANTE,779,"There's a stick over there. You're
shooting against the goal."
780,DANTE,780,"REDDING! COME OFF AND LET THIS FUCK
ON!"
781,DANTE,781,Give me another ball.
782,SOMEONE (O.C.),782,There are no more.
783,DANTE,783,"What the fuck are you talking about?
How many balls did you bring?"
784,SANFORD,784,"There was the orange ball...and the
orange ball."
785,DANTE,785,Are there any balls down there?!
786,JAY (O.C.),786,"'Bout the biggest pair you ever
seen! NYNNE!!"
787,DANTE,787,You only brought one ball?!
788,SANFORD,788,"I thought Redding had like three
balls!"
789,REDDING (O.C.),789,I thought Dante had the balls.
790,DANTE,790,Nobody has another ball?
791,SANFORD,791,Shit!
792,DANTE,792,"We get...what...twelve minutes of
game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!!"
793,DANTE,793,"I'm not even supposed to be here
today!"
794,SANFORD,794,"We still get free Gatorade, right?"
795,OLD MAN,795,Be careful.
796,DANTE,796,I'm trying.
797,OLD MAN,797,"You know the insides of those are
filled with stuff that gives you
cancer."
798,DANTE,798,So I'm told.
799,OLD MAN,799,"I had a friend that used to chew
glass for a living. In the circus."
800,DANTE,800,"And he got cancer by chewing
fluorescent bulb glass...?"
801,OLD MAN,801,"No, he got hit by a bus."
802,DANTE,802,Oh...Can I help you?
803,OLD MAN,803,"Well, that depends. Do you have a
bathroom?"
804,DANTE,804,"Um...yeah, but it's for employees
only."
805,OLD MAN,805,"I understand, but can I use it. I'm
not that young anymore, so I'm kind
of...you know...incontinent."
806,DANTE,806,"Uh...sure. Go ahead. It's back
through the cooler."
807,OLD MAN,807,"Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet
paper you got back there?"
808,DANTE,808,The white kind.
809,OLD MAN,809,"I'm not asking about the color. I
mean is it rough or cottony?"
810,DANTE,810,"Actually, it is kind of rough."
811,OLD MAN,811,"Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell
out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would
you mind if I took a roll of the
soft stuff back there. I see you
sell the soft stuff."
812,DANTE,812,"Yeah, but..."
813,OLD MAN,813,"Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference?
You said yourself the stuff that's
there now is rough."
814,DANTE,814,"Yeah, okay. Go ahead."
815,OLD MAN,815,"Thanks son, you're a lifesaver."
816,OLD MAN,816,"Say, young fella, you know I hate
to bother you again, but can I take
a paper or something back there...to
read? It usually takes me a while,
and I like to read while it's going
on."
817,DANTE,817,Jesus...go ahead.
818,OLD MAN,818,"Thanks, young man. You've got a
heart of gold."
819,DANTE,819,"You know, you probably could've
been home, already, in the time
it's taken you to get in there."
820,OLD MAN,820,"Can I trouble you for one of those
magazines?"
821,DANTE,821,I said go ahead.
822,OLD MAN,822,"No, I mean the ones there. Behind
the counter."
823,DANTE,823,The porno mags?
824,OLD MAN,824,"Yeah. I like the cartoons. They
make me laugh. They draw the
biggest titties."
825,DANTE,825,Here. Now leave me alone.
826,OLD MAN,826,"Uh, can I have the other one. The
one below this one. They show more
in that one."
827,OLD MAN,827,Thanks son. I appreciate this.
828,RANDAL,828,Helluva game!
829,DANTE,829,"One ball!! They come all the way
here...I close the damn store...for
one ball!"
830,RANDAL,830,"Hockey's hockey. At least we got to
play."
831,DANTE,831,"Randal, twelve minutes is not a
game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!"
832,RANDAL,832,"Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want
something to drink?"
833,DANTE,833,Gatorade.
834,RANDAL (O.C.),834,What happened to all the Gatorade?
835,DANTE,835,Exactly. They drank it all.
836,RANDAL (O.C.),836,"After an exhausting game like that
I can believe it."
837,DANTE,837,"""It's not like we're gonna sell
out."""
838,RANDAL,838,You know what Sanford told me?
839,DANTE,839,"I still can't believe Caitlin's
getting married."
840,RANDAL,840,Julie Dwyer died.
841,DANTE,841,"Yeah, right."
842,RANDAL,842,"No, I'm serious."
843,DANTE,843,"Oh, my god."
844,RANDAL,844,"Sanford's brother dates her cousin.
He found out this morning."
845,DANTE,845,How? When?
846,RANDAL,846,Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
847,DANTE,847,Jesus.
848,RANDAL,848,"She was swimming at the YMCA pool
when it happened. Died midbackstroke."
849,DANTE,849,"I haven't seen her in almost two
years."
850,RANDAL,850,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't
she one of the illustrious twelve?"
851,DANTE,851,Number six.
852,RANDAL,852,You've had sex with a dead person.
853,DANTE,853,I'm gonna go to her wake.
854,RANDAL,854,"No, you're not."
855,DANTE,855,Why not?
856,RANDAL,856,It's today.
857,DANTE,857,What!?
858,RANDAL,858,"Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next
show is at four."
859,DANTE,859,Shit. What about tomorrow?
860,RANDAL,860,"One night only. She's buried in the
morning."
861,DANTE,861,"You've gotta watch the store. I
have to go to this."
862,RANDAL,862,"Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred
to you that I might bereaved as well?"
863,DANTE,863,You hardly knew her!
864,RANDAL,864,"True, but do you know how many
people are going to be there? All
of our old classmates, to say the
least."
865,DANTE,865,Stop it. This is beneath even you.
866,RANDAL,866,"I'm not missing what's probably
going to be the social event of the
season."
867,DANTE,867,You hate people.
868,RANDAL,868,"But I love gatherings. Isn't it
ironic?"
869,DANTE,869,"Don't be an asshole. Somebody has
to stay with the store."
870,RANDAL,870,"If you go, I go."
871,DANTE,871,She meant nothing to you!
872,RANDAL,872,"She meant nothing to you either
until I told you she died."
873,DANTE,873,I'm not taking you to this funeral.
874,RANDAL,874,I'm going with you.
875,DANTE,875,I can't close the store.
876,RANDAL,876,"You just closed the store to play
hockey on the roof!"
877,DANTE,877,"Exactly, which means I can't close
it for another hour so we can both
go to a wake."
878,RANDAL,878,You were saying?
879,DANTE,879,"Thanks for putting me in a tough
spot. You're a good friend."
880,RANDAL,880,"She was pretty young, hunhh?"
881,DANTE,881,Twenty-two; same as us.
882,RANDAL,882,An embolism in a pool.
883,DANTE,883,An embarrassing way to die.
884,RANDAL,884,"That's nothing compared to how my
cousin Walter died."
885,DANTE,885,How'd he die?
886,RANDAL,886,Broke his neck.
887,DANTE,887,That's embarrassing?
888,RANDAL,888,"He broke his neck trying to suck
his own dick."
889,DANTE,889,Shut the hell up.
890,RANDAL,890,Bible truth.
891,DANTE,891,Stop it.
892,RANDAL,892,I swear.
893,DANTE,893,"Oh, my god."
894,RANDAL,894,"Come on. Haven't you ever tried to
suck your own dick?"
895,DANTE,895,No!
896,RANDAL,896,Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
897,DANTE,897,"Because I never tried to suck my
own dick?"
898,RANDAL,898,"No, because you won't admit to it.
As if a guy's a fucking pervert
because he tries to go down on
himself. You're as curious as the
rest of us, pal. You've tried it."
899,DANTE,899,Who found him?
900,RANDAL,900,"My cousin? My aunt found him. On
his bed, doubled over himself with
his legs on top. Dick in his mouth.
My aunt freaked out. It was a mess."
901,DANTE,901,His dick was in his mouth?
902,RANDAL,902,Balls resting on his lips.
903,DANTE,903,"He made it, hunhh?"
904,RANDAL,904,"Yeah, but at what a price."
905,DANTE,905,I could never reach.
906,RANDAL,906,Reach what?
907,DANTE,907,You know.
908,RANDAL,908,"What, your dick?"
909,DANTE,909,"Yeah. Like you said, you know. I
guess everyone tries it, sooner of
later."
910,RANDAL,910,I never tried it.
911,RANDAL,911,Fucking pervert.
912,DANTE,912,"I know it was a bad idea to close
the store."
913,RANDAL,913,Listen to you.
914,DANTE,914,"I can't help it. At least when we
were playing hockey outside, I
could see if anyone wanted to go in."
915,RANDAL,915,"Nobody's there. It's four o'clock
on a Saturday. How many people ever
come to the store at four on a
Saturday?"
916,DANTE,916,I can't fucking believe you!!
917,RANDAL,917,"I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!"
918,DANTE,918,"You knocked the fucking casket
over, for Chrissakes!"
919,RANDAL,919,"I was just leaning on it! It was an
accident!"
920,DANTE,920,"Does anyone ever knock over a
casket on purpose?"
921,RANDAL,921,So the casket fell over! Big deal!
922,DANTE,922,Her fucking body fell out!
923,RANDAL,923,"So they'll put her back in! It's
not like it's gonna matter if she
breaks something!"
924,DANTE,924,Just...go! Go open the video store.
925,JAY (O.C.),925,Yeah! Open the video store!!
926,RANDAL,926,"Shut the fuck up, junkie!"
927,DANTE,927,Go open the video store.
928,JAY,928,"Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk."
929,DANTE,929,"How many times I gotta tell you not
to deal outside the store."
930,JAY,930,I'm not dealing.
931,KID,931,"You got anything, man?"
932,JAY,932,"Yeah, what do you want?"
933,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,933,"Hey, did you see a set of keys
lying around here somewhere?"
934,RANDAL,934,Let me borrow your car.
935,DANTE,935,I don't want to talk to you.
936,RANDAL,936,Fine. Just lend me your car.
937,DANTE,937,Why should I loan you my car?
938,RANDAL,938,I want to rent a movie.
939,DANTE,939,You want to rent a movie.
940,RANDAL,940,What's that for?
941,DANTE,941,You work in a video store!
942,RANDAL,942,"I work in a shitty video store. I
want to go to a good video store so
I can rent a good movie."
943,CUSTOMER,943,Are you open?
944,DANTE AND RANDAL,944,YES!
945,CUSTOMER,945,Pack of cigarettes.
946,CUSTOMER,946,Cute cat. What's its name?
947,RANDAL,947,Annoying Customer.
948,DANTE,948,"Can you imagine being halfway
decent to the customers at least
some of the time?"
949,RANDAL,949,Let me borrow your car.
950,DANTE,950,May I be blunt with you?
951,RANDAL,951,If you must.
952,DANTE,952,"We are employees of Quick Stop
Convenience and RST video,
respectively. As such, we have
certain responsibilities which-
though it may seem cruel and
unusual-does include manning our
posts until closing."
953,RANDAL,953,"I see. So playing hockey and
attending wakes-these practices are
standard operating procedure."
954,DANTE,954,"There's a difference. Those were
obligations. Obligations that could
not have been met at any later date.
Now renting videos-that's just
gratuitous, not to mention
illogical, considering you work in
a video store."
955,CUSTOMER,955,Are you open?
956,DANTE,956,Yes.
957,RANDAL,957,"You know what? I don't think I care
for you rationale."
958,DANTE,958,"It's going to have to do for now,
considering that it's my car that's
up for request."
959,DANTE,959,Can I help you?
960,CUSTOMER,960,Pack of cigarettes.
961,RANDAL,961,What's your point?
962,DANTE,962,"My point is that you're a clerk,
paid to do a job. You can't just do
anything you want while you're
working."
963,CUSTOMER,963,"""Space Alien Revealed as Head of
Time Warner; Reports Stock
Increase."""
964,CUSTOMER,964,"They print any kind of shit in
these papers."
965,DANTE,965,They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
966,RANDAL,966,"So your argument is that title
dictates behavior?"
967,DANTE,967,What?
968,RANDAL,968,"The reasons you won't let me borrow
your care is because I have a title
and a job description, and I'm
supposed to follow it, right?"
969,DANTE,969,Exactly.
970,CUSTOMER,970,"I saw one, one time, that said the
world was ending the next week."
971,CUSTOMER (CONT'D),971,"Then in the next week's paper, they
said we were miraculously saved at
the zero hour by a Koala-fish
mutant bird. Crazy shit."
972,RANDAL,972,"So I'm no more responsible for my
own decisions while I'm here at
work than, say, the Death Squad
soldiers in Bosnia?"
973,DANTE,973,"That's stretching it. You're not
being asked to slay children or
anything."
974,RANDAL,974,Not yet.
975,CUSTOMER,975,"And I remember this one time the
damn paper said..."
976,CUSTOMER,976,"I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD!
YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!"
977,DANTE,977,"Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean
it! He was trying to get me."
978,CUSTOMER,978,"Well, he missed!"
979,DANTE,979,"I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund
your cigarette money, and we'll
call it even."
980,CUSTOMER,980,"This is the last time I ever come
here."
981,CUSTOMER,981,"And if I ever see you again, I'm
gonna break your fucking head open!"
982,DANTE,982,What the fuck did you do that for?
983,RANDAL,983,"Two reasons: one, I hate when the
people can't shut up about the
stupid tabloid headlines."
984,DANTE,984,Jesus!
985,RANDAL,985,"And two, to make a point: title
does not dictate behavior."
986,DANTE,986,What?
987,RANDAL,987,"If title dictated my behavior, as a
clerk serving the public, I wouldn't
be allowed to spit a mouthful of
water at that guy. But I did, so my
point is that people dictate their
own behavior. Hence, even though
I'm a clerk in this video store, I
choose to go rent videos at Big
Choice."
988,RANDAL,988,Agreed?
989,DANTE,989,"You're a danger to both the dead
and the living."
990,RANDAL,990,"I like to think I'm a master of my
own destiny."
991,DANTE,991,"Please, get the hell out of here."
992,RANDAL,992,I know I'm your hero.
993,TRAINER,993,"Sounds to me like somebody needs to
hit the gym."
994,DANTE,994,Excuse me?
995,TRAINER,995,"I heard you strain when you put the
milk in the bag. That milk only
weighs about seven pounds."
996,DANTE,996,I didn't strain. I sighed.
997,TRAINER,997,"I don't think so. That was a grunt;
a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid
in the stretching of muscles. I'm a
trainer. I know what that sound
signifies: you're out of shape."
998,DANTE,998,I don't think so.
999,TRAINER,999,"Oh, I do. You made the same noise
when you reached across the counter
for my cash. Your muscles are thin
and sadly underutilized."
1000,DANTE,1000,They are not.
1001,TRAINER,1001,"Yes, they are. You're out of shape."
1002,DANTE,1002,"What are you talking about? There's
no fat on this body."
1003,TRAINER,1003,"No fat, but no tone either. You
don't get enough exercise."
1004,HEATHER,1004,Are you open?
1005,DANTE,1005,Yes.
1006,HEATHER,1006,Just the paper.
1007,DANTE,1007,Thirty-fire.
1008,TRAINER,1008,"Let me ask you a question: Do you
think this guy's out of shape?"
1009,HEATHER,1009,"I don't know. I can't really tell
from here."
1010,TRAINER,1010,He is.
1011,DANTE,1011,I am not.
1012,TRAINER,1012,How much can you bench?
1013,DANTE,1013,I don't know.
1014,HEATHER,1014,"I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops."
1015,DANTE,1015,I know I can bench more than that!
1016,TRAINER,1016,I think the lady called it.
1017,HEATHER,1017,"My ex-boyfriend was about his
height, but he was much bulkier. He
could bench two-fifty, three
hundred easy."
1018,TRAINER,1018,"I do about three-fifty, four."
1019,HEATHER,1019,No way!
1020,TRAINER,1020,Feel that.
1021,HEATHER,1021,That's tight. Solid.
1022,TRAINER,1022,Now feel his.
1023,TRAINER,1023,"Roll up your sleeve, chief."
1024,DANTE,1024,Oh for God's sake!
1025,TRAINER,1025,"See? You're ashamed. You know
you're out of shape. Take my card.
I can help you tone that body up in
no time. Get you on an aerobics and
free-weights program."
1026,SUITED MAN,1026,You open?
1027,DANTE,1027,Yes.
1028,DANTE,1028,I'm not out of shape.
1029,SUITED MAN,1029,"Excuse me, but have you been here
all day?"
1030,DANTE,1030,What?
1031,HEATHER,1031,He's got those love handles.
1032,DANTE,1032,I don't have love handles.
1033,SUITED MAN,1033,"Were you working here at about four
o'clock?"
1034,DANTE,1034,"I've been here since six o'clock
this morning. Why?"
1035,TRAINER,1035,"It's probably from being around all
this food every day."
1036,HEATHER,1036,"Oh, I know. If I had to work here
all day, I'd be bloated and out of
shape, too."
1037,DANTE,1037,I'm not out of shape!
1038,SUITED MAN,1038,Can I have your name please?
1039,DANTE,1039,Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
1040,HEATHER,1040,"You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I
didn't even recognize you!"
1041,TRAINER,1041,Because he's out of shape.
1042,DANTE,1042,Do I know you?
1043,HEATHER,1043,"You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung
out with..."
1044,DANTE,1044,Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
1045,HEATHER,1045,I'm her sister.
1046,DANTE,1046,You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
1047,HEATHER,1047,"Yep. I remember you got caught in
my parents' room with Caitlin once."
1048,TRAINER,1048,Did you say Caitlin Bree?
1049,DANTE,1049,Yeah.
1050,TRAINER,1050,"Pretty girl, about this girl's
height-dark hair-gorgeous body?"
1051,DANTE,1051,Yeah?
1052,TRAINER,1052,"And your name is Dante Hicks? You
went to high school with her? You
played hockey?"
1053,DANTE,1053,How do you know that?
1054,TRAINER,1054,"Oh man! Hey, you still going out
with her?"
1055,DANTE,1055,"No, she's getting married."
1056,TRAINER,1056,To you?
1057,HEATHER,1057,To an Asian design major.
1058,TRAINER,1058,Shit!
1059,TRAINER,1059,"Don't take this the wrong way, but
I used to fuck her."
1060,DANTE,1060,What?
1061,TRAINER,1061,"While you two were dating in high
school. We're talking four, five
years ago, back when I drove a
Trans-Am."
1062,HEATHER,1062,Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
1063,TRAINER,1063,Yeah!
1064,DANTE,1064,You know him?
1065,HEATHER,1065,"Caitlin used to talk about him all
the time."
1066,TRAINER,1066,Really?
1067,HEATHER,1067,"Oh yeah. You were the built older
guy with the black Trans and the
big..."
1068,DANTE,1068,Wait a second!
1069,DANTE,1069,"You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree?
While I was dating her?"
1070,TRAINER,1070,"All the time. That girl was like a
rabbit."
1071,DANTE,1071,I...I don't believe this...
1072,HEATHER,1072,"I still remember Caitlin telling us
about that time you two went to
that motel-the one with the mirrors
and the hot tub in the room."
1073,DANTE,1073,THE GLADES MOTEL?
1074,TRAINER,1074,Holy shit! She told you about that!
1075,TRAINER,1075,"Buddy of mine worked there. Said he
watched the whole thing. They used
to film people at that hotel;
nobody knew about it."
1076,HEATHER,1076,"She said one time you set up a tent
on the beach and you guys did it in
the middle of this big rainstorm."
1077,DANTE,1077,"What? When? When did all this shit
happen?"
1078,TRAINER,1078,"Hey man, that was a long time ago.
Don't let it get to you."
1079,HEATHER,1079,"I'm surprised you never found out
about it, Dante. Everybody in
school knew-even in my class."
1080,DANTE,1080,"Jesus Christ, what next?"
1081,SUITED MAN,1081,Here you go.
1082,DANTE,1082,What's this?
1083,SUITED MAN,1083,"A fine, for five hundred dollars."
1084,DANTE,1084,WHAT?
1085,TRAINER,1085,Five hundred bucks? What for?
1086,SUITED MAN,1086,"For violation of New Jersey Statute
Section Two A, number one-seventy
slash fifty-one: Any person who
sells or makes available tobacco or
tobacco-related products to persons
under the age of eighteen is
regarded as disorderly."
1087,DANTE,1087,What are you talking about?
1088,SUITED MAN,1088,"According to the NJAC-the New
Jersey Administrative Code, section
eighteen, five, slash twelve point
five-a fine of no less than two
hundred and fifty dollars is to be
leveled against any person reported
selling cigarettes to a minor."
1089,DANTE,1089,I didn't do that!
1090,SUITED MAN,1090,You said you were here all day?
1091,DANTE,1091,"Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes
to any kids!"
1092,SUITED MAN,1092,"An angry mother called the state
division of taxation and complained
that the man working at Quick Stop
Convenience sold her five-year-old
daughter cigarettes today at around
four o'clock. Division of taxation
calls the State Board of Health,
and they send me down here to issue
a fine. You say you were working
all day, hence the fine is yours.
It's doubled due to the incredibly
young age of the child."
1093,DANTE,1093,"But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
kid!"
1094,TRAINER,1094,"To a five-year-old kid? What a
scumbag!"
1095,HEATHER,1095,"That's sick, Dante."
1096,DANTE,1096,"I didn't sell cigarettes to any
kids! I swear!"
1097,SUITED MAN,1097,"The due date is on the bottom. This
summons cannot be contested in any
court of law. Failure to remit
before the due date will result in
a charge of criminal negligence,
and a warrant will be issued for
your arrest. Have a nice day."
1098,DANTE,1098,"But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
kids! Hey!"
1099,TRAINER,1099,"Forget it. I don't want to deal
with a guy that sells cigarettes to
a five-year-old."
1100,TRAINER,1100,Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
1101,HEATHER,1101,Sure. How about the beach?
1102,TRAINER,1102,I like the way you think.
1103,DANTE,1103,Jesus! What next?
1104,VOICE (O.C.),1104,Dante?
1105,DANTE,1105,What?
1106,DANTE,1106,Caitlin?
1107,JAY,1107,"That's the price, my brother."
1108,JOHN,1108,"Yo, I don't have that kind of cash."
1109,JAY,1109,"For this kind of hash, you need
that kind of cash."
1110,JOHN,1110,How long you gonna be here?
1111,JAY,1111,"Till ten. Then I'm going to John
K's party."
1112,JOHN,1112,You're gonna be at John K's party?
1113,JAY,1113,My man is deaf.
1114,JAY,1114,I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!
1115,JAY,1115,Neh.
1116,JOHN,1116,"Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm
gonna get the cash and buy it from
you at John K's. You're gonna bring
it, right?"
1117,JAY,1117,"The only place I don't bring my
drugs is church. And that ain't
till Sunday morning."
1118,JOHN,1118,Yo. I'll see you at that party.
1119,JOHN,1119,I'll see you there?
1120,JAY,1120,I'll see you there.
1121,JAY,1121,"It's motherfuckers like that who
give recreational drug users a bag
name."
1122,JAY,1122,"HEY BABY! YOU EVER HAD YOUR ASSHOLE
LICKED?"
1123,DANTE,1123,When did you get back?
1124,CAITLIN,1124,Just now.
1125,DANTE,1125,My God. I haven't seen you since...
1126,CAITLIN,1126,Dante. You've got a customer.
1127,CAITLIN,1127,"I just saw Alyssa's little sister
outside. She was with Rick Derris."
1128,DANTE,1128,"Let's not talk about that. How'd
you get home?"
1129,CAITLIN,1129,Train. It took eight hours.
1130,DANTE,1130,I can't believe you're here.
1131,CUSTOMER,1131,"Excuse me, do you have..."
1132,DANTE,1132,"To the back, above the oil."
1133,DANTE,1133,How long are you staying?
1134,CAITLIN,1134,"Until Monday. Then I have to take
the train back."
1135,CUSTOMER,1135,Pack of cigarettes.
1136,CUSTOMER,1136,"Congratulations. I saw that
announcement in today's paper."
1137,CUSTOMER,1137,She's marrying an Asian design major.
1138,DANTE,1138,So I'm told.
1139,JAY,1139,"Man, it's fucking slow."
1140,CAITLIN,1140,"You're just going to lock the store
like that?"
1141,DANTE,1141,"I want to talk to you about
something, and I don't want to be
disturbed."
1142,CAITLIN,1142,You saw it?
1143,DANTE,1143,"Very dramatic, I thought."
1144,CAITLIN,1144,It's not what you think.
1145,DANTE,1145,"What, it's worse? You're pregnant
with an Asian design major's child?"
1146,CAITLIN,1146,I'm not pregnant.
1147,DANTE,1147,"Were you going to tell me or just
send me an invitation?"
1148,CAITLIN,1148,"I was going to tell you. But then
we were getting along so well, I
didn't want to mess it up."
1149,DANTE,1149,"You could've broke it to me gently,
you know; at least started by
telling me you had a boyfriend. I
told you I have a girlfriend."
1150,CAITLIN,1150,"I know, I'm sorry. But when we
started talking...it's like I
forgot I had a boyfriend. And then
he proposed last month..."
1151,DANTE,1151,And you said yes?
1152,CAITLIN,1152,"Well...kind of, sort of?"
1153,DANTE,1153,"Is that what they teach you at that
school of yours? Kind of, sort of?
Everyone knows about this except me!
Do you know how humiliating that is?"
1154,CAITLIN,1154,"I would've told you, and you would
have stopped calling, like a baby."
1155,DANTE,1155,How do you know that?
1156,CAITLIN,1156,"Because I know you. You prefer
drastic measures to rational ones."
1157,DANTE,1157,So you're really getting married?
1158,CAITLIN,1158,No.
1159,DANTE,1159,"No, you're not really getting
married?"
1160,CAITLIN,1160,"The story goes like this: He
proposed, and I told him I had to
think about it, and he insisted I
wear the ring anyway. Then my
mother told the paper we were
engaged."
1161,DANTE,1161,How like her.
1162,CAITLIN,1162,"Then my mother called me this
morning and told me the announcement
was in the paper. That's when I
hopped the train to come back here,
because I knew you'd be a wreck."
1163,DANTE,1163,Thanks for the vote of confidence.
1164,CAITLIN,1164,Was I right?
1165,DANTE,1165,"Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is
more like it. Mildly disturbed even."
1166,CAITLIN,1166,"I love a macho façade. It's such a
turn-on."
1167,CAITLIN,1167,What smells like shoe polish?
1168,DANTE,1168,"And you came here to what? To
comfort me?"
1169,CAITLIN,1169,"The last thing I needed was for you
to think I was hiding something
from you."
1170,DANTE,1170,But you were.
1171,CAITLIN,1171,"No, I wasn't. Not really. I told
you'd I'd been seeing other people."
1172,DANTE,1172,"Yeah, but not seriously. Christ,
you're ready to walk down the
aisle-I'd say that constitutes
something more than just seeing
somebody."
1173,CAITLIN,1173,I'm giving him his ring back.
1174,DANTE,1174,What?
1175,CAITLIN,1175,"I don't want to marry him. I don't
want to get married now. I'm on the
verge of graduation. I want to go
to grad school after this. And then
I want to start a career. I don't
want to be a wife first, and then
have to worry about when I'' going
to fit in all of the other stuff.
I've come way too far and studied
too hard to let my education go to
waste as a housewife. And I know
that's what I'd become. Sang's
already signed with a major firm,
and he's going to be pulling a huge
salary, which would give me no
reason to work, and he's so
traditional anyway..."
1176,DANTE,1176,Sang? His name is a past tense?
1177,CAITLIN,1177,Stop it. He's a nice guy.
1178,DANTE,1178,"If he's so nice, why aren't you
going to marry him?"
1179,CAITLIN,1179,I just told you.
1180,DANTE,1180,"There's more, isn't there?"
1181,CAITLIN,1181,"Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?"
1182,DANTE,1182,"Tell me I don't have something to
do with it."
1183,CAITLIN,1183,"You don't have anything to do with
it."
1184,DANTE,1184,You lie.
1185,CAITLIN,1185,Look how full of yourself you are.
1186,DANTE,1186,"I just believe in giving credit
where credit is due. And I believe
that I'm the impetus behind your
failure to wed."
1187,CAITLIN,1187,"If I'm so nuts about you, then why
am I having sex with an Asian
design major?"
1188,DANTE,1188,"Jesus, you're caustic."
1189,CAITLIN,1189,"I had to bring you down from that
cloud you were floating on. When I
say I don't want to get married, I
mean just that. I don't want to
marry anybody. Not for years."
1190,DANTE,1190,"So who's asking? I don't want to
marry you."
1191,CAITLIN,1191,Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
1192,DANTE,1192,Buy can we date?
1193,CAITLIN,1193,"I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would
like that."
1194,DANTE,1194,"We could introduce them. They might
hit it off."
1195,CAITLIN,1195,"You're serious. You want to date
again."
1196,DANTE,1196,"I would like to be your boyfriend,
yes."
1197,CAITLIN,1197,"It's just the shock of seeing me
after three years. Believe me,
you'll get over it."
1198,DANTE,1198,"Give me a bit more credit. I think
it's time we got back together, you
know. I'm more mature, you're more
mature, you're finishing college,
I'm already in the job market..."
1199,CAITLIN,1199,"You work in a market, all right."
1200,DANTE,1200,"Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to
go out again. After all the talking
we've been doing."
1201,CAITLIN,1201,"The key word here is talk, Dante. I
think the idea, the conception of
us dating is more idyllic than what
actually happens when we date."
1202,DANTE,1202,"So...what? So we should just make
pretend over the phone that we're
dating?"
1203,CAITLIN,1203,"I don't know. Maybe we should just
see what happens."
1204,DANTE,1204,Let me take you out tonight.
1205,CAITLIN,1205,"You mean, on a date?"
1206,DANTE,1206,Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
1207,CAITLIN,1207,"The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie
Date. I think I've been on that one
before."
1208,DANTE,1208,You have a better suggestion?
1209,CAITLIN,1209,"How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on
the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked
Somewhere Kind of Private Date?"
1210,DANTE,1210,I hear that's a rather popular date.
1211,CAITLIN,1211,"Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at
you, succumbing to your wily
charms, and you call me a slut, in
so many words."
1212,DANTE,1212,What about Sing?
1213,CAITLIN,1213,Sang.
1214,DANTE,1214,Sang.
1215,CAITLIN,1215,He's not invited.
1216,DANTE,1216,He's your fiancé.
1217,CAITLIN,1217,"I offer you my body and you offer
me semantics? He's just a boyfriend,
Dante, and in case you haven't
gotten the drift of why I came all
the way here from Ohio, I'm about
to become single again."
1218,CAITLIN (CONT'D),1218,"And yes-let me placate your ego-you
are the inspiration for this bold
and momentous decision, for which
I'll probably be ostracized at both
school and home. You ask me who I
choose, I choose you."
1219,DANTE,1219,So what are you saying?
1220,CAITLIN,1220,You're such an asshole.
1221,DANTE,1221,I'm just kidding.
1222,CAITLIN,1222,"I can already tell this isn't going
to work."
1223,DANTE,1223,"I'll ask Randal to close up for me-
when he gets back."
1224,CAITLIN,1224,"Where'd he go? I'd have thought
he'd be at your side, like an
obedient lapdog."
1225,DANTE,1225,"He went to rent a movie, but he
hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw
it; I'll just lock the store up and
leave him a note."
1226,CAITLIN,1226,"You're too responsible. But no. I
have to go home first. They don't
even know I left school. And I
should break the disengagement news
to my mother, which is going to
cause quite a row, considering she
loves Sang."
1227,DANTE,1227,Who doesn't?
1228,CAITLIN,1228,"Well, me I guess."
1229,CAITLIN,1229,"So, I shall take my leave of you,
but I will return in a little
while, at which time-yes-I would
love to go for dinner and a movie
with you."
1230,DANTE,1230,"What happened to the walk and the
nakedness?"
1231,CAITLIN,1231,"I'm easy, but I'm not that easy."
1232,CAITLIN,1232,"See you later, handsome."
1233,DANTE,1233,YES!
1234,RANDAL,1234,Get to work.
1235,DANTE,1235,What'd you rent?
1236,DANTE,1236,Best of Both Worlds?
1237,RANDAL,1237,"Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with
both organs. You should see the
box: Beautiful women with dicks
that put mine to shame."
1238,DANTE,1238,And this is what you rented?
1239,RANDAL,1239,I like to expand my horizons.
1240,DANTE,1240,"I got fined for selling cigarettes
to a minor."
1241,RANDAL,1241,No way!
1242,DANTE,1242,Five hundred dollars.
1243,RANDAL,1243,You're bullshitting.
1244,RANDAL,1244,"I didn't think they even enforced
this."
1245,DANTE,1245,Living proof.
1246,RANDAL,1246,"I thought you never sold cigarettes
to kids."
1247,DANTE,1247,I don't; you did.
1248,RANDAL,1248,Really?
1249,DANTE,1249,Little girl. Maybe five years old?
1250,RANDAL,1250,Holy shit. That girl?
1251,DANTE,1251,"As opposed to the hundreds of other
children you let buy cigarettes
whenever you work here."
1252,RANDAL,1252,Then how come you got the fine?
1253,DANTE,1253,Because I'm here.
1254,RANDAL,1254,You're lying.
1255,DANTE,1255,"I swear. I couldn't make this kind
of hell up."
1256,RANDAL,1256,"Then why aren't you like screaming
at me right now?"
1257,DANTE,1257,Because I'm happy.
1258,RANDAL,1258,You're happy?
1259,DANTE,1259,I'm happy.
1260,RANDAL,1260,You're happy to get a fine?
1261,DANTE,1261,"No. I'm happy because Caitlin came
to see me."
1262,RANDAL,1262,Now I know you're lying.
1263,DANTE,1263,I'm not. She just left.
1264,RANDAL,1264,What did she say?
1265,DANTE,1265,"She's not going to marry that guy.
She went home to tell her mother."
1266,RANDAL,1266,You're kidding.
1267,DANTE,1267,I'm not.
1268,RANDAL,1268,Wow. You've had quite an evening.
1269,DANTE,1269,"She went home, she's getting ready,
and we're going out."
1270,RANDAL,1270,"I feel so ineffectual. Is there
anything I can do for you?"
1271,DANTE,1271,"Watch the store while I go home and
change."
1272,RANDAL,1272,"What happened to title dictates
behavior?"
1273,DANTE,1273,"This is my way of spitting water at
life."
1274,RANDAL,1274,"Hey, what about Veronica?"
1275,DANTE,1275,"No! Don't bring it up. I don't want
to think about that now. Let me
enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll
think about all of that later. In
the meantime, nobody mentions the V
word."
1276,RANDAL,1276,You're a snake.
1277,DANTE,1277,"In my absence, try not to sell
cigarettes to any newborns."
1278,RANDAL,1278,"You want me to bring the VCR over
here so we can watch this?"
1279,DANTE,1279,"I might be leaving early to go out
with Caitlin, in which case you'll
have to close the store tonight."
1280,RANDAL,1280,"All right, but you're missing out.
Chicks with dicks."
1281,DANTE,1281,I'll read the book.
1282,CUSTOMER,1282,Cute cat. What's his name.
1283,RANDAL,1283,Peptic ulcer.
1284,CAITLIN,1284,"Randal Graves-scourge of the video
renter."
1285,RANDAL,1285,"Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian
Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!"
1286,CAITLIN,1286,"You saw that article? God, isn't it
awful? My mother sent that in."
1287,RANDAL,1287,I take it she likes the guy.
1288,CAITLIN,1288,"You'd think she was marrying him.
What are you watching?"
1289,RANDAL,1289,"Children's programming. What did
your mom say when you told her you
weren't engaged anymore?"
1290,CAITLIN,1290,"She said not to come home until
graduation."
1291,RANDAL,1291,"Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?"
1292,CAITLIN,1292,"What can I say? He does weird
things to me."
1293,RANDAL,1293,Can I watch?
1294,CAITLIN,1294,You can hold me down.
1295,RANDAL,1295,Can I join in?
1296,CAITLIN,1296,"You might be let down. I'm not a
hermaphrodite."
1297,RANDAL,1297,"Few are. So what makes you think
you can maintain a relationship
with Dante this time around?"
1298,CAITLIN,1298,"A woman's intuition. Something in
me says it's time to give the old
boy a serious try."
1299,RANDAL,1299,"Wow. Hey, I was just about to order
some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?"
1300,CAITLIN,1300,Dick.
1301,RANDAL,1301,Exactly.
1302,CAITLIN,1302,So where is he?
1303,RANDAL,1303,"He went home to change for the big
date."
1304,CAITLIN,1304,"God, isn't he great?"
1305,RANDAL,1305,"No, this is great."
1306,CAITLIN,1306,Can I use the bathroom?
1307,RANDAL,1307,There's no light back there.
1308,CAITLIN,1308,Why aren't there any lights?
1309,RANDAL,1309,"Well, there are, but for some
reason they stop working at five-
fourteen every night."
1310,CAITLIN,1310,You're kidding.
1311,RANDAL,1311,"Nobody can figure it out. And the
boss doesn't want to pay the
electrician to fix it, because the
electrician owes money to the video
store."
1312,CAITLIN,1312,Such a sordid state of affair.
1313,RANDAL,1313,"And I'm caught in the middle-torn
between my loyalty for the boss,
and my desire to piss with the
light on."
1314,CAITLIN,1314,I'll try to manage.
1315,RANDAL,1315,Hey Caitlin...
1316,RANDAL,1316,"Break his heart again this time,
and I'll kill you. Nothing personal."
1317,CAITLIN,1317,"You're very protective of him,
Randal. You always have been."
1318,RANDAL,1318,Territoriality. He was mine first.
1319,CAITLIN,1319,Awww. That was so cute.
1320,MOTHER,1320,A pack of cigarettes.
1321,SMALL CHILD,1321,Cunt!
1322,DANTE,1322,Who eats cock?
1323,RANDAL,1323,Bunch of savages in this town.
1324,RANDAL,1324,"Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You
might want to see if she's okay;
she's been back there a long time."
1325,DANTE,1325,There's no lights back there.
1326,RANDAL,1326,"I told her that. She said she
didn't need any. Why don't you join
her, man. Make a little bathroom
bam-bam."
1327,DANTE,1327,"I love your sexy talk. It's
so...kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee."
1328,RANDAL,1328,Fuck you.
1329,CAITLIN,1329,How'd you get here so fast?
1330,DANTE,1330,I left like an hour ago.
1331,CAITLIN,1331,"Do you always talk weird after you
violate women?"
1332,RANDAL,1332,"Maybe the Asian design major
slipped her some opium?"
1333,DANTE,1333,Could be.
1334,CAITLIN,1334,Promise me it'll always be like that.
1335,DANTE,1335,Like what?
1336,CAITLIN,1336,"When you just lie perfectly still
and let me do everything."
1337,DANTE,1337,Um...okay.
1338,RANDAL,1338,Am I missing something here?
1339,CAITLIN,1339,"I went back there, and Dante was
already waiting for me."
1340,RANDAL,1340,He was?
1341,CAITLIN,1341,"It was so cool. He didn't say a
word. He was just...ready, you know?
And we didn't kiss or talk or
anything. He just sat there and let
me do all the work."
1342,RANDAL,1342,"You dog! I didn't see you go back
there."
1343,CAITLIN,1343,"And the fact that there weren't any
lights made it so..."
1344,CAITLIN,1344,God! That was so great!
1345,DANTE,1345,It wasn't me.
1346,CAITLIN,1346,"Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?"
1347,DANTE,1347,Was it you?
1348,RANDAL,1348,I was here the whole time.
1349,CAITLIN,1349,You two better quit it.
1350,DANTE,1350,I'm serious.
1351,CAITLIN,1351,"We didn't just have sex in the
bathroom?"
1352,DANTE,1352,No.
1353,CAITLIN,1353,Stop this. This isn't funny.
1354,DANTE,1354,"I'm not kidding. I just got back
from outside."
1355,CAITLIN,1355,"This isn't fucking funny, Dante!"
1356,DANTE,1356,I'm not fooling around!
1357,DANTE,1357,Who went back there?
1358,RANDAL,1358,Nobody! I swear!
1359,CAITLIN,1359,I feel nauseous.
1360,DANTE,1360,Are you sure somebody was back there?
1361,CAITLIN,1361,"I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus,
I'm going to be sick!"
1362,RANDAL,1362,You just fucked a total stranger?
1363,DANTE,1363,Shut the fuck up!
1364,CAITLIN,1364,I can't believe this! I feel faint...
1365,DANTE,1365,Call the police.
1366,RANDAL,1366,Why?
1367,CAITLIN,1367,"No, don't!"
1368,DANTE,1368,"There's a strange man in our
bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!"
1369,CAITLIN,1369,Oh God...
1370,RANDAL,1370,She said she did all the work.
1371,DANTE,1371,WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?
1372,DANTE,1372,WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
1373,CORONER (O.C.),1373,Who is he?
1374,DANTE,1374,"I don't know. He just came in and
asked to use the bathroom."
1375,CORONER,1375,What time was this?
1376,DANTE,1376,Um...I don't know.
1377,DANTE,1377,What time did hockey end?
1378,RANDAL,1378,Around three or something.
1379,DANTE,1379,What time did we go to the funeral?
1380,RANDAL,1380,I think four.
1381,CORONER,1381,"Wait a second? Who was working here
today?"
1382,DANTE,1382,Just me.
1383,CORONER,1383,"I thought you just said you played
hockey and went to a funeral."
1384,DANTE,1384,We did.
1385,CORONER,1385,Then who operated the store?
1386,DANTE,1386,Nobody. It was closed.
1387,CORONER,1387,With this guy locked in?
1388,DANTE,1388,"Everything happened at once. I
guess I forgot he was back there."
1389,ATTENDANT 1,1389,Can we take this now?
1390,CORONER,1390,Go ahead.
1391,DANTE,1391,Was he alive when...Caitlin...
1392,CORONER,1392,"No. I place the time of death at
about three-twenty."
1393,RANDAL,1393,Then how could she...you know...
1394,CORONER,1394,"The body can maintain an erection
after expiration. Sometimes for
hours. Did he have the adult
magazine when he came in?"
1395,DANTE,1395,No. I gave it to him.
1396,DANTE,1396,Well he asked me for it!
1397,CORONER,1397,"I can't say for certain until we
get him back to the lab, but my
guess is he was masturbating, his
heart seized and he died. That's
when the girl found him."
1398,CORONER,1398,Something smells like shoe polish.
1399,RANDAL,1399,"This has gotta be the weirdest
thing you've ever been called in on."
1400,CORONER,1400,"Actually, I once had to tag a kid
that broke his neck trying to put
his mouth on his penis."
1401,DANTE,1401,What about Caitlin?
1402,CORONER,1402,"Shock trauma. She's going to need
years of therapy after this. My
question is, How did she come to
have sex with the dead man?"
1403,DANTE,1403,She thought it was me.
1404,CORONER,1404,"What kind of convenience store do
you run here?"
1405,RANDAL,1405,"Do you think he was talking about
my cousin?"
1406,JAY,1406,"I knew one of those motherfuckers
was gonna kill somebody one day."
1407,RANDAL (O.C.),1407,"Da-dum! Da-dum! Da-dum! DA-DUM! DA-
DUM! DA-DUM!"
1408,RANDAL,1408,Salsa shark.
1409,RANDAL,1409,"""We're gonna need a bigger boat."""
1410,RANDAL,1410,"""Man goes into the cage; cage goes
into the salsa; shark's in the
salsa; our shark."""
1411,RANDAL,1411,"What? What's with you? You haven't
said anything for like twenty
minutes. What the hell is your
problem?"
1412,DANTE,1412,This life.
1413,RANDAL,1413,This life?
1414,DANTE,1414,Why do I have this life?
1415,RANDAL,1415,Have some chips; you'll feel better.
1416,DANTE,1416,"I'm stuck in this pit, earning less
than slave wages, working on my day
off, dealing with every backward
fuck on the planet, the goddam
steel shutters are locked all day,
I smell like shoe polish, I've got
an ex-girlfriend who's catatonic
after fucking a dead guy, and my
present girlfriend has sucked
thirty-six dicks."
1417,RANDAL,1417,Thirty-seven.
1418,DANTE,1418,"My life is in the shitter right
about now, so if you don't mind,
I'd like to stew a bit."
1419,CUSTOMER (O.C.),1419,You open?
1420,RANDAL,1420,Yeah.
1421,RANDAL (O.C.),1421,"That's all bullshit. You know what
the real problem here is?"
1422,DANTE,1422,I was born.
1423,RANDAL,1423,You should shit or get off the pot.
1424,DANTE,1424,I should shit or get off the pot.
1425,RANDAL,1425,"Yeah, you should shit or get off
the pot."
1426,DANTE,1426,What are you talking about?
1427,RANDAL,1427,"I'm talking about this thing you
have...this inability to improve
your situation in life."
1428,DANTE,1428,Fuck you.
1429,RANDAL,1429,"It's true. You'll sit there and
blame life for dealing a cruddy
hand, never once accepting the
responsibility for the way your
situation is."
1430,DANTE,1430,What responsibility?
1431,RANDAL,1431,"All right, if you hate this job and
the people, and the fact that you
have to come in on your day off,
then quit."
1432,DANTE,1432,As if it's that easy.
1433,RANDAL,1433,"It is. You just up and quit. There
are other jobs, and they pay better
money. You're bound to be qualified
for at least one of them. So what's
stopping you?"
1434,DANTE,1434,Leave me alone.
1435,RANDAL,1435,"You're comfortable. This is a life
of convenience for you, and any
attempt to change it would shatter
the pathetic microcosm you've
fashioned for yourself."
1436,DANTE,1436,"Oh, like your life's any better?"
1437,RANDAL,1437,"I'm satisfied with my situation for
now. You don't hear me bitching.
You, on the other hand, have been
bitching all day."
1438,DANTE,1438,"Thank you. Why don't you go back to
the video store?"
1439,RANDAL,1439,It's the same thing with Veronica.
1440,DANTE,1440,Leave her out of this.
1441,RANDAL,1441,"You date Veronica because she's low
maintenance and because it's
convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever
do is talk about Caitlin. You carry
a torch for a girl you dated in
high school-in high school for
God's sake! You're twenty-two!"
1442,DANTE,1442,Leave me alone.
1443,RANDAL,1443,"If you want Caitlin, then face
Veronica, tell her, and be with
Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be
with Veronica. But don't pine for
one and fuck the other. Man, if you
weren't such a fucking coward..."
1444,DANTE,1444,"...If I wasn't such a fucking
coward."
1445,DANTE,1445,"It must be so great to be able to
simplify everything the way you do."
1446,RANDAL,1446,Am I right or what?
1447,DANTE,1447,"You're wrong. Things happened
today, okay? Things that probably
ruined my chances with Caitlin."
1448,RANDAL,1448,"What? The dead guy? She'll get over
fucking the dead guy. Shit, my
mom's been fucking a dead guy for
thirty years; I call him Dad."
1449,DANTE,1449,"Caitlin and I can't be together.
It's impossible."
1450,RANDAL,1450,"Melodrama coming from you seems
about as natural as an oral bowel
movement."
1451,DANTE,1451,"What do you want me to say? Yes, I
suppose some of the things you're
saying may be true. But that's the
way things are; it's not going to
change."
1452,RANDAL,1452,Make them change.
1453,DANTE,1453,"I can't, all right! Jesus, would
you leave me alone? I can't make
changes like that in my life. If I
could, I would-but I don't have the
ability to risk comfortable
situations on the big money and the
fabulous prizes."
1454,RANDAL,1454,Who're you kidding? You can so.
1455,DANTE,1455,"Jesus H. Christ, I can't!"
1456,RANDAL,1456,"So you'll continue being miserable
all the time, just because you
don't have the guts to face change?"
1457,DANTE,1457,"My mother told me once that when I
as three, my potty lid was closed,
and instead of lifting it, I chose
to shit my pants."
1458,RANDAL,1458,Lovely story.
1459,DANTE,1459,"Point is-I'm not the kind of person
that disrupts things in order to
shit comfortably."
1460,JAY,1460,"Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking
weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!
Drinking beers!"
1461,JAY,1461,"A pack of wraps, my good man. It's
time to kick back, drink some
beers, and smoke some weed!"
1462,DANTE,1462,Done poisoning the youth for the day?
1463,JAY,1463,"Hell yes, whatever that means. Now
I'm gonna head over to Atlantic,
drink some beers, get ripped, and-
please God-get laid."
1464,JAY,1464,"E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs."
1465,DANTE,1465,One seventy-nine.
1466,JAY,1466,Pay the good man.
1467,JAY,1467,Don't you close soon?
1468,DANTE,1468,A half hour.
1469,JAY,1469,"We get off about the same time
every night. We should hang out.
You get high?"
1470,DANTE,1470,I should start.
1471,JAY,1471,"Wanna come to this party tonight?
There's gonna be some pussy there,
man!"
1472,DANTE,1472,With you? I don't think so.
1473,JAY,1473,"Listen to you. Oh shit. ""Oh, I
don't hang out with drug dealers."""
1474,DANTE,1474,Nothing personal.
1475,JAY,1475,"I work, just like you. You're more
of a crook than I am, dude."
1476,DANTE,1476,"How do you figure...HEY! You can't
roll a joint in here!"
1477,JAY,1477,"Relax brother. What I mean is that
you sell the stuff in this store at
the highest prices around. A dollar
seventy-nine for wraps-what's that
shit?"
1478,DANTE,1478,It's not my store.
1479,JAY,1479,"And these aren't my drugs-I just
sell them."
1480,DANTE,1480,"The difference is you exploit a
weakness."
1481,JAY,1481,What's that mean?
1482,DANTE,1482,"You sell to people that can't stay
away from an addiction."
1483,JAY,1483,All right. How much is Pepsi here?
1484,DANTE,1484,"A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax."
1485,JAY,1485,"At Food City it's ninety-nine
cents, plus tax."
1486,DANTE,1486,So.
1487,JAY,1487,"So why do you sell it for so much
more? I'll tell you why-because
people come here and they're like
""A dollar eighty for soda? I should
get it at Food City. But I don't
feel like driving there. I'll just
buy it here so I don't have to
drive up there."" That's exploiting
a weakness, too, isn't it?"
1488,DANTE,1488,"I can't believe you just rolled a
joint in here."
1489,JAY,1489,"Hey, man, what happened with that
old guy?"
1490,DANTE,1490,He died in the bathroom.
1491,JAY,1491,"That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he
was jerkin' off."
1492,DANTE,1492,I don't know. I wasn't watching.
1493,JAY,1493,"Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I
know I felt like beatin' it when I
saw her."
1494,JAY,1494,"Come here, bitch! You like this? Is
this what you want? Hunhh?"
1495,DANTE,1495,"Knock it off. That used to be my
girlfriend."
1496,JAY,1496,You used to go out with her?
1497,DANTE,1497,"We were going to start again, I
think."
1498,JAY,1498,Don't you already have a girlfriend?
1499,DANTE,1499,Veronica.
1500,JAY,1500,"Is she that girl who's down here
all the time? She came here today
carrying a plate of food."
1501,DANTE,1501,Lasagne.
1502,JAY,1502,"And what-you were gonna dump her to
date that Caitlin chick?"
1503,DANTE,1503,Maybe.
1504,JAY,1504,"I don't know dude. That Caitlin
chick's nice. But I see that
Veronica girl doing shit for you
all the time. She brings you food,
she rubs your back...Didn't I see
her change your tire one day?"
1505,DANTE,1505,"I jacked the car up. All she did
was loosen the nuts and put the
tire on."
1506,JAY,1506,Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
1507,DANTE,1507,She's my girlfriend.
1508,JAY,1508,"I've had girlfriends, but all they
wanted from me was weed and shit."
1509,JAY,1509,"Shit, my grandma used to say,
""Which is better: a good plate with
nothing on it..."" No, wait. I
fucked up. She said ""What's a good-
looking plate with nothing on it?"""
1510,DANTE,1510,Meaning?
1511,JAY,1511,"I don't know. She was senile and
shit. Used to piss herself all the
time. C'mon Silent Bob."
1512,SILENT BOB,1512,"You know, there's a million fine-
looking women in the world, but
they don't all bring you lasagne at
work. Most of them just cheat on you."
1513,DANTE,1513,He's right. I love her.
1514,RANDAL,1514,"So that's it. He doesn't love you
anymore. He loves Caitlin."
1515,VERONICA,1515,And...he told you all of this?
1516,RANDAL,1516,"Pretty much. All except the latent
homosexuality part-that's just my
theory."
1517,VERONICA,1517,I...I don't know what to say.
1518,RANDAL,1518,"Don't hold it against him. He just
never got Caitlin out of his system.
It's not your fault. It's Dante."
1519,RANDAL,1519,"I don't know thing one about chicks.
Do you want to cry or something? I
can leave."
1520,VERONICA,1520,I'm not sad.
1521,RANDAL,1521,You're not?
1522,VERONICA,1522,"No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed
off. I feel like he's been killing
time while he tries to grow the
balls to tell me how he really
feels, and then he can't even do it!
He has his friend do it for him!"
1523,RANDAL,1523,He didn't ask me to...
1524,VERONICA,1524,"After all that I've done for that
fuck! And he wants to be with that
slut? Fine! He can have his slut!"
1525,RANDAL,1525,"Um, do you think you can give me a
lift home tonight?"
1526,VERONICA,1526,"I'm going to have a word with that
asshole."
1527,RANDAL,1527,Wait! Veronica...I don't think...
1528,RANDAL,1528,"What am I worried about? He'll
probably be glad I started the ball
rolling. All he ever did was
complain about her anyway. I'm just
looking out for his best interests.
I mean, that's what a friend does,
am I right? I did him a favor."
1529,CUSTOMER,1529,Oooh! Navy Seals!
1530,DANTE,1530,What the fuck did you do that for?
1531,VERONICA,1531,"If you didn't want to go out with
me anymore, why didn't you just say
it? Instead, you pussyfoot around
and see that slut behind my back!"
1532,DANTE,1532,What're you talking about?
1533,VERONICA,1533,"You've been talking to her on the
phone for weeks!"
1534,DANTE,1534,It was only a few times...
1535,VERONICA,1535,"And then you pull that shit this
morning, freaking out because I've
gone down on a couple guys!"
1536,DANTE,1536,A couple...?
1537,VERONICA,1537,"I'm not the one trying to patch
things up with my ex, sneaking
around behind your back! And if you
think that thirty-seven dicks are a
lot, then just wait, mister: I'm
going to put the hookers in Times
Square to shame with all the guys I
go down on now!"
1538,DANTE,1538,Would you let me explain...
1539,VERONICA,1539,"Explain what? How you were waiting
until the time was right, and then
you were going to dump me for her?"
1540,DANTE,1540,"Veronica...I...it's not like that
anymore...I mean, it was never
really like that..."
1541,VERONICA,1541,"You're damn right it's not like
that! Because I won't let it be
like that! You want your slut? Fine!
The slut is yours!"
1542,DANTE,1542,I don't want Caitlin...
1543,VERONICA,1543,"You don't know what you want, but
I'm not going to sit here anymore
holding your hand until you figure
it out! I've encouraged you to get
out of this fucking dump and go
back to school, to take charge of
your life and find direction. I
even transferred so maybe you would
be more inclined to go back to
college if I was with you. Everyone
said it was a stupid move, but I
didn't care because I loved you and
wanted to see you pull yourself out
of this senseless funk you've been
in since that whore dumped you, oh
so many years ago. And now you want
to go back to her so she can fuck
you over some more?"
1544,DANTE,1544,I don't want to go back with her...
1545,VERONICA,1545,"Of course not; not now! You're
caught, and now you're trying to
snake out of doing what you wanted
to do. Well, I won't let you. I
want you to follow through on this,
just so you can find out what a
fucking idiot you are. And when she
dumps you again-and she will,
Dante, I promise you that-when she
dumps you again, I want to laugh at
you, right in your face, just so
you realize that that was what you
gave up our relationship for!"
1546,VERONICA,1546,"I'm just glad Randal had the balls
to tell me, since you couldn't."
1547,DANTE,1547,Randal...?
1548,VERONICA,1548,"And having him tell me...that was
just the weakest move ever. You're
spineless."
1549,DANTE,1549,"Veronica, I love you..."
1550,VERONICA,1550,Fuck you.
1551,RANDAL,1551,Dante?
1552,RANDAL,1552,How's your eye?
1553,DANTE,1553,"The swelling's not so bad. But the
FDS stings."
1554,DANTE,1554,How's your neck?
1555,RANDAL,1555,It's hard to swallow.
1556,RANDAL,1556,You didn't have to choke me.
1557,DANTE,1557,"Why the fuck did you tell Veronica
that I was going to dump her for
Caitlin?"
1558,RANDAL,1558,I thought I was doing you a favor.
1559,DANTE,1559,Thanks.
1560,RANDAL,1560,"You were saying how you couldn't
initiate change yourself, so I
figured I'd help you out."
1561,DANTE,1561,Jesus.
1562,RANDAL,1562,You still didn't have to choke me.
1563,DANTE,1563,"Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't
kill you."
1564,RANDAL,1564,Why do you say that?
1565,DANTE,1565,"Why do I say that? Randal...forget
it."
1566,RANDAL,1566,"No, really. What did I do that was
so wrong?"
1567,DANTE,1567,"What don't you do? Randal, sometimes
it seems like the only reason you
come to work is to make my life
miserable."
1568,RANDAL,1568,How do you figure?
1569,DANTE,1569,What time did you get to work today?
1570,RANDAL,1570,Like ten after.
1571,DANTE,1571,"You were over half an hour late.
Then all you do is come over here."
1572,RANDAL,1572,To talk to you.
1573,DANTE,1573,"Which means the video store is
ostensibly closed."
1574,RANDAL,1574,It's not like I'm miles away.
1575,DANTE,1575,"Unless you're out renting videos at
other video stores."
1576,RANDAL,1576,"Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we
could watch it together!"
1577,DANTE,1577,"You get my slapped with a fine, you
fight with the customers and I have
to patch everything up. You get us
chased out of a funeral by violating
a corpse. To top it all off, you
ruin my relationship. What's your
encore? Do you anally rape my
mother while pouring sugar in my
gas tank?"
1578,DANTE (CONT'D),1578,"You know what the real tragedy is?
I'm not even supposed to be here
today!"
1579,RANDAL,1579,"Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to
you trying to pass the buck again.
I'm the source of all your misery.
Who closed the store to play hockey?
Who closed the store to attend a
wake? Who tried to win back an ex-
girlfriend without even discussing
how he felt with his present one?
You wanna blame somebody, blame
yourself."
1580,RANDAL,1580,"""I'm not even supposed to be here
today."""
1581,RANDAL,1581,"You sound like an asshole. Whose
choice was it to be here today?
Nobody twisted your arm. You're
here today of your own violation,
my friend. But you'd like to
believe that the weight of the
world rests on your shoulders-that
the store would crumble if Dante
wasn't here. Well, I got news for
you, jerk: This store would survive
without you. Without me either. All
you do is overcompensate for having
what's basically a monkey's job:
You push fucking buttons. Any moron
can waltz in here and do our jobs,
but you're obsessed with making it
seem so much more fucking important,
so much more epic than it really is.
You work in a convenience store,
Dante. And badly, I might add. And
I work in a shitty video store.
Badly, as well."
1582,RANDAL,1582,"You know, that guy Jay's got it
right-he has no delusions about
what he does. Us? We like to make
ourselves seem so much better than
the people that come in here, just
looking to pick up a paper or-God
forbid-cigarettes. We look down on
them, as it we're so advanced.
Well, if we're so fucking advanced,
then what are we doing working here?"
1583,RANDAL,1583,"I threw out the stuff that got
broken. The floor looks clean."
1584,DANTE,1584,You need a ride?
1585,RANDAL,1585,Got one. Just pulled up.
1586,DANTE,1586,Do you work tomorrow?
1587,RANDAL,1587,Same time. What about you?
1588,DANTE,1588,"I'm calling out. Going to hit the
hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then
try to see Veronica."
1589,RANDAL,1589,"You wanna grab something to eat
tomorrow night...after I get out of
here?"
1590,DANTE,1590,I'll call you. Let you know.
1591,RANDAL,1591,"All right. Good luck with Veronica.
If you want, I can talk to her, you
know, and explain..."
1592,DANTE,1592,"No thanks. I'll take care of it.
We've got a lot of shit to talk
about."
1593,RANDAL,1593,Helluva day.
1594,DANTE,1594,To say the least.
1595,RANDAL,1595,"Do you need a hug or something?
'Cause I would have no hang-ups
about hugging you...you know, you
being a guy and all. Just don't
knead my ass when you do it."
1596,DANTE,1596,Get the fuck outta here already.
1597,RANDAL,1597,I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
1598,RANDAL,1598,You're closed.
1599,DANTE,1599,What'd you forget something?
1600,DANTE,1600,"Oh. I'm sorry, we're closed."
1601,CUSTOMER,1601,Hello? Little help?
