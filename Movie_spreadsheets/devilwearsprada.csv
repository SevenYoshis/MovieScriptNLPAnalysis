0,2963,ANDY,0,"What floor is Elias-Clarke? Human
Resources."
1,2964,GUARD,1,"Honey, you want West 57th."
2,2965,CLACKER #1,2,"You look awesome today. I can't wear
cropped pants. I look like a whale."
3,2966,CLACKER #2,3,"Oh, please. I look terrible. I almost
called in fat today."
4,2967,ANDY,4,"This article was about the Take Back
the Night march. This was a four-part
series on the impact of busing on the
public schools..."
5,2968,SHERRY,5,"I have two positions available. One is
assistant to the road test editor of
Auto Universe magazine."
6,2969,ANDY,6,And the other one--?
7,2970,ANDY,7,"Hi, I have an appointment with Emily
Charlton--"
8,2971,EMILY (O.S.),8,Andrea Sachs?
9,2972,EMILY (CONT'D),9,"Human Resources certainly has a
bizarre sense of humor."
10,2973,EMILY (CONT'D),10,Follow me.
11,2974,EMILY,11,"Okay, so... I was Miranda's second
assistant, but her first assistant
recently got promoted so now I'm the
first..."
12,2975,ANDY,12,And you're replacing yourself.
13,2976,EMILY,13,"I'm trying. Miranda sacked the last
two girls after only a few weeks. We
need to find someone who can survive
here. Do you understand?"
14,2977,ANDY,14,Yes. Of course. Who's Miranda?
15,2978,EMILY,15,"You didn't just ask me that. She's the
editor in chief of Runway. Not to
mention a legend. Work a year for her
and you can get a job at any magazine
you want. A million girls would kill
for this job."
16,2979,ANDY,16,"Sounds great. I'd love to be
considered."
17,2980,EMILY,17,"Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine.
An interest in fashion is crucial."
18,2981,ANDY,18,"What makes you think I'm not
interested in fashion?"
19,2982,EMILY,19,"Oh my God. No. No, no, no."
20,2983,ANDY,20,What's wrong?
21,2984,EMILY,21,She's on her way -- tell everyone!
22,2985,NIGEL,22,I thought she was coming in at 9.
23,2986,EMILY,23,"Her driver text-messaged. Her
facialist ruptured a disk. God, these
people!"
24,2987,EMILY (CONT'D),24,I can't even talk about it.
25,2988,NIGEL,25,"All right, everyone. Man your battle
stations!"
26,2989,NIGEL,26,Did somebody eat an onion bagel?
27,2990,CLACKER,27,"Sorry, Miranda."
28,2991,EMILY,28,Oh no. You're still here. Go.
29,2992,EMILY (CONT'D),29,"No, stay. I don't want you walking
past her. Just sit there and I'll pray
she doesn't notice you marring the
area."
30,2993,ANDY,30,"Wow, this is like self-esteem camp."
31,2994,MIRANDA,31,"I don't understand why it's so
difficult to confirm an appointment."
32,2995,EMILY,32,"I'm so sorry, Miranda. I did confirm
last night, but--"
33,2996,MIRANDA,33,"The details of your incompetence do
not interest me."
34,2997,MIRANDA (CONT'D),34,"Tell Simone I'm not approving the girl
she sent in for the Brazil layout. I
wanted clean, athletic, and smiling
not dirty, tired and paunchy..."
35,2998,MIRANDA (CONT'D),35,"RSVP yes to the Michael Kors party --
the car will drop me at 9:30 and wait
until I leave at 9:45... Tell Natalie
at Glorious Foods for the fortieth
time -- no, I don't want the tortes
filled with warm rhubarb compote. I
want the chopped almonds."
36,2999,MIRANDA (CONT'D),36,"Call my ex-husband and remind him the
Parent-Teacher conferences at Dalton
are tonight. Then call my husband and
tell him to meet me for dinner at that
place I went with Massimo..."
37,3000,EMILY,37,Right.
38,3001,MIRANDA,38,"And tell Richard I saw the pictures of
for the feature on female paramedics
and they're all so unattractive. I
don't understand. How hard is it to
find a decent-looking paramedic?...
Also, I need to see what Nigel has
called in for Gwyneth's second cover
try..."
39,3002,MIRANDA (CONT'D),39,Who is that?
40,3003,EMILY,40,"Nobody. Human resources sent her up
about the assistant job and I was pre-
interviewing her for you, but--"
41,3004,MIRANDA,41,"I'll do it. The last two you sent me
were total disappointments. Send her
in."
42,3005,EMILY,42,She wants to see you.. Go go go....
43,3006,MIRANDA,43,Who are you?
44,3007,ANDY,44,"My name is Andy Sachs. I recently
graduated from--"
45,3008,MIRANDA,45,What are you doing here?
46,3009,ANDY,46,"I think I could do a good job as your
assistant and--"
47,3010,ANDY (CONT'D),47,"(fast, blurting)
I came to New York to be a journalist
and I sent letters to everyone and I
finally got a call from Elias-Clarke
and met with Sherry in Human Resources
and basically it's this or Auto
Universe."
48,3011,MIRANDA,48,So you don't read Runway?
49,3012,ANDY,49,No.
50,3013,MIRANDA,50,"And before today, you had never heard
of me?"
51,3014,ANDY,51,No.
52,3015,MIRANDA,52,"And you have no style or sense of
fashion."
53,3016,ANDY,53,That depends on--
54,3017,MIRANDA,54,That wasn't a question.
55,3018,ANDY,55,"I was Editor in Chief of the Daily
Northwestern. I won a national
competition for college journalists
with a series on the janitor's union --"
56,3019,MIRANDA,56,That's all.
57,3020,ANDY,57,--that uncovered the exploitation of--
58,3021,ANDY (CONT'D),58,"Okay, you're right. I don't fit in
here. I'm not glamorous or skinny and
I don't know much about fashion. But
I'm smart, I learn fast and I will
work very hard."
59,3022,NIGEL,59,"We got the exclusive on the yellow
Cavalli for Gwyneth, the one he showed
with a huge feathered headpiece, but
she'll look like she's working the
mainstage at the Golden Nugget, so
instead..."
60,3023,ANDY,60,Thank you for your time.
61,3024,NIGEL,61,"Who IS that sad little person? Are we
doing a Before and After piece I don't
know about?"
62,3025,EMILY,62,Andrea!
63,3026,NATE,63,"Wow. You got a job at a fashion
magazine."
64,3027,NATE,64,Was it a phone interview?
65,3028,ANDY,65,Don't be a jerk.
66,3029,DOUG,66,"Miranda Priestly is famous for being
unpredictable."
67,3030,ANDY,67,"Okay, how is it that you know who she
is and I didn't?"
68,3031,DOUG,68,I'm actually a girl.
69,3032,LILY,69,That would explain so much.
70,3033,DOUG,70,"Seriously, Miranda is a huge deal. I
bet a million girls would kill for
that job."
71,3034,ANDY,71,"Yeah, it's just that I'm not one of
them."
72,3035,LILY,72,"You have to start somewhere. Look at
this dump Nate works in. Paper
napkins? Hello?"
73,3036,NATE,73,And Lily works at that gallery doing--
74,3037,NATE,74,What the hell is it that you do?
75,3038,DOUG,75,"Lucky for me, I have my dream job."
76,3039,NATE,76,You're a corporate research analyst.
77,3040,DOUG,77,"-- which totally rocks. The free
bagels on Thursday? The booze? The
whores?"
78,3041,DOUG (CONT'D),78,"You're right. There are no bagels. And
only a few whores."
79,3042,ANDY,79,"You should see the way the girls dress
at Runway. I'm not sure I have
anything to wear to work."
80,3043,NATE,80,"You're going to be answering phones
and getting coffee. You need a
ballgown for that?"
81,3044,ANDY,81,I think I might.
82,3045,NATE,82,I think you look great. Always.
83,3046,ANDY,83,You are so full of it.
84,3047,NATE,84,"Come on. Let's go home. I can think of
something you can do without clothes."
85,3048,NATE (CONT'D),85,Asshole!
86,3049,ANDY,86,Hello? Now?
87,3050,EMILY,87,"Miranda decided to kill the Autumn
Jacket story for September -- she's
pulling up the Sedona shoot from
October. You need to go into the
office right this second. Pick up her
coffee order on the way. Write this
down."
88,3051,EMILY,88,Where are you?
89,3052,ANDY,89,I'm almost there.
90,3053,NIGEL,90,No...
91,3054,ANDY,91,Yes. She gave me the job.
92,3055,NIGEL,92,Clearly my opinion means nothing.
93,3056,NIGEL,93,"Nigel Kipling. Fashion Director. Let's
see what we're working with."
94,3057,NIGEL,94,"Wow. It's like Oklahoma and New Jersey
had a baby out of wedlock."
95,3058,ANDY,95,"Actually, I'm from Cincinnati."
96,3059,NIGEL,96,"No, it's not possible. Not you."
97,3060,NIGEL(CONT'D),97,"Welcome to the dollhouse, Baby."
98,3061,MIRANDA,98,"Is there a reason my coffee is not
here? Was I unclear in some way?"
99,3062,EMILY,99,"I hope you know this is a very
difficult job for which you are
totally wrong and if you mess up MY
head is on the chopping block."
100,3063,EMILY (CONT'D),100,"Okay, first of all, you and I answer
the phones. The phone MUST be answered
every single time it rings."
101,3064,EMILY (CONT'D),101,"Phones roll to voicemail, she gets
very upset. If I'm not here, you are
chained to this desk."
102,3065,ANDY,102,"What if the building's on fire or my
appendix explodes or something?"
103,3066,EMILY,103,"One time an assistant left the desk
because she sliced her hand open with
a letter opener. Miranda missed
Lagerfeld right before he boarded a 17
hour flight to Australia. She now
works at TV Guide."
104,3067,ANDY,104,Man the desk at all times. Got it.
105,3068,EMILY,105,"Miranda Priestly's office. She's not
available. I'll tell her you called.
Yet again."
106,3069,EMILY,106,"Remember, you and I have totally
different jobs. You run errands, you
get coffee, etcetera. I am in charge
of her schedule, her expenses, her
appointments. And, most importantly..."
107,3070,EMILY,107,"I get to go with her to Paris for
Fashion Week in the fall."
108,3071,EMILY (CONT'D),108,"I get to wear couture, go to all the
shows, all the parties, meet all the
designers. It's divine."
109,3072,EMILY (CONT'D),109,"Okay, stay here. I'm going to the art
department to give them the Book."
110,3073,EMILY (CONT'D),110,"The Book is a mock-up of everything in
the current issue. We deliver it to
Miranda's apartment every night and
she returns it in the morning with her
notes. The second assistant is
supposed to do it, but Miranda is very
private and doesn't like strangers
going to her house. So until she
decides you're not a psycho, I get the
lovely task of waiting around for the
Book."
111,3074,ANDY,111,How do I prove I'm not a psycho?
112,3075,EMILY,112,I have no idea.
113,3076,ANDY,113,Wait. What do I do if--
114,3077,ANDY (CONT'D),114,Oh no.
115,3078,ANDY (CONT'D),115,Mrs. Priestly's office.
116,3079,ANDY (CONT'D),116,"That's what I meant. Miranda
Priestly's office."
117,3080,ANDY (CONT'D),117,"She's in a meeting. Can I take
message? I'm sorry. Can you spell
Gabbana--"
118,3081,ANDY (CONT'D),118,Guess not.
119,3082,JOCELYN,119,"Run-through at 3, shoot 8 am tomorrow.
Of course. No problem."
120,3083,JOCELYN (CONT'D),120,"Who the hell does she think I am,
Houdini?"
121,3084,ANDY,121,"Hi, I'm Andy, I'm the new--"
122,3085,JOCELYN,122,"Great. Fantastic. If you'll excuse me,
I gotta go pull a bunch of fringe
purses out of my ass."
123,3086,NIGEL,123,I guessed 8 1/2.
124,3087,ANDY,124,"That's very nice of you, but I don't
need those. Miranda hired me. She
knows what I look like."
125,3088,NIGEL,125,Do you?
126,3089,MIRANDA,126,Emily!
127,3090,MIRANDA (CONT'D),127,Emily!
128,3091,NIGEL,128,She means you.
129,3092,NIGEL,129,Go.
130,3093,MIRANDA,130,"It's too dark. I can't see any of the
clothes..."
131,3094,PAUL,131,"...I think he intended to use shadow
to show the contours of the..."
132,3095,MIRANDA,132,"And what is this? I want the title of
the layout to bleed over the left side
of the photo..."
133,3096,PAUL,133,"I see, well, we needed room for the
typeface to pick up the lines of the
dress, which is cut on the bias, so
we..."
134,3097,MIRANDA,134,"No, no, no. That's not what I want. I
made that abundantly clear..."
135,3098,MIRANDA (CONT'D),135,"There you are, Emily. How many times
do I have to scream your name?"
136,3099,ANDY,136,"Actually, it's Andy."
137,3100,ANDY (CONT'D),137,"My name is Andy. Andrea, but people
call me Andy."
138,3101,MIRANDA,138,"What a fantastic story. So
entertaining and full of useful
information."
139,3102,MIRANDA (CONT'D),139,"I need ten or fifteen skirts from
Calvin Klein..."
140,3103,ANDY,140,What kind of--
141,3104,MIRANDA,141,"Please bore someone else with your
questions. Make sure we can get Pier
59 at 8 am tomorrow... Remind Jocelyn
I want to see a few of those satchels
Marc is doing in the pony... And tell
Simone I'll take Frankie if Maggie is
not available tomorrow... And did
Demarchelier confirm?"
142,3105,ANDY,142,Demar--
143,3106,MIRANDA,143,Get him on the phone.
144,3107,MIRANDA (CONT'D),144,And Emily.
145,3108,ANDY,145,Yes?
146,3109,MIRANDA,146,Do you have Demarchelier?
147,3110,ANDY,147,Demarchelier... Demarchelier...
148,3111,EMILY,148,I have Miranda Priestly calling.
149,3112,EMILY,149,I have Patrick.
150,3113,ANDY,150,"She called me in and asked me about
Pier 59. She said something about
Simone and Frankie and someone else.
And she needs skirts from Calvin
Klein. I think that's the most
important thing, but I couldn't tell.
Oh, and there was something about a
pony."
151,3114,EMILY,151,Did she say which skirts?
152,3115,EMILY,152,Did she say what kind?
153,3116,EMILY,153,Color? Shape? Fabric?
154,3117,ANDY,154,"I tried to ask her, but--"
155,3118,EMILY,155,You never ask Miranda. Anything.
156,3119,EMILY,156,"All right, I'll take care of the other
stuff. You go to Calvin Klein."
157,3120,ANDY,157,Me?
158,3121,EMILY,158,"I'm sorry. Do you have a prior
commitment? Is there some hideous
pants convention?"
159,3122,ANDY,159,"So I just, what, go down to the Calvin
Klein store and ask them--"
160,3123,EMILY,160,You're not going to the store.
161,3124,ANDY,161,"Of course not. I'm going... to his
house."
162,3125,EMILY,162,"You are catching on quickly. We always
send assistants to a designer's home
on their very first day. You're going
to his showroom. I'll give you the
address."
163,3126,ANDY,163,"Sorry. Got it. What's the nearest
subway stop?"
164,3127,EMILY,164,"Good God. You do not. Under any
circumstances. Take public
transportation."
165,3128,ROY,165,Miranda's new assistant. Congrats.
166,3129,ANDY,166,Thanks.
167,3130,ROY,167,You know--
168,3131,ANDY,168,"You're going to say a million girls
would kill for my job."
169,3132,ROY,169,"Actually, I was going to say those
Jelly Beans are seven years old."
170,3133,MIRANDA (O.S.),170,Are you there?
171,3134,ANDY,171,"I'm about to walk in. I'll call you as
soon as--"
172,3135,EMILY (O.S.),172,"While you're out... Miranda needs you
to go to Hermes and pick up twenty
five scarves we ordered for her.
Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton,
pick that up. And Miranda went out to
meet with Meisel, she'll want more
Starbucks when she gets back."
173,3136,LIZ,173,"You must be new. Congratulations.
People would KILL for your job. I
would. I love Miranda. She's such an
icon. I've dealt with her a couple
times, but I'm sure she doesn't
remember."
174,3137,EMILY,174,"Oh my God. What took you so long? I
have to pee."
175,3138,ANDY,175,You haven't peed since I left?
176,3139,EMILY,176,You do the coat.
177,3140,EMILY (CONT'D),177,"Now, be prepared. The run-through is
at 12:30 and people are panicking, so
the phone is going to be ringing off
the hook."
178,3141,ANDY,178,The run-through. Right.
179,3142,EMILY,179,"The editors bring in options for a
shoot and Miranda chooses. She chooses
every single thing in every single
issue. Run-throughs are a huge deal."
180,3143,ANDY,180,Is it always like this?
181,3144,EMILY,181,No. Sometimes it's busy.
182,3145,EMILY (CONT'D),182,"After the loo, Serena and I are going
to lunch."
183,3146,EMILY (CONT'D),183,This is her. The new me.
184,3147,EMILY (CONT'D),184,I told you.
185,3148,SERENA,185,I thought you were kidding.
186,3149,EMILY,186,"Oh, no. I was quite serious."
187,3150,EMILY (CONT'D),187,"I get twenty minutes for lunch, you
get fifteen. When I come back, you can
go."
188,3151,ANDY,188,You eat lunch?
189,3152,NIGEL,189,Corn chowder. Interesting choice.
190,3153,NIGEL (CONT'D),190,"You do know that cellulite is one of
the ingredients of corn chowder."
191,3154,ANDY,191,None of the girls here eat anything?
192,3155,NIGEL,192,"Not since 2 became the new 4 and 0
became the new 2."
193,3156,ANDY,193,I'm a 6.
194,3157,NIGEL,194,Which is the new 14.
195,3158,NIGEL (CONT'D),195,"Something tells me you've got more
polyblend where that came from."
196,3159,ANDY,196,"Okay. You think my clothes are
hideous. I get it, okay?"
197,3160,ANDY (CONT'D),197,"But I'm not going to be working in
fashion forever. I don't see any
reason to change everything about
myself because I have this job."
198,3161,NIGEL,198,"You're right. That's what this multi-
million dollar industry is all about.
Inner beauty."
199,3162,NIGEL (CONT'D),199,"Miranda wants us upstairs. Chairman's
on his way down to her office."
200,3163,NIGEL,200,Mr. Ravitz.
201,3164,IRV,201,Nigel.    Issue going well?
202,3165,NIGEL,202,Our biggest September ever.
203,3166,IRV,203,"Great. I heard Miranda killed Autumn
Jackets and pulled up the Sedona
shoot. What's that costing me?"
204,3167,NIGEL,204,"About 300,000."
205,3168,IRV,205,"Must have been some lousy Jackets.
But I'm sure she knows what she's
doing."
206,3169,NIGEL,206,Always.
207,3170,IRV,207,Irv Ravitz.
208,3171,NIGEL,208,"I'm sorry... this is Andy Sachs,
Miranda's new assistant."
209,3172,IRV,209,"Congratulations, young lady. A
million girls would kill for that job."
210,3173,NIGEL,210,"Chairman of Elias Clarke. You know
what they say, tiny man, huge ego."
211,3174,NIGEL,211,We should have taken the stairs.
212,3175,MIRANDA,212,"No... No... No... I swear I don't
understand why it's so difficult for
you to pull together a decent run-
through. You had hours to prepare..."
213,3176,MIRANDA,213,Where are all the advertisers?
214,3177,LUCIA,214,"We have some pieces from Banana
Republic and--"
215,3178,MIRANDA,215,We need more.
216,3179,MIRANDA (CONT'D),216,What do you think?
217,3180,NIGEL,217,"You know me. A full ballerina skirt
with a hint of saloon and I'm on
board."
218,3181,MIRANDA,218,Is it too much like the--
219,3182,NIGEL,219,"--LaCroix from July? I thought of
that, but with the right accessories,
it could work..."
220,3183,MIRANDA,220,Where are the belts for this skirt?
221,3184,JOCELYN,221,Tough call. They're so different.
222,3185,MIRANDA,222,Is something funny?
223,3186,ANDY,223,"No, no, no. It's just..."
224,3187,ANDY (CONT'D),224,"It's just that both of those belts
look the same to me. I'm still
learning about this stuff, so--"
225,3188,MIRANDA,225,"This... stuff? Okay. I understand. You
think this has nothing to do with you.
You go to your closet and select, say,
that lumpy blue sweater because you're
trying to tell the world that you take
yourself too seriously to care about
what's on your body. What you don't
know is that your sweater is not blue.
It's not even sky blue. It's cerulean.
You also don't know that in 2002, De
La Renta did a collection of cerulean
gowns, Yves St. Laurent showed a
cerulean military jacket, Dolce did
skirts with cerulean beads, and in our
September issue we did the definitive
layout on the color. Cerulean quickly
appeared in eight other major
collections, then the secondary and
department store lines and then
trickled down to some lovely Casual
Corner, where you no doubt stumbled on
it."
226,3189,MIRANDA (CONT'D),226,"That color is worth millions of
dollars and many jobs. And here you
are, thinking you've made a choice
that exempts you from the fashion
industry. In truth, you are wearing a
sweater that was selected for you by
the people in this room. From a pile
of stuff."
227,3190,MIRANDA (CONT'D),227,That's all.
228,3191,ANDY,228,"You should have seen the look she gave
me. I thought the flesh was going to
melt off her face."
229,3192,ANDY (CONT'D),229,"It's not funny. She could be the most
horrendous person I've ever met. She's
not happy unless everyone around her
is panicked, nauseous or suicidal. And
all the Clackers just WORSHIP her..."
230,3193,ANDY (CONT'D),230,"They call them Clackers. Their
stilettos in the marble lobby...
clack, clack, clack..."
231,3194,ANDY (CONT'D),231,"And they all act like they're curing
cancer or something. The amount of
time and energy they spend on things
that DON'T MATTER!!! Poring over these
minute details. And for what?"
232,3195,ANDY (CONT'D),232,"So tomorrow they can spend an extra
300,000 dollars reshooting something
that was probably fine to begin with?
To sell people things they don't need?"
233,3196,ANDY (CONT'D),233,"God, I'm not even hungry anymore.
Maybe that's why everyone there is so
skinny."
234,3197,NATE,234,"Gimme that. There's about eight
dollars worth of Jarlsberg in there."
235,3198,ANDY,235,"I just have to stick it out for one
year. Then I can do what I came to New
York to do. I can't let Miranda get to
me. I won't."
236,3199,NATE,236,"Easy, Killer."
237,3200,ANDY,237,And give me that sandwich.
238,3201,NATE,238,"Oh, no way. It's mine now."
239,3202,ANDY,239,"Good morning, Miranda!"
240,3203,MIRANDA,240,Get me Isaac.
241,3204,MIRANDA,241,These eggs are frigid.
242,3205,MIRANDA,242,"Pick up the Polaroids from the
swimwear shoot."
243,3206,MIRANDA,243,"The brakes in my car are making a
weird noise. Take it in."
244,3207,MIRANDA,244,"We need the hat from the finale of the
Zac Posen show."
245,3208,MIRANDA,245,"The girls need new boogieboards for
spring break."
246,3209,EMILY (V.O.),246,They also need flip flops.
247,3210,MIRANDA,247,Pick up my shoes from Manolo.
248,3211,MIRANDA,248,"...and while you're out, get Patricia."
249,3212,MIRANDA,249,Get me Isaac!
250,3213,ANDY,250,I have Isaac.
251,3214,ANDY (CONT'D),251,"Wow. Thank God it's Friday, huh?"
252,3215,ANDY (CONT'D),252,"My Dad's coming in from Ohio this
weekend. We're having dinner tonight.
Then we're seeing ""Chicago""..."
253,3216,ANDY (CONT'D),253,You doing anything fun this weekend?
254,3217,EMILY,254,Yes.
255,3218,ANDY,255,Dad! I'll be right down!
256,3219,RICHARD,256,"Here. Don't want you to get behind
in your rent."
257,3220,ANDY,257,How did you--
258,3221,ANDY,258,I'm gonna kill Mom. Thank you.
259,3222,ANDY (CONT'D),259,"It's so good to see you. You want
to start grilling me now or should
we wait until after dinner?"
260,3223,RICHARD,260,"Thought I'd let you at least enjoy
the bread basket first."
261,3224,ANDY,261,"Oh, just go ahead."
262,3225,RICHARD,262,"We're just a little worried. We get
emails from you at your office at 2
am, your pay is terrible, you don't
get to write anything..."
263,3226,ANDY,263,"Hey. Not fair. I wrote those e-
mails."
264,3227,RICHARD,264,"I'm just trying to understand why
someone who was accepted to
Stanford Law turns that down to be
a journalist and now you're not
even doing that--"
265,3228,ANDY,265,Oh please. Not this again.
266,3229,RICHARD,266,"Why did you even bother applying to
law school?"
267,3230,ANDY,267,"Because it's what you wanted. This is
what I want."
268,3231,RICHARD,268,This? Being a secretary?
269,3232,ANDY,269,I'm an executive assistant.
270,3233,RICHARD,270,"You hang coats, you go to Starbucks,
you're a secretary, Andy."
271,3234,ANDY,271,"You have to trust me. Being Miranda's
assistant opens a lot of doors. Emily
is going to Paris with Miranda in a
few months, she'll meet editors and
writers from every important magazine."
272,3235,ANDY (CONT'D),272,"Dad, I swear. This is my break. This
is my chance. This is my--"
273,3236,ANDY (CONT'D),273,-boss.
274,3237,ANDY (CONT'D),274,I have to get it.
275,3238,MIRANDA,275,"My flight is cancelled... Some absurd
weather problem."
276,3239,MIRANDA (CONT'D),276,"I have to get home. Tonight. The twins
have a recital at school tomorrow
morning."
277,3240,ANDY,277,"Absolutely, Miranda. Let me see what I
can do."
278,3241,ANDY (CONT'D),278,"I'm so sorry, Dad. I have to deal with
this."
279,3242,ANDY,279,I need a jet from Miami to New York...
280,3243,ANDY,280,"A jet, any kind of jet..."
281,3244,ANDY,281,"Yes, tonight, right now."
282,3245,ANDY,282,From Miami to New York.
283,3246,ANDY,283,"As soon as possible. Please call me
back as soon as the situation changes."
284,3247,ANDY,284,"I'm trying, Miranda. No one is flying
out because of the weather."
285,3248,MIRANDA,285,"Please. It's just drizzling. Someone
must be getting out. Call Donatella
and get her jet. Call everyone with a
jet -- Irv, Armani..."
286,3249,ANDY (O.S.),286,But--
287,3250,RICHARD,287,"Andy, come on. Let's go in."
288,3251,ANDY,288,"I've done everything I could think of.
I don't know what else to do."
289,3252,ANDY (CONT'D),289,"I'm sorry, Dad."
290,3253,ANDY (CONT'D),290,"Miranda, you don't understand. Even if
I get you a plane, they won't let you
take off tonight and--"
291,3254,MIRANDA,291,"Emily. Stop making excuses. GET ME
HOME."
292,3255,ANDY,292,Oh my God. She is going to murder me.
293,3256,RICHARD,293,Would it help if I talked to her?
294,3257,MIRANDA,294,"The girls' recital was wonderful. They
played Rachmaninoff and everyone loved
it. Except for me... because I was not
there."
295,3258,ANDY,295,"I'm so sorry, Miranda."
296,3259,MIRANDA,296,Do you know why I hired you?
297,3260,MIRANDA (CONT'D),297,"I always hire the same girl, stylish,
slender, worships the magazine. And
often they turn out to be
disappointing and stupid."
298,3261,MIRANDA (CONT'D),298,"But you, with your fancy resume and
your big speech about your so-called
work ethic-- I thought you would be
different. I thought, go ahead, take a
chance, hire the smart, fat girl."
299,3262,MIRANDA (CONT'D),299,"I had hope. I always have hope. But
you're as disappointing as anyone
else."
300,3263,ANDY,300,I did everything I could think of--
301,3264,MIRANDA,301,That's all.
302,3265,EMILY,302,"Excuse me, where do you think you--"
303,3266,ANDY,303,"She hates me, Nigel."
304,3267,NIGEL,304,"And that's my problem because -- wait,
no. Not my problem."
305,3268,ANDY,305,"I need your help. I don't know what to
do. It's like I'm completely beneath
her contempt."
306,3269,NIGEL,306,So quit.
307,3270,NIGEL (CONT'D),307,"We could replace you in five minutes.
With someone who really wants this
job."
308,3271,ANDY,308,"That's not fair. I'm lucky to be
working for Miranda -- I didn't get
that at first, but I do now. I want to
be here. But it just seems like no
matter how hard I try, I don't do
anything right."
309,3272,NIGEL,309,"Andy, please. Be serious. You're not
trying. You're whining."
310,3273,NIGEL (CONT'D),310,"You want me to say poor you, Miranda
is picking on you? She's just doing
her job. Wake up, Six. You're working
at the place that first published some
of the major artists of the century --
Halston, De La Renta, Lagerfeld. And
what they made is cooler than art,
because you live your life in it -- I
mean, not you, but some people. This
is not just a magazine. It's a shining
beacon of hope for, oh, I don't know,
say a young boy growing up in Rhode
Island with six brothers, pretending
to go to soccer practice when he was
actually at sewing class and reading
Runway at night under the covers with
a flashlight."
311,3274,NIGEL (CONT'D),311,"You have no idea how many legends have
walked these halls and what's worse,
you don't care. Because this is a
""stepping stone"" for you. This place,
that people would die to work, you
deign to work. And you want to know
why she doesn't give you a kiss on the
forehead and put a gold star on your
homework?"
312,3275,ANDY,312,"Okay, fine!"
313,3276,ANDY (CONT'D),313,"You're right. I'm screwing this up.
And I know this could be a big break
for me. I'm going to try harder, I
promise. But there's one thing I can't
do by myself."
314,3277,NIGEL,314,"Oh, no. No way..."
315,3278,ANDY,315,You do it with the other girls.
316,3279,NIGEL,316,"The other girls are different. They
really want it."
317,3280,ANDY,317,"Please, Nigel. Don't make me beg..."
318,3281,NIGEL,318,"I don't know what you expect me to do.
These are all sample sizes -- 2 and 4."
319,3282,ANDY,319,A... poncho?
320,3283,NIGEL,320,"You'll take what I give you and you'll
like it."
321,3284,NIGEL (CONT'D),321,"Versace peasant skirt -- we can pull
it up, belt it, make it a dress... Miu
Miu boyfriend cardigan... Alberta
Ferretti dress -- smocked, very
forgiving. And let's find you some
Chanel. You're in desperate need of
Chanel."
322,3285,NIGEL (CONT'D),322,"Don't just stand there. We have to get
you to the beauty department too. And
God knows how long that will take."
323,3286,EMILY,323,I have no idea why Miranda hired her.
324,3287,SERENA,324,"Me, neither. The other day we were in
the Beauty Department and she held up
the Shu Uemura eyelash curler and said
""What is this?"""
325,3288,EMILY,325,"I knew from the moment I saw her that
she was a complete and utter--"
326,3289,EMILY (CONT'D),326,--disaster.
327,3290,ANDY,327,"Miranda Priestly's office. She's not
in. I'll leave word."
328,3291,ANDY (CONT'D),328,"Can I help you, luv?"
329,3292,ANDY,329,What do you think?
330,3293,NATE,330,"I think we better get out of here
before my girlfriend sees me with you."
331,3294,ANDY,331,"Wanna lift, stranger?"
332,3295,MIRANDA,332,"The gowns are fabulous, Ralph. We're
using the burgundy for the cover try
and the lemon chiffon for the goddess
story."
333,3296,ANDY,333,"Bang & Olufsen. Charlie Rose sent it
to Miranda for her birthday."
334,3297,ANDY (CONT'D),334,"I looked it up online. It's 750
dollars. She doesn't want it, so Emily
told me to keep it. Oprah sent a
present. So did Jessica Simpson. And
Nelson Mandela."
335,3298,NATE,335,"All for a woman who doesn't need
anything. Perfect."
336,3299,ANDY,336,"Here... A bunch of Kiehl's, some Mason
Pearson hair brushes..."
337,3300,DOUG,337,"Dammit, I love your job."
338,3301,ANDY,338,"It's called ""Pink"". For women."
339,3302,DOUG,339,Men can be pink. I have a pink side.
340,3303,LILY,340,Please. We're eating.
341,3304,LILY (CONT'D),341,"Where did you get this? This is the
new Marc Jacobs, sold out everywhere.
It's nineteen hundred dollars. I can't
take this."
342,3305,ANDY,342,Sure you can.
343,3306,NATE,343,"Why do women need so many bags? You
get one, it holds all your junk,
aren't you done?"
344,3307,DOUG,344,"Fashion is not about utility, Nate. An
accessory is merely a piece of
iconography used to express individual
identity."
345,3308,LILY,345,And it's preeeetty.
346,3309,DOUG,346,That too.
347,3310,ANDY,347,"Thing is, it turns out there's a lot
more to Runway than fancy purses...
you know who's coming into the office
Friday? John Updike."
348,3311,NATE,348,"Why, does he need a sweater?"
349,3312,ANDY,349,"Look, there's a piece by Jay
McInerney, an essay by Joan Didion, an
interview with Christiane Amanpour
oh..."
350,3313,NATE,350,Look who's drinking the KoolAid.
351,3314,ANDY,351,Give me the phone.
352,3315,NATE,352,"Oh, look. The Dragon Lady. Of course."
353,3316,ANDY,353,Give me the phone.
354,3317,LILY,354,"I'll talk to her. Tell her she needs
to get her own scrambled eggs."
355,3318,ANDY,355,"Come on, guys. Give me the phone!"
356,3319,ANDY (CONT'D),356,"Hello, Miranda."
357,3320,ANDY (CONT'D),357,"Fine. No problem. I'm leaving right
now."
358,3321,ANDY (CONT'D),358,"You guys didn't need to be such
assholes."
359,3322,ANDY,359,I'm looking for James Holt...
360,3323,ANDY (CONT'D),360,"Hi, I'm Andy. I'm picking up for
Miranda Priestly."
361,3324,JAMES,361,You must be the new Emily. Let me see.
362,3325,JAMES (CONT'D),362,"Open-woven leather, pieced by hand and
finished with a suede trim. Who made
this fantastic thing?"
363,3326,ANDY,363,You.
364,3327,JAMES,364,Duh.
365,3328,JAMES (CONT'D),365,"It's a sketch of Miranda's dress for
the benefit, the centerpiece of my
spring collection. Top secret stuff."
366,3329,ANDY,366,I'll guard it with my life.
367,3330,JAMES,367,"Come on. You work for Miranda, you
must be in desperate need of hard
liquor."
368,3331,JAMES (CONT'D),368,She'll have the punch.
369,3332,JAMES (CONT'D),369,It's deadly. Have fun!
370,3333,CHRISTIAN,370,"He's right. I had the punch at James's
last party, woke up in Hoboken wearing
nothing but boxers and a cowboy hat."
371,3334,ANDY,371,"Hi. I, um... I have to go."
372,3335,CHRISTIAN,372,"But you want to stay. You've never
been to a party like this."
373,3336,ANDY,373,"God, I love it when total strangers
tell me how I feel."
374,3337,CHRISTIAN,374,That's my way.
375,3338,CHRISTIAN,375,Christian Thompson.
376,3339,ANDY,376,"Christian Thompson? You're kidding.
You write for every magazine I love. I
actually reviewed your collection of
essays for my college paper."
377,3340,CHRISTIAN,377,"Did you mention my good looks and
killer charm?"
378,3341,ANDY,378,"No, but I did point out some factual
errors and a penchant for
confessional semi-fiction that borders
on self-indulgent."
379,3342,CHRISTIAN,379,You and the Times.
380,3343,CHRISTIAN,380,And what do you do?
381,3344,ANDY,381,"Well, I want to work somewhere like
the New Yorker or Vanity Fair. I'm
also a writer, but--"
382,3345,CHRISTIAN,382,"Is that right? I should read your
stuff. Send it over."
383,3346,ANDY,383,"Thank you. That would be great.
Anyway, for now I'm Miranda Priestly's
assistant."
384,3347,CHRISTIAN,384,"You're kidding. Oh, that's too bad.
You'll never survive Miranda."
385,3348,ANDY,385,Excuse me?
386,3349,CHRISTIAN,386,"You're smart, you're nice, you have a
point of view. You can't do that job."
387,3350,ANDY,387,I have to go.
388,3351,CHRISTIAN,388,"Let me guess. You have a boyfriend
waiting. From... not high school...
college? Nice-looking guy, devoted,
about to ask you to move in with him,
but you're not sure..."
389,3352,ANDY,389,You. Are not a nice person.
390,3353,CHRISTIAN,390,"Nice to meet you, Miranda girl."
391,3354,ANDY,391,"For your information, he's really
handsome. And we already live
together!"
392,3355,NATE,392,"You got the nuclear briefcase from the
undisclosed location. I'm proud of
you."
393,3356,ANDY,393,Where are you going?
394,3357,NATE,394,"Doug and some of his banker buddies
are playing Texas Hold `Em at his
apartment. Gonna go get me some of
that Wall Street cash."
395,3358,ANDY,395,But I came back so we could hang out.
396,3359,NATE,396,"Man, I'm sorry. You didn't make that
crystal clear when you stormed off
after calling me an asshole."
397,3360,ANDY,397,"Okay, look, I'm sorry about that--"
398,3361,NATE,398,"I'll see you later, okay?"
399,3362,NATE (CONT'D),399,Hello?
400,3363,NATE (CONT'D),400,"Sure, Doug! I'll get on it ASAP! A six-
pack? No problem. Budweiser or
Michelob? Chilled? Of course..."
401,3364,MIRANDA,401,Emily!
402,3365,JAMES (CONT'D),402,You got the sketches for your dress.
403,3366,MIRANDA,403,Yes. I did.
404,3367,MIRANDA (CONT'D),404,Thank you.
405,3368,JAMES,405,"This season I started to think about
the intersection of East and West..."
406,3369,JAMES (CONT'D),406,"I didn't want to do, say, a blonde in
a kimono. It's more about capturing
the Eastern sensibility in the Western
woman. Kind of Uma Thurman in Kill
Bill in a kick ass dress with an obi
belt. The modern woman as Geisha meets
rock star, with a little Desperate
Housewives thrown in."
407,3370,JAMES (CONT'D),407,"And this, of course, is the dress
we're making for you."
408,3371,JAMES (CONT'D),408,"A lush Asian fabric, tailored, but
with a bit of movement to work against
the modernism."
409,3372,ANDY,409,"She pursed her lips and because of
that he's going to change his entire
collection?"
410,3373,NIGEL,410,"You still don't get it, do you? Her
opinion is the only one that matters."
411,3374,MIRANDA,411,Make sure you confirm my dinner with--
412,3375,ANDY,412,--Galliano at Pastis. Done.
413,3376,MIRANDA,413,"And I need to see the look book for
the November denim shoot."
414,3377,ANDY,414,It's in the car.
415,3378,MIRANDA,415,Fine.
416,3379,MIRANDA (CONT'D),416,"Oh, and you'll be bringing The Book to
my home tonight. Emily will give you
the key, Andrea."
417,3380,EMILY,417,Guard this with your life.
418,3381,ANDY,418,"Of course. If I can deliver the Book,
that means I must have done something
right, that she doesn't think I'm
psycho. Oh, and she actually called me
Andrea instead of Emily. Isn't that
great?"
419,3382,EMILY,419,"Yeah. Whoopee. Okay, now, it's very
important that you do EXACTLY what I'm
about to tell you."
420,3383,EMILY (V.O.),420,"The Book is assembled by 10 or 10:30,
so you must wait around until then."
421,3384,INTERCOM,421,Book's ready!
422,3385,EMILY (V.O.),422,"You'll be delivering Miranda's dry
cleaning with the book."
423,3386,EMILY (V.O.),423,"The driver will take you to Miranda's
townhouse."
424,3387,EMILY (V.O.),424,Let yourself in.
425,3388,EMILY,425,"Do not talk to anyone. Do not look at
anyone. That is of the utmost
importance. You must be invisible. Do
you understand?"
426,3389,EMILY (V.O.),426,"Open the door, walk across the foyer,
then hang the dry cleaning in the
closet across from the staircase."
427,3390,EMILY (V.O.) (CONT'D),427,"And leave the Book on the table with
the flowers."
428,3391,ANDY,428,Shit.
429,3392,CASSIDY,429,It's that door. On the left.
430,3393,CAROLINE,430,You can give us the Book.
431,3394,CASSIDY,431,We'll give it to her.
432,3395,CAROLINE,432,It's okay. Come on up.
433,3396,ANDY,433,But I can't... Shh...
434,3397,CASSIDY,434,It's okay.
435,3398,MIRANDA,435,"What did you want me to do? Walk out
in the middle of a photo shoot?"
436,3399,STEPHEN,436,"I rushed out of an investment
committee meeting early, then I sat
there waiting for you for almost an
hour..."
437,3400,MIRANDA,437,"We were in a loft near the Seaport. My
phone didn't work. I told you."
438,3401,STEPHEN,438,"...and I knew what everyone in the
restaurant was thinking. There he is,
waiting for HER again--"
439,3402,ANDY,439,"Okay, before you start freaking out,
it wasn't such a big deal. The twins
said hello, I said hello back, then I
went upstairs and gave the book to
Miranda--"
440,3403,EMILY,440,"You went upstairs? Oh my God. Why
didn't you just climb into bed with
her and ask for a bedtime story?"
441,3404,ANDY,441,You're right. I made a mistake.
442,3405,EMILY,442,"Don't you understand? If you get
fired, that might jeopardize Paris for
me. And if that happens, I will search
every Blimpie's in the tri-state area
until I find you and kill you."
443,3406,ANDY,443,Wait a second. She's going to fire me?
444,3407,EMILY,444,I don't know. She's not happy.
445,3408,MIRANDA,445,An-dre-a.
446,3409,ANDY,446,"Miranda, about last night, I--"
447,3410,MIRANDA,447,"I need the new Harry Potter book for
the twins."
448,3411,ANDY,448,"Of course. I'll run down to Barnes &
Noble right now."
449,3412,MIRANDA,449,"Did you fall down and smack your
little head on the pavement?"
450,3413,ANDY,450,Not that I can recall.
451,3414,MIRANDA,451,"We have all the published Harry Potter
books. The girls want to know what
happens next."
452,3415,ANDY,452,"So you want the... unpublished
manuscript."
453,3416,MIRANDA,453,"We know everyone in publishing.
Shouldn't be a problem."
454,3417,MIRANDA,454,"You can do anything, right?"
455,3418,ANDY,455,"She doesn't get it. There's no way I
can get that book. I don't care who I
call."
456,3419,MIRANDA,456,"My girls are leaving on the train to
their Grandmother's at 3. They'll need
the book by then."
457,3420,ANDY,457,Of course.
458,3421,MIRANDA,458,I'd like my steak in fifteen minutes.
459,3422,ANDY,459,No problem.
460,3423,ANDY (CONT'D),460,"Great. I have to get the impossible
manuscript in four hours. And Smith
and Wollensky's doesn't open until
11:30. How am I supposed to get the
steak?"
461,3424,ANDY (CONT'D),461,"She's going to fire me, isn't she?
She's just prolonging the kill. Like
an evil cat with a tiny unfashionable
mouse."
462,3425,EMILY,462,"Oh look, you're getting paranoid. Yay.
It's not just me. Listen, don't freak
out. There could be a silver lining
here."
463,3426,EMILY (CONT'D),463,"When Miranda gives someone an
impossible task, it generally means
one of two things. One, she thinks you
can actually pull it off."
464,3427,ANDY,464,Or--
465,3428,EMILY,465,"Or, you know, that thing you were
saying about the cat."
466,3429,ANDY,466,"It's for Miranda Priestly... it's very
important. Yes, I know, it's
impossible to get..."
467,3430,ANDY,467,"Anything? Can you try again? I would
really appreciate any leads at all...
thanks. No pressure. If I don't have
it by 3, I'm fired."
468,3431,MARTY,468,"What an amazing job, working for
someone like Ms. Priestly."
469,3432,ANDY,469,Yeah. It's a real party.
470,3433,ANDY (O.S.),470,"You probably don't remember me. We met
at James Holt's party and I work for
Miranda Priestly and--"
471,3434,CHRISTIAN,471,"Of course I remember you, Miranda
Girl. You shaken off the college
boyfriend yet?"
472,3435,ANDY,472,"Listen. I desperately need a favor.
And I don't know many people in the
book world..."
473,3436,CHRISTIAN,473,"The Harry Potter manuscript? You've
gotta be kidding."
474,3437,ANDY (O.S.),474,I'm sorry to ask you. I'm desperate.
475,3438,CHRISTIAN,475,"Just tell her it can't be done. You'll
have to come up with a plan B."
476,3439,ANDY,476,"We're talking about Miranda Priestly.
There is no plan B, only plan A."
477,3440,ANDY,477,Is she back? Am I fired?
478,3441,EMILY,478,"You know, I rarely say this to people
who aren't me, but you need to calm
down."
479,3442,MIRANDA,479,"What is that doing here? I ordered it
ages ago."
480,3443,MIRANDA (CONT'D),480,"Luckily, before I starved to death,
Irv invited me to lunch.
(re: steak)
Get rid of that. I'll be back at 3.
Please have my Starbucks order
waiting."
481,3444,MIRANDA (CONT'D),481,"And if you don't have the Harry Potter
book by then, don't come back."
482,3445,ANDY,482,"(on the cell phone)
Harry Potter.
(jump cut)
The manuscript.
(jump cut)
It's for Miranda Priestly.
(jump cut to)
I need it today.
(to the BARRISTA)
Can you make it extra hot? Like,
center of the sun hot?"
483,3446,ANDY (CONT'D),483,"Sorry, my boss is particular.
(into phone)
Are you sure? You're my last shot.
(sighs)
All right, well, thanks for trying."
484,3447,BARRISTA,484,Sounds like a great job.
485,3448,ANDY,485,"Actually, it is. A million girls would
kill for it."
486,3449,ANDY,486,Want a mocha?
487,3450,NATE,487,Quit? Are you sure?
488,3451,ANDY,488,"I failed. She's going to fire me
anyway. Might as well beat her to the
punch."
489,3452,NATE,489,"Wow. Good for you. Congratulations,
Andy. You're free."
490,3453,ANDY,490,Call you later.
491,3454,ANDY (CONT'D),491,Hello?
492,3455,CHRISTIAN (O.S.),492,"I'm brilliant. Really. Monuments
should be erected in my honor."
493,3456,ANDY,493,You didn't.
494,3457,CHRISTIAN,494,"Oh yes. A friend of a friend does the
cover art. She has the manuscript."
495,3458,ANDY,495,"No. That would mean I actually... did
something right."
496,3459,ANDY,496,"But see... thing is... See, I was
about to..."
497,3460,CHRISTIAN,497,"You want this, you better hurry. Meet
me at the St. Regis."
498,3461,ST. REGIS BUTLER,498,"Welcome to the St. Regis. Is there
anything I can assist you with?"
499,3462,ANDY,499,"Yes, I'm meeting someone..."
500,3463,ST. REGIS BUTLER,500,Right this way.
501,3464,CHRISTIAN,501,You have one hour.
502,3465,ANDY,502,"I'm begging you. You have to stall
her. Just ten minutes."
503,3466,HENRY,503,"Too much traffic on 5th. UN's in
session."
504,3467,ANDY,504,"(brightly)
Anything else I can do for you?"
505,3468,NATE,505,"I went over to Dean & DeLuca -- man,
they charge like five bucks a
strawberry, but I figured, you quit,
we should celebrate."
506,3469,ANDY,506,"Listen, Nate--"
507,3470,NATE,507,"So you quit, but you're still doing
the twins' science project. Big of
you."
508,3471,ANDY,508,"After I called you, I realized... It
doesn't make sense to throw away all
these months of hard work. I just had
a moment of weakness. That's all."
509,3472,NATE,509,"Either that or your job sucks and your
boss is a wacko."
510,3473,NATE (CONT'D),510,Okay. Whatever. It's your job.
511,3474,ANDY,511,"That's all it is, Nate. Just a job."
512,3475,NATE,512,"No, no. It's an important magazine.
That's what you said, right?"
513,3476,NATE (CONT'D),513,"Let's see... How to buy a custom-made
600 dollar bra. That's important. A
list of the 10 best wrinkle creams
under $500. That's important."
514,3477,ANDY,514,"I get the point, Nate."
515,3478,NATE,515,"The new Botox. The new pea coat. The
new"
516,3479,NATE,516,Gstaad. What the hell is--
517,3480,ANDY,517,"Gstaad. It's a ski resort. In
Switzerland."
518,3481,NATE,518,"See? I now live with someone who knows
that. Thank you, Miranda Priestly."
519,3482,ANDY,519,"Nate, it's not like I run the
magazine. I just work there, remember?"
520,3483,ANDY (CONT'D),520,"I'm the same person I was. I still
want the same things."
521,3484,ANDY (CONT'D),521,"I promise. Same Andy, better clothes."
522,3485,NATE,522,"That's the thing -- I liked your old
clothes."
523,3486,ANDY,523,"What about these? These are pretty
nice."
524,3487,ANDY (CONT'D),524,And this skirt?
525,3488,ANDY (CONT'D),525,Okay. What about this?
526,3489,NATE,526,I like that.
527,3490,NIGEL,527,"...Posen's doing some very sculptural
suits, so Testino wants to shoot them
at the Noguchi Garden in the Chase
building."
528,3491,MIRANDA,528,"Perfect. What about the accessories
pages for April?"
529,3492,JOCELYN,529,"One thought was enamel -- bangles,
pendants, earrings--"
530,3493,MIRANDA,530,We did that two years ago. What else?
531,3494,JOCELYN,531,"Well, they're showing a lot of florals
for spring and so--"
532,3495,MIRANDA (CONT'D),532,"Anyone have anything I can actually
use?"
533,3496,ANDY,533,Are you okay?
534,3497,EMILY,534,"Tonight's the benefit. I've been
looking forward to it for MONTHS. I
refuse to be sick. I'm wearing
Valentino."
535,3498,EMILY,535,"Everyone's going to be leaving to get
dressed soon, so after you drop off
Miranda's Fendi bag at the re-beaders,
you can just go home."
536,3499,ANDY,536,"Great. Thanks. That's perfect, because
I need to get to Magnolia Bakery
before they close..."
537,3500,ANDY (CONT'D),537,"...it's Nate's birthday and we're
having a little party for him--"
538,3501,ANDY (CONT'D),538,"Anyway, have fun tonight."
539,3502,MIRANDA,539,"I want to make sure before the benefit
that you are both fully prepped on the
guest list."
540,3503,ANDY,540,"Um... I thought only the first
assistant went to the benefit."
541,3504,MIRANDA,541,"Only when the first assistant hasn't
decided to be disgustingly ill. You'll
come and help Emily."
542,3505,EMILY,542,I don't see why she needs both of us.
543,3506,ANDY,543,"Don't look at me. This is the last
thing I want to do."
544,3507,EMILY,544,"These are all the guests. Miranda
invites everyone. We have to make sure
they all think she knows exactly who
they are. I've been studying for
weeks."
545,3508,ANDY,545,"I need to learn all these people by
tonight?"
546,3509,EMILY,546,Don't be silly.
547,3510,EMILY (CONT'D),547,You have to learn these too.
548,3511,ANDY,548,"Lily, just start without me. I'll be
there as soon as I can."
549,3512,LILY,549,"Okay, but hurry."
550,3513,ANDY,550,"I will. I promise. Believe me, this is
the last thing I want to--"
551,3514,ANDY (CONT'D),551,"Oh, I love that."
552,3515,ANDY (CONT'D),552,I'll call you the second I'm leaving.
553,3516,ANDY (CONT'D),553,Will that fit me?
554,3517,NIGEL,554,"Of course. A few extra yards of fabric
and a staple gun and we're in
business."
555,3518,NIGEL,555,"Remember, there are two keys to
wearing an evening gown -- one is to
maintain a regal bearing. The second--"
556,3519,NIGEL (CONT'D),556,Make sure the girls face forward.
557,3520,NIGEL (CONT'D),557,Not bad. How do you feel?
558,3521,ANDY (V.O.),558,"Let's see. My feet are killing me,
everything pinches..."
559,3522,ANDY (V.O.),559,"...my breasts are squeezed into a ball
and this hairpiece is like having a
boulder pinned to my head..."
560,3523,ANDY (V.O.) (CONT'D),560,Never felt better.
561,3524,NIGEL,561,"...this benefit is the social event of
the season. It represents what Runway
is about -- grace, style, elegance..."
562,3525,EMILY,562,"Oh my God, Andy. You look... chic."
563,3526,ANDY,563,And you look... so thin.
564,3527,EMILY,564,"Do I? It's for Paris. I'm on a new
diet. I don't eat anything, and then,
when I feel like I'm about to faint, I
eat a cube of cheese."
565,3528,ANDY,565,It's definitely working.
566,3529,EMILY,566,"I know. I'm just one stomach flu away
from my goal weight."
567,3530,ANDY,567,That's... great.
568,3531,EMILY,568,Ready?
569,3532,EMILY,569,"We need to make sure we're there the
second she walks in."
570,3533,ANDY,570,"I was wondering how long you think
we'll have to stay because I was
hoping to--"
571,3534,EMILY,571,There she is.
572,3535,EMILY (CONT'D),572,"John Folger. New artistic director,
Circle in the Square."
573,3536,MIRANDA,573,John. Good to see you.
574,3537,ANDY,574,"That's Massimo Cortileono, chairman of-"
575,3538,EMILY,575,She knows him.
576,3539,MIRANDA,576,"Massimo, you made it. I was worried
you'd be too busy with your new
factory in Ortezzano--"
577,3540,MASSIMO,577,"I would never miss a chance to see
you, Miranda, darling."
578,3541,MIRANDA,578,"(smiling)
Emily?"
579,3542,EMILY,579,"(fumbling)
That's... Wait... I know who that
is... It's..."
580,3543,ANDY,580,"Ambassador Franklin. And that's the
woman he left his wife for, Rebecca.
The woman he's leaving HER for is the
man walking down the stairs in
Valentino."
581,3544,MIRANDA,581,"Ambassador, Rebecca."
582,3545,EMILY,582,Thanks.
583,3546,ANDY,583,(trying to remember what
584,3547,ANDY,584,"That's... Jacqueline Follet, right?
From French Runway."
585,3548,EMILY,585,"Yes. Oh my God. Miranda hates her. She
was supposed to arrive after Miranda
left..."
586,3549,MIRANDA,586,"Ah, Bonsoir, Cherie. Ta robe est
rudement chouette."
587,3550,JACQUELINE,587,"I like your dress too. Very...
Americaine. Sportif."
588,3551,MIRANDA,588,"Thank you for coming to our little get
together tonight."
589,3552,JACQUELINE,589,"Of course. I plan my whole year around
it."
590,3553,MIRANDA,590,And we're all so grateful.
591,3554,JACQUELINE,591,"After all, we're family, no?"
592,3555,ANDY,592,"Alors, Jacqueline, ditez-moi, avez-
vous rencontré Brad Pitt?"
593,3556,JACQUELINE,593,"Ah, no... Pas encore..."
594,3557,EMILY,594,You can go. I've got it from here.
595,3558,ANDY,595,Are you sure?
596,3559,EMILY,596,Go. Have fun.
597,3560,ANDY,597,"(amazed)
Thank you. Thank you so much."
598,3561,MIRANDA,598,"Darling, there you are."
599,3562,STEPHEN,599,"It's a banner evening. Three people
have failed to recognize me, one
person called me Mr. Priestly, and now
the damned bartender refuses to serve
me."
600,3563,STEPHEN (CONT'D),600,"Why don't you get me a drink? He's
gotta listen to you, right, little
guy?"
601,3564,ANDY,601,"I'm sorry to bother you, but I've been
dying to ask you... Is it true that
John Cheever used to ghostwrite the
editor's page of Manhattan Magazine in
the 50's?..."
602,3565,MIRANDA,602,"Come on, darling, let's get something
to eat. I'm starved, aren't you?"
603,3566,CHRISTIAN,603,"Look at you... you're a vision. Thank
God I saved your job."
604,3567,ANDY,604,"Hey, I figured out a few things on my
own, too. Turns out I'm not as nice as
you thought."
605,3568,CHRISTIAN,605,God I hope not.
606,3569,CHRISTIAN (CONT'D),606,"If you didn't have that stupid
boyfriend, I'd have to whisk you away
right here and now."
607,3570,ANDY,607,"Do you really say things like that to
people?"
608,3571,CHRISTIAN,608,Evidently.
609,3572,ANDY,609,I have to go...
610,3573,CHRISTIAN,610,"Are you sure? My editor from Vanity
Fair is in there and I was going to
introduce you to him.
(off her look, surprised)
You sent me your stuff, remember? I
have to be honest, I only read a
couple -- that was quite a big packet -
- but they weren't half-bad. You're
pretty talented, Andy. He should meet
you. Come on in. Just one drink."
611,3574,ANDY,611,"Well, maybe I could--
(quickly)
No no no. I can't. I just can't."
612,3575,CHRISTIAN,612,Say hello to the boyfriend for me.
613,3576,ANDY,613,"I don't understand what's so difficult
about scheduling a preview. If you
want Miranda to give you any
editorial, we'll need to see the
clothing at least three weeks before
the show. Yes, please. See what you
can do."
614,3577,EMILY,614,Everything okay?
615,3578,ANDY,615,Yeah. I'm... fine.
616,3579,ANDY (CONT'D),616,Miranda Priestly's office. Thanks.
617,3580,ANDY (CONT'D),617,"I gotta go pick up the Polaroids from
the shoot."
618,3581,JOCELYN,618,"No, no, no. I think Gisele should be
the lizard and Vivian the donkey."
619,3582,NIGEL,619,The lizard's better with the Dolce.
620,3583,NIGEL,620,"Sometimes I can't believe I talk about
this crap all day."
621,3584,MIRANDA,621,Don't forget to tell Emily.
622,3585,ANDY (O.S.),622,Emily--
623,3586,EMILY,623,"Sorry I'm late. Miranda wanted some
scarves from Hermes and she told me
yesterday but I forgot and so--"
624,3587,ANDY (O.S.),624,"Emily, I have to talk to you."
625,3588,EMILY,625,"I freaked out of course, but then I
just called Martine at home and she
opened the store early, so I got them."
626,3589,ANDY,626,"Okay. Emily. When you get in, I want
to talk to you about something--"
627,3590,EMILY,627,"I hope it's not another Miranda
problem--"
628,3591,ANDY,628,Not exactly.
629,3592,EMILY,629,"Good. Because I've got so much to deal
with before I go, I swear to God I
can't even--"
630,3593,EMILY,630,"I don't care if she was going to fire
you or beat you with a red hot poker,
you should have said no."
631,3594,ANDY,631,"I didn't have a choice. You know how
she is."
632,3595,EMILY,632,"Oh, please. That's a pathetic excuse."
633,3596,EMILY (CONT'D),633,"What gets me about this whole thing
is, you're the one who pretends you
don't care about this stuff. You don't
care about fashion, you just want to
be a journalist, blah, blah, blah.
What a load of bollocks."
634,3597,ANDY,634,"Look, I know you're mad. And I don't
blame you."
635,3598,EMILY,635,"Face it, Andy. You sold your soul the
day you put on your first pair of
Jimmy Choos."
636,3599,EMILY (CONT'D),636,"And you know what really kills me? The
clothes you're about to get. You don't
deserve them. You eat carbs, for
Christ's sake. It's so unfair."
637,3600,EMILY (CONT'D),637,Just go.
638,3601,ANDY,638,Emily--
639,3602,EMILY,639,"I said, go!"
640,3603,DOUG,640,"You're going to Paris for the couture
shows? That's the coolest fashion
event of the year -- who are you going
to see Galliano? Lagerfeld? Nicolas
Ghesquiere?"
641,3604,ANDY,641,"Okay, now you're scaring me."
642,3605,ANDY (CONT'D),642,"Lily, this show is amazing. I am so
proud of you."
643,3606,LILY,643,"I wasn't sure you would be able to
make it."
644,3607,ANDY,644,"What are you talking about? I wouldn't
miss this."
645,3608,ANDY (cont'd) (CONT'D),645,"Okay, so lately I've missed a few
things... a lot of things... almost
everything."
646,3609,LILY,646,"I'm just glad you're here. Start with
the murals in the other room. They're
amazing..."
647,3610,CHRISTIAN (CONT'D),647,I was just thinking about you.
648,3611,ANDY,648,Come on.
649,3612,CHRISTIAN,649,"It's true. I'm profiling Gaultier for
Interview and I was making plans for
Paris and found myself wondering if
you would be there."
650,3613,ANDY,650,Actually...
651,3614,ANDY (cont'd) (CONT'D),651,I am going--
652,3615,CHRISTIAN,652,"That's great. I'm staying at a
fantastic little hotel in the Seventh
across the street from a falafel
restaurant that will change your life."
653,3616,ANDY,653,"Sorry. I'll be too busy working.
You'll have to find someone else's
life to change."
654,3617,CHRISTIAN,654,"But that's just it. I'm starting to
wonder if I can."
655,3618,ANDY,655,"Miranda asked me and I couldn't say
no, okay? I didn't have a choice."
656,3619,NATE,656,"I know, I know. That's your answer for
everything lately. I didn't have a
choice. Like this job was forced on
you. Like you don't make these
decisions yourself..."
657,3620,ANDY,657,"Okay. I get it, you're mad because I
work late all the time, because I
missed your birthday party--"
658,3621,NATE,658,"Oh, come on. What am I, four?"
659,3622,ANDY,659,"You hate Runway. And Miranda. You
think fashion is stupid. You've made
that clear."
660,3623,NATE,660,"Andy, I make port wine reductions all
day. I'm not exactly in the Peace
Corps. I wouldn't care if you were out
all night pole dancing if you did it
with some integrity."
661,3624,ANDY,661,So now I have no integrity. Great.
662,3625,NATE,662,"You used to say this was just a job.
You made fun of the Runway girls. And
now you've become one of them."
663,3626,ANDY,663,That's absurd.
664,3627,NATE,664,"Look at you. Now that I know how much
you're willing to change to be
successful, it makes me wonder if we
ever had anything in common."
665,3628,ANDY,665,You don't mean that.
666,3629,NATE,666,I do. I really do.
667,3630,ANDY,667,"Then maybe this trip is coming at a
good time. Maybe we should take a
break."
668,3631,ANDY (CONT'D),668,Nate!
669,3632,NATE,669,"In case you're wondering, the person
whose calls you always take, that's
the relationship you're in."
670,3633,NATE (CONT'D),670,"I hope you two are very happy
together."
671,3634,ANDY,671,"Hello, Miranda..."
672,3635,ANDY,672,"Wait. This is not right. Miranda is
staying in the suite."
673,3636,BELLMAN,673,"That's correct, Mademoiselle. Miranda
Priestly's suite is down the hall."
674,3637,ANDY,674,This is my room?
675,3638,CHRISTIAN,675,"You know, I've been thinking, and you
still owe me for Harry Potter."
676,3639,ANDY,676,"Oh, do I?"
677,3640,CHRISTIAN,677,Of course you do. You working tonight?
678,3641,ANDY,678,"Actually, Miranda has a dinner."
679,3642,CHRISTIAN,679,"So you're free. Perfect. Oh, but
there's a problem, huh? Le Boyfriend."
680,3643,CHRISTIAN (CONT'D),680,"Wait. Don't tell me, The boyfriend is
non plus? Je suis trés trés desolé."
681,3644,ANDY,681,"Oh, you're so full of it. You are not
desolé at all."
682,3645,CHRISTIAN,682,"Yeah, not even a little. What time
should I pick you up?"
683,3646,MIRANDA,683,"There you are. We need to go over the
seating chart for the luncheon."
684,3647,ANDY,684,"Sure. No problem. I have it right
here, um..."
685,3648,MIRANDA,685,"By all means, move at a glacial pace.
You know how that thrills me."
686,3649,MIRANDA (CONT'D),686,"Okay, so, first of all, let's put Jay-
Z at my table."
687,3650,ANDY,687,But your table is full.
688,3651,MIRANDA,688,Stephen won't be coming.
689,3652,ANDY,689,"So Stephen is not... so you don't need
me to fetch Stephen from the airport
tomorrow?"
690,3653,MIRANDA,690,"Well, if you speak to him and he
decides to rethink the divorce, then
""fetch"" him. Fetch away."
691,3654,MIRANDA (CONT'D),691,"When we get back to New York, we'll
need to think of a way to keep it out
of the press."
692,3655,ANDY,692,Of course.
693,3656,MIRANDA,693,"Another divorce in the papers... and
we all know what they'll say about me -
- Dragon Lady, career-obsessed, drove
away another ""Mr. Priestly""."
694,3657,MIRANDA (CONT'D),694,"He knew who I was, you know. They all
did. And at first they're always proud
to be with a powerful, accomplished
woman. That's what they say. But
then..."
695,3658,MIRANDA (CONT'D),695,"I don't care what anyone says about
me, of course. But it's so unfair to
the girls... another disappointment,
another stepfather, gone..."
696,3659,MIRANDA (CONT'D),696,"I mean, the point is--"
697,3660,MIRANDA (CONT'D),697,"We really need to figure out where to
put Donatella because she's barely
speaking to anyone."
698,3661,ANDY,698,"Miranda, I'm so sorry. If you want me
to cancel your evening, I can."
699,3662,MIRANDA,699,"Don't be ridiculous... why would you
do that?"
700,3663,ANDY,700,"Miranda, is there... is there anything
else I can do?"
701,3664,MIRANDA,701,Your job.
702,3665,MIRANDA,702,Go.
703,3666,NIGEL,703,"Hi. Listen, I need Miranda's itinerary
because--"
704,3667,NIGEL (CONT'D),704,Who put that together for you?
705,3668,ANDY,705,What do you mean?
706,3669,NIGEL,706,That outfit.
707,3670,ANDY,707,"Oh, I just threw it on."
708,3671,NIGEL,708,"Incredible. Well, I guess my work here
really is done. Come on. Let's have
champagne. We're celebrating."
709,3672,ANDY,709,What are we toasting?
710,3673,CHRISTIAN,710,"That's fantastic. Can we stop talking
about her now?"
711,3674,ANDY,711,"I'm just saying, yes, there are things
she does I don't agree with, but..."
712,3675,CHRISTIAN,712,"Oh, come on, Andy. You hate her. Just
admit it. She's a notorious sadist,
and not in the good way."
713,3676,ANDY,713,"Okay, so she's tough, but if Miranda
were a man, no one would notice
anything but how great she is at her
job."
714,3677,CHRISTIAN,714,"I can't believe this. You're defending
her. The wide-eyed girl peddling her
earnest newspaper stories -- you're
crossing over to the dark side."
715,3678,ANDY,715,I resent that.
716,3679,CHRISTIAN,716,You shouldn't. It's sexy.
717,3680,ANDY,717,Sexy? Really?
718,3681,CHRISTIAN,718,Really.
719,3682,ANDY,719,"I have no idea where we're going. You
could be leading me anywhere..."
720,3683,CHRISTIAN,720,"Don't worry. I know this city like the
back of my hand. It's my favorite
place on the planet. You know what
Gertrude Stein said -- ""America is my
country and Paris is my hometown."""
721,3684,ANDY,721,"You are unbelievable. Do you write
that stuff down and file it away to
use on girls?"
722,3685,CHRISTIAN,722,"I work free-lance. Leaves me with some
time on my hands."
723,3686,ANDY,723,"Well, I never understood why everyone
was so crazy about Paris, but now..."
724,3687,ANDY (CONT'D),724,It's. So. Beautiful.
725,3688,ANDY (CONT'D),725,I can't do this.
726,3689,ANDY (CONT'D),726,"Nate and I only split up a few days
ago."
727,3690,ANDY (CONT'D),727,"I've had too much wine and my
judgement is impaired."
728,3691,ANDY (CONT'D),728,"I barely know you and I'm in a strange
city."
729,3692,ANDY (CONT'D),729,I'm out of excuses.
730,3693,CHRISTIAN,730,Thank God.
731,3694,ANDY,731,What the hell is this?
732,3695,NIGEL,732,"For seventy-two years, Runway has been
more than a magazine, it's been a
beacon of elegance and grace. Miranda
Priestly is the finest possible
guardian of that beacon, setting a
standard that inspires people across
the globe. Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you Miranda Priestly."
733,3696,MIRANDA,733,"Thank you everyone. Before I talk to
you about James and everything he's
accomplished, I have news."
734,3697,MIRANDA (CONT'D),734,"Tonight is not just an important night
for me, for Runway, and for James,
it's also important for someone else
in this room..."
735,3698,MIRANDA (CONT'D),735,"As of next month, James will be
partnering with CFG in an expansion of
his line."
736,3699,MIRANDA (CONT'D),736,"James and Runway have one important
thing in common -- a commitment to
excellence."
737,3700,NIGEL,737,"When the time is right, she'll pay me
back."
738,3701,ANDY,738,You sure about that?
739,3702,NIGEL,739,"No. But I hope for the best. I have
to."
740,3703,MIRANDA,740,I'm ready to go.
741,3704,MIRANDA,741,You thought I didn't know.
742,3705,MIRANDA (CONT'D),742,"I've known what was happening for
quite some time. It took a little
while to find a suitable alternative
for Jacqueline, one she would accept.
Turned out, that James Holt job is so
absurdly overpaid--"
743,3706,MIRANDA (V.O.),743,--she jumped at it.
744,3707,MIRANDA,744,"Then I let Irv know Jacqueline was
unavailable."
745,3708,MIRANDA (V.O.),745,"Truth is, there's no one who can do
what I do, her included."
746,3709,MIRANDA,746,"Any of his other choices would find
the job impossible and the magazine
would surely suffer. Especially
because of the list--"
747,3710,MIRANDA (V.O.),747,"--designers, photographers, editors,
writers, models, all of whom were
found and nurtured by me..."
748,3711,MIRANDA,748,"...all of whom have promised to follow
me whenever and if ever I leave
Runway. To any publication I choose.
Of course, as soon as Irv understood,
he reconsidered."
749,3712,MIRANDA,749,"I must say, I was impressed with you,
how intently you tried to warn me."
750,3713,MIRANDA (CONT'D),750,"I never thought I would say this,
Andrea, but I see some of myself in
you. Your dedication, your focus."
751,3714,MIRANDA (CONT'D),751,"People think success happens to you.
It doesn't. You choose it. Every day,
I choose excellence. Who else does
what I do, at my level? Nobody. They
don't even understand what it takes,
the days, measured in milliseconds..."
752,3715,MIRANDA (CONT'D),752,"But now you know --and I know -- that
you have it in you. That you can see
beyond what other people want and
choose for yourself."
753,3716,ANDY,753,But I don't think I am like that.
754,3717,ANDY (CONT'D),754,"I couldn't do what you did to Nigel,
Miranda. There's no way I could do
something like that."
755,3718,MIRANDA,755,"Of course you can. You already did. To
Emily."
756,3719,ANDY,756,"That's not what I -- that was
different. I didn't have a choice."
757,3720,MIRANDA,757,"No. You did choose. You chose to get
ahead. You want this life, those
choices are necessary."
758,3721,ANDY,758,"But what if it's not what I want? I
mean, what if I don't want to live the
way you do?"
759,3722,MIRANDA,759,"Don't be silly, Andrea. This is what
everyone wants. Everyone wants to be
us."
760,3723,LILY,760,Sorry. Town car's in the shop.
761,3724,ANDY,761,You're such a pain.
762,3725,LILY,762,And you'd be lost without me.
763,3726,ANDY,763,True.
764,3727,LILY,764,"Does this mean I have to give my purse
back?"
765,3728,NATE,765,"I have to be at work in ten minutes.
What's up?"
766,3729,ANDY,766,I just wanted to say...
767,3730,ANDY (CONT'D),767,"Nate, you were right. About
everything. I turned my back on my
friends, my family, on everything I
believed in. And for what?"
768,3731,NATE,768,Shoes. And jackets and belts and--
769,3732,ANDY,769,"Nate, I'm just... I'm so sorry."
770,3733,NATE,770,"I flew up to Boston while you were
gone. Interviewed at the Oak Room."
771,3734,ANDY,771,And?
772,3735,NATE,772,"You're looking at their new sous-chef.
I'm moving up there in a few weeks."
773,3736,ANDY,773,"That's great, I... congratulations."
774,3737,ANDY (CONT'D),774,"Don't know what I'm going to do
without those late night grilled
cheeses."
775,3738,NATE,775,"They have bread in Boston. Might even
have Jarlsberg. We might be able to
figure something out."
776,3739,ANDY,776,You think?
777,3740,NATE,777,You never know.
778,3741,NATE (CONT'D),778,"So, how about you? What are you going
to do now?"
779,3742,ANDY,779,Not sure.
780,3743,NATE,780,"I'm not worried about you. Anything
you try, you're gonna kick ass."
781,3744,ANDY,781,You think so?
782,3745,NATE,782,No. I know it.
783,3746,ANDY,783,"Thanks. I actually have a job
interview today."
784,3747,NATE,784,And that's what you're wearing?
785,3748,EDITOR,785,You know our pay is crap.
786,3749,ANDY,786,That's fine.
787,3750,EDITOR,787,"Your clips were excellent. That thing
on the janitor's union... that's
exactly what we do here."
788,3751,EDITOR (CONT'D),788,"My only question is... Runway? What
the hell kind of blip was that?"
789,3752,ANDY,789,"Learned a lot. In the end, though, I
kind of screwed it up."
790,3753,EDITOR,790,That's not what I hear.
791,3754,EDITOR (CONT'D),791,"I called over there for a reference,
left word with some snooty girl, next
thing you know I got a fax from
Miranda Priestly herself--"
792,3755,EDITOR (CONT'D),792,"...saying that of all the assistants
she had, you were by far her biggest
disappointment."
793,3756,EDITOR (CONT'D),793,"And that if I don't hire you I'm an
idiot."
794,3757,EDITOR (CONT'D),794,You must have done something right.
795,3758,EMILY,795,"My God, you call this a letter? Can
you spell any word in the English
language?"
796,3759,EMILY (CONT'D),796,Miranda Priestly's office.
797,3760,ANDY,797,"Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up. I
have a favor to ask you."
798,3761,EMILY,798,"You're joking. YOU have a favor to
ask of ME?"
799,3762,ANDY,799,"Thing is, I have all these clothes
from Paris and I don't have
anyplace to wear them, so I was
wondering... is there any way you
could take them off my hands?"
