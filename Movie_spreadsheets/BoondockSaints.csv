0,MONSIGNOR,0,"Thank you Father Macklepenny, for
coming all the way across town to be
our guest speaker today. I hope you
found our little parish to your
liking."
1,ANNABELLE MACMANUS (V.O.),1,"They've never been like anyone else.
From the moment they were born, of
the same womb, on the same day, they
just had their own way, my boys did.
And I always knew that one day they
would do something of true greatness.
I just never expected they would
bring about such a... such a
reckoning."
2,MONSIGNOR,2,"...and I am reminded of this holy
day of the sad story of Kitty
Geneviese. This poor soul cried out
time and time again for help but no
person answered her calls. Though
many saw, not one so much as called.
Her assailant wiped the bloody knife
off on her lifeless little body.
They watched as he simply walked
away. Nobody wanted to get involved.
Nobody wanted to take a stand... We
must fear evil men and deal with
them accordingly but what we must
truly guard against, what we must
fear most"
3,MONSIGNOR,3,Is the indifference of good men.
4,CONNOR,4,"I do believe the Monsignor finally
got a point."
5,MURPHY,5,Aye.
6,CONNOR,6,What?
7,MCGERKIN,7,"Boys this is Rose, Baum, Gurtle...
Gurtle."
8,ROZ,8,Rozengurtle Baumgartner.
9,MCGERKIN,9,"You'll be training her today, and do
a good job."
10,BOTH BOYS,10,Aye.
11,CONNOR,11,Pleased ta meet ya Rozie.
12,ROZ,12,"I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by
men."
13,CONNOR,13,Okay then... let's get ya started.
14,MURPHY,14,"Christ, that's the largest woman
I've ever seen."
15,MCGERKIN,15,"It's self-imposed affirmative action.
If we hire big, fat, angry lesbians,
then the leftist groups representing
big, fat angry lesbians, won't think
we're violating their rights."
16,MURPHY,16,"Well, how politically correct you
are. That's good stuff."
17,MCGERKIN,17,"Hey, those people can shut ya down.
They'll sue you into the ground
claiming they were put under mental
duress, inner pain. and sufferin'."
18,MURPHY,18,"Well, as long as we're hirin' fat
lesbians, give your ma a call."
19,MCGERKIN,19,Fuck you Murphy.
20,CONNOR,20,"Okay, just cut off as much fat as
you can as it goes by and the rule
of thumb here is..."
21,ROZ,21,Rule of thumb?
22,CONNOR,22,Yeah?
23,ROZ,23,"Do you know where that term comes
from? In the early 1900's it was
legal for men to beat their wives as
long as they used a stick no wider
than their thumb."
24,CONNOR,24,"Can't do much damage with that.
Perhaps, it shoulda been the rule of
wrist. Ha!"
25,CONNOR,25,Rule of wrist.
26,CONNOR,26,Hey Murphy?
27,MURPHY,27,Aye.
28,CONNOR,28,"How many feminists does it take to
screw in a light bulb?"
29,MURPHY,29,How many?
30,CONNOR,30,"Two. One ta screw it in and one ta
suck my cock."
31,ROZ,31,"I knew you two pricks would give me
problems. Give me shit cause I'm a
woman. I'm not gonna take your male
dominance bullshit!"
32,CONNOR,32,"Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was
just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya."
33,MURPHY,33,"Yeah. Just tryin' ta break the ice
is all."
34,ROZ,34,Fuck you...
35,ROZ,35,...and fuck you!
36,MURPHY,36,"Oh, come on its St. Patty's Day.
It's all in good fun."
37,ROZ (V.O.),37,"Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck
face?"
38,CONNOR,38,"Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry.
Just relax."
39,CONNOR,39,"Why don't you save all your aggression
for protests and marches and what
not."
40,ROZ,40,"You fuckin' slaves. Kowtowing to the
needs of men! Get up! Get the fuck
up! Leave him there."
41,MURPHY,41,"Guess you'll have ta change that
tattoo now, won't ya Rozie!?"
42,CONNOR,42,Fuck you.
43,CONNOR,43,Hello.
44,MOM (V.O.),44,"Connor, is that you?"
45,CONNOR,45,"Mother, is that you?"
46,MOM (V.O.),46,"Is that worthless brother of your
there? I want you both ta hear this."
47,CONNOR,47,"Ma, what's wrong?"
48,MURPHY,48,No fuckin' hot water man. That...
49,CONNOR,49,Shut it. It's Ma.
50,MOM (V.O.),50,"It's all your fault. Both you little
bastards. I was a fool to believe
you would bring me any peace. The
day your Da left us when you were
almost too young to remember, he
said the two of you would do me right
and make me proud, but he was wrong
and I got nothin' ta live for."
51,CONNOR,51,"Mother, what are you sayin'? You're
talkin' crazy here."
52,MURPHY,52,What's the matter with her?
53,MOM,53,"I finally found your Da's army
revolver, Connor."
54,CONNOR,54,"What the hell are you doin' with
Da's gun!?"
55,MURPHY,55,What the...?
56,MOM (V.O.),56,"I got it ta my head now.
I got it ta my head now."
57,CONNOR,57,What?! What are you doin'?
58,MOM (V.O.),58,"I want ta tell ya one last thing
before I pull the trigger."
59,CONNOR,59,"Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it
woman?! Now just calm down here."
60,MURPHY,60,Oh my god!
61,MOM (V.O.),61,I...
62,CONNOR,62,No ma! No!
63,MOM (V.O.),63,BLAME...
64,CONNOR & MURPHY,64,"Oh Jesus, No! No! Oh God! No Ma!"
65,MOM (V.O.),65,YOU...!
66,CONNOR,66,"Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!"
67,MURPHY,67,"Lord have mercy. That was a good one
ma."
68,MOM (V.O.),68,"Oh, Jesus! No ma! Christ ma! No!"
69,MURPHY,69,"Oh, she's quite proud of herself."
70,MOM,70,"Okay, seriously, both you listen ta
me now."
71,CONNOR,71,"All right, we're both here."
72,MOM,72,"It's only 11:00 here boys so I got
lot's more drinkin' ta do with your
worthless relatives down at the Anvil."
73,MURPHY,73,Just called ta torture us did ya?
74,CONNOR,74,How's Uncle Sibeal?
75,MOM,75,"Well, you know how it is with him.
Always complainin' he's never turnin'
a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn
family goes down there with no money,
cause we know he can't bear ta charge
us."
76,MOM,76,"But he's been havin' himself a nip
or two as well... Been up the
waitress' skirt all night, poor girl."
77,MURPHY,77,"Well you tell him ta take it easy
with that. He's gotta learn ta respect
women the way Connor does."
78,CONNOR,78,"Oh, Jesus."
79,MURPHY,79,"I gave him his first lesson in
sensitivity toward the fairer sex
just today."
80,CONNOR,80,"Don't even do it, ya bastard."
81,MURPHY,81,He got beat up by a girl.
82,CONNOR,82,"If that was a girl I want ta see
some papers. She had ta be just
preoperative for Christ sakes."
83,MOM,83,Lord's name.
84,BOTH,84,"Mother Mary, full of grace."
85,MOM,85,"What did you do, Connor?"
86,CONNOR,86,"Well, we tried ta make friends and
she gave me a shot ta the nuts."
87,MOM,87,"What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya
trounced her a good one!"
88,CONNOR,88,"Well, I didn't but..."
89,MURPHY,89,"Don't worry, I respected the hell
out of her for ya, Ma."
90,MOM,90,"Well listen, I know how my boys take
ta scrappin' when they take ta
drinkin'."
91,BOTH,91,Yes mother.
92,MOM,92,"I mean it now. I carried the two of
you little bastards around in my
belly at the same time you ungrateful
pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure
in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked
me dry."
93,MOM,93,"My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles.
I trip over em for Christ sakes, now
ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!"
94,MOM,94,Promise me boys.
95,MURPHY,95,We promise.
96,CONNOR,96,"Yeah, we promise."
97,MOM,97,"Well, there's my boys."
98,MOM,98,"Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused
a ruckus with that shot. Half the
damn neighborhood is comin'."
99,MURPHY,99,"All right, love ya ma. Listen, before
ya go just give us the goods, eh?"
100,CONNOR,100,Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
101,MOM,101,"Still bickerin' over that, huh?"
102,CONNOR,102,"Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came
out first?"
103,MOM,103,"All right, I suppose you have the
right ta know."
104,MOM,104,Are ya ready?
105,BOTH,105,Aye.
106,MOM,106,The one with the biggest cock!
107,CONNOR,107,Crazy woman.
108,CONNOR,108,Don't start. I've had ice on mine.
109,GREENLY,109,"...so these guys are just kickin'
the shit out of each other. This guy"
110,GREENLY,110,"Picks up an old kitchen sink that
some one threw out and crushes this
guy"
111,GREENLY,111,"With it. All right, so it makes a
big bang and alerts their friend,
who's standin' look out around the
corner. So he comes over and gets
into it with this guy,"
112,GREENLY,112,"He's angry at him, right? They get
into an altercation in which the
look out guy crushes this guy by
jumpin on him. And look at the damage
here."
113,GREENLY,113,"I mean this guy's fuckin' hamburger
man. His spine is crushed. He's all
twisted and shit. That guy had to be
one big mother fucker. Huge, 3-400
pounds, fuckin huge."
114,GREELY,114,"Or, okay. Check this out. Say these
two don't even know the huge guy.
They're just staggerin' home from a
bar this morning, still all fucked
up from St. Patty's last night. So
they figure they'll take a short cut
down the alley and this big mother
fucker, he's just waitin'. And what
could be more perfect for strong arm
robbery? Two drunk guys all bandaged
up. They're already injured for Christ
sakes. He takes a blunt object and
whacks the guy with the bandage on
his head, right? Cause he's smart.
He knows the guy with the bandage on
his ass, he ain't going nowhere.
Matter of fact, this guy's probably
helping his friend with the rectal
problem along. They're limping around
like a couple of decrepit old broads.
So once this guy's out of the picture"
115,GREELY,115,"this poor asshole, he tries to run.
But look how far he gets fore the
huge bastard catches up with him.
Only a few yards. And what does he
do? He gets creative. He picks up a
sink and crushes the poor mother-
fucker. Then, he ain't done yet. He
comes over here, jumps on this guy's
back and crushes him to death."
116,GREELY,116,"He steals their shit and beats it!
Thanks for comin' out!"
117,GREELY,117,And look at this print...
118,GREENLY,118,"That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and
think about it. Of all the ways to
kill a guy, crushin' him to death.
That's very particular. You don't
get many of those. I dunno. I feel
something big here. I wouldn't be
surprised if we see more of these
turning up."
119,SMECKER,119,"Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy
theory and Serial crusher theory.
Top fucking notch."
120,SMECKER,120,What's your name?
121,GREENLY,121,"Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are
you?"
122,SMECKER,122,That's who the fuck I am.
123,CHIEF,123,"Listen, I gotta go by the numbers on
this one. I.D. just came back on
these guys. They've got connections
to the Russian mob. That makes it a
federal matter and Agent Smecker,
here, is heading up the investigation
with our full cooperation."
124,SMECKER,124,Why don't you get me a cup of coffee.
125,GREENY,125,What the fuck?
126,SMECKER,126,Café latte.
127,GREENLY,127,Who the...
128,SMECKER,128,Twist of lemon!
129,GREENLY,129,"Chief, what the fuck is this?"
130,SMECKER,130,Sweet-n-low!
131,SMECKER,131,"Mitchell, Langley!"
132,MITCHELL,132,Yes sir.
133,SMECKER,133,"Find the manager of this building.
See if he has had any complaints of
water coming down in any apartments,
starting just this morning. If he's
not there, knock on every door
starting from the third floor up.
Langley, you take this building,
same thing."
134,SMECKER,134,"Chaffey, Newman."
135,CHAFFEY,135,Yes sir.
136,SMECKER,136,"Look in the trash around their hands.
See if you can find me two bullet
casings. 45's, if my eye serves me
right. Don't disturb them. Mark them
as they lay. Newman, root through
this shit."
137,SMECKER,137,"If this was a sink find me some metal
parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain
cover or something."
138,CHAFFEY,138,Got it. It's a 45.
139,SMECKER,139,"Chief, could you get ballistics down
here and tell them they have to dig
a 45 slug out of a brick wall."
140,SMECKER,140,"...and locate another that's been
fired through a dumpster."
141,CHIEF,141,"I got the best ballistics guy in the
world. He's mobile. Got all his stuff
right in the van. Can have him down
here in 10 minutes."
142,DOLLY,142,How did you know that?
143,SMECKER,143,"Paraffin came up positive. And bullet
holes are usually a big clue."
144,CHAFFEY,144,"I can't find the second one, sir."
145,SMECKER,145,Look under the body.
146,CHAFFEY,146,Got it.
147,SMECKER,147,You guy's ready for this?
148,SMECKER,148,"This was no gangland assassination.
Though creative, it was way too
sloppy. Something went wrong here.
This has personal written all over
it. Now, these men were crushed and
the first natural reaction the body
has to such trauma is to tense up.
So now the two shots fired here were
reflex rounds. These guys weren't
shooting at anything, but they were
just about to."
149,MITCHELL,149,"Agent Smecker,"
150,MITCHELL,150,"This is all illegal loft housing so
there's no manager on the premises
but I found a lady on the fourth
floor said she's had water dripping
down on her whole place. Started
just this morning."
151,SMECKER,151,"Fourth floor huh? Then we're heading
to the fifth. Let's go up and see
just how right I am."
152,DUFFY,152,So what are you thinkin' here?
153,SMECKER,153,Really want to know?
154,GREENLY,154,"No way. You know how big a guy's
gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge."
155,SMECKER,155,"Oooo. I might be wanting a bagel
with my coffee."
156,GREENLY,156,I ain't getting him no fuckin' bagel.
157,SMECKER,157,"We'll start the ass kissing with
you."
158,MITCHELL,158,"Agent Smecker. I know this
neighborhood pretty good. There's a
bar called McGinty's down the block.
It's a good bet they were there last
night."
159,SMECKER,159,"Good work, Mitchell. I'll check that
out myself."
160,REPORTER,160,"Hey, Duffy. What the fuck happened
here? You owe me. This is the one I
want."
161,DUFFY,161,"Let's go get a cup of coffee. You
ain't gonna fuckin' believe this
one."
162,SMECKER,162,"I want A.P.B.'s put out. I want more
uniforms on the streets. One thing's
for sure, wherever these guys are
they're hurting."
163,MURPHY,163,"Okay. Just calm down. Take it easy.
He'll have his day. He'll have his"
164,MURPHY,164,FUCKIN' DAY!
165,MURPHY,165,"Thanks for comin', Doc."
166,DOC,166,"J-Jesus. What the fuck happened? Are
ya b-boys all right?"
167,CONNOR,167,We're alive.
168,DOC,168,"An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He
left me his c-c, he left me his c-c,
he left me this."
169,DOC,169,Fuck!..........Ass!
170,DOC,170,What are you going to do?
171,CONNOR,171,"We're going to turn ourselves in. It
was self defense."
172,DOC,172,y-y-yeah that's what he said.
173,MURPHY,173,"How the fuck's he know that? We
haven't spoken to anyone yet."
174,DOC,174,Don't know. He didn't say.
175,MURPHY,175,"Listen Doc, we need a favor."
176,DOC,176,A-anything.
177,CONNOR,177,"Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be
comin back for it when we get out."
178,DOC,178,Right.
179,SMECKER,179,"First of all, I'd like to thank
whichever one of you donut munching,
barrel-assed dip-shits leaked this
to the press. That's just what we
need now, some sensational story in
the papers making these guys out to
be super heroes, triumphing over
evil. And let me squash the rumors
now. These two aren't heroes."
180,SMECKER,180,"They are two ordinary men who were
put in an extraordinary situation
and they just happened to come out
on top. Yes, nothing from our far
reaching computer system has turned
up jack shit on these two. All we
know is what we found out from their
neighbors. And the general consensus
is that they're... angels."
181,SMECKER,181,"But angels don't kill and we got two
bodies in the morgue that look like
they've been..."
182,SMECKER,182,"...serial crushed by a huge fuckin'
guy."
183,CHAFFEY,183,"Are these me considered armed and
dangerous?"
184,SMECKER,184,"Well, not armed. If they had guns,
they'd have used them. But dangerous?
Oh yeah."
185,MITCHELL,185,"What makes you think they're
dangerous? They were just protecting
each other."
186,SMECKER,186,"Look, look! I'm not saying one way
or the other. Just be careful and go
by the protocol on this one."
187,CHAFFEY,187,Any tips on where these guys may be?
188,SMECKER,188,Any word back from the E.R.s?
189,MITCHELL,189,"No help at all. Swamped from St.
Patty's. Packed with drunk, bloody
Irish."
190,SMECKER,190,Just hit the bricks nice and hard.
191,GREENLY,191,These guys are miles away by now.
192,GREENLY,192,"But if you want to beat your head
against a wall, then here's what you
look for. These guys are scared like
two little bunny rabbits. Anything
in a uniform or flashing blue lights
will spook them. So the only thing
we can do is put a potato on a string
and drag it through South Boston."
193,MURPHY,193,"You'd probably have better luck with
a beer."
194,SMECKER,194,"What the fuck is this!? This isn't a
fuckin' tea party. Get out! Only
thing I want in here is them."
195,SMECKER,195,"This conversation is going to be
recorded. Just answer to the best of
your knowledge."
196,MURPHY,196,"Excuse me, sir."
197,MURPHY,197,"""What do we tell him about the guns
and money?"""
198,CONNOR,198,"""We just got up and left. Bum musta
rolled them before the police got
there."""
199,MURPHY,199,Okay. We're ready.
200,SMECKER,200,"You guys are not under oath, here. I
am assuming you knew these two guys
from before, huh?"
201,CONNOR,201,We... met them last night.
202,SMECKER,202,"They had some pretty interesting
bandages. Know anything about that?"
203,CONNOR,203,"Would someone please come over here
and..."
204,DOC,204,Fuck!
205,CONNOR,205,me up the...
206,DOC,206,Ass!
207,ROCCO,207,Hey! Fuck! Ass! Get me a beer!
208,ROCCO,208,"...It's not that I'm homophobic. I'm
just afraid of faggots."
209,DOC,209,"I got some bad news. Looks like I'm
gonna have ta close d-down the bar.
The Russians have been buying up
buildings all over town, including
this one... Fuck!... Ass! And they're
not letting me renew my lease. I got
'til the end of the week to come up
with 26,000 dollars, or they take
the place. I left them a note telling
them not to show their faces t-
tonight. They been pressuring me ta
close and take the last few days ta
get all my shit outta here but it's
my right to stay open ta the last."
210,ROCCO,210,"Let me talk to my boss, may I can..."
211,DOC,211,"L-l-listen I don't want anyone ta
know until the last possible moment.
So you guys keep your traps shut. ya
know what they say; People in glass
houses sink ships."
212,ROCCO,212,"Y'know Doc, I gotta get you a, a,
like a proverb book or something.
This mix and match shit's gotta go."
213,DOC,213,What?
214,CONNOR,214,"A p-penny saved is worth two in the
bush."
215,MURPHY,215,"Don't c-cross the road if ya can't
get out of the kitchen."
216,CHECKOV,216,"I am Ivan Checkov. You will be closing
now."
217,MURPHY,217,"This is McCoy... we find Spock and
we got enough for an away team."
218,CHECKOV,218,"Oh, how extraordinary. A bunch of
Irishmen... and they are being drunken
idiots. You are killing the
stereotype. I'm in no mood for
discussion."
219,CHECKOV,219,"You! You stay. The rest of you go
now."
220,DOC,220,"Why don't you make like a tree and
get the fuck outta here!"
221,CONNOR,221,"Calm down, Doc. I'm sure they're
reasonable fellows."
222,CONNOR,222,"Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til
this week's end. Ya don't have ta be
hard asses, do ya?"
223,MURPHY,223,"Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's
Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya
pull up a stool and have a drink
with us?"
224,CHECKOV,224,"You insult me. I would never drink
that sewage. Especially with you
people. You are fools."
225,CHECKOV,225,"This is no game! If you won't go, we
will make you go!"
226,CONNOR,226,"If ya want a fight, you can see you're
outnumbered. We're trying ta be civil
here, so I suggest you take our offer."
227,CHECKOV,227,"I make the offers, ass-hole."
228,ROCCO,228,"Hey, there Boris. What would you say
if I told you that your pinko, commie
mother sucked so much dick..."
229,CONNOR,229,"""Now, that wasn't too polite, was
it?"""
230,MURPHY,230,"""I'm afraid we can't let that one
go, Ivan."""
231,CONNOR,231,I don't think Ma would mind.
232,CONNOR,232,"Let the boy go. He knows what the
fuck he's doing!"
233,CONNOR,233,"Nicely done, boy!"
234,CONNOR,234,"Now, like my fine brother says, on
St. Patty's everyone's Irish. And
this piece of shit is about to be
initiated."
235,FRIEND #1,235,"Are ya tryin' ta kill him, ya fuck?"
236,CHECKOV,236,"I was going to kill you. But I'm
not... I'm going to kill your brother.
I'm going to take him down to the
dumpster and I'm going to shoot him
in the head. Then I'm going to throw
his dead body in the garbage."
237,CHECKOV,237,"Trash guys are coming in 10 minutes,
gotta go."
238,MURPHY,238,"It was just a bar fight. You guys
are fuckin' pussies!"
239,CHECKOV,239,"I hope your conscience is clear,
Irishman."
240,SMECKER,240,"So, how is it that you guys are fluent
in Russian?"
241,CONNOR,241,We paid attention in school.
242,SMECKER,242,Know any other languages?
243,MURPHY,243,"Aye. Our mother insisted on it.
French."
244,MURPHY,244,"How do you think he figured all this
out without talking to us?"
245,CONNOR,245,Italian.
246,CONNOR,246,"I have no idea. Maybe someone saw
and talked."
247,MURPHY,247,German.
248,MURPHY,248,"Not in our neighborhood, man. A
hundred percent Irish. No one talks
to cops. Period."
249,CONNOR,249,Spanish.
250,CONNOR,250,"Then I guess he's just real... real
good."
251,SMECKER,251,"What are you guys doing working at a
fucking meat packing plant?"
252,CHAFFEY,252,"Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem."
253,SMECKER,253,What?
254,CHAFFEY,254,"The press is everywhere outside.
They're going nuts for these guys.
What do you want to do?"
255,SMECKER,255,"You're not being charged. It's up to
you. Do you want to talk to them?"
256,CONNOR,256,Absolutely not.
257,MURPHY,257,"No pictures, either."
258,SMECKER,258,"Well, we could try the bag over the
head thing. Walk you right out the
front."
259,CONNOR,259,Our mother can see through bags.
260,MURPHY,260,"Aye, she can."
261,MURPHY,261,Any way we can stay here?
262,CHAFFEY,262,"Sure, we have an empty holding cell,
They can... can they stay?"
263,SMECKER,263,"Well, we'll have to check with your
mother, but it's ok with me if your
friends sleep over."
264,SMECKER,264,Time to feed the dogs.
265,CONNOR,265,He's a nice guy.
266,MURPHY,266,Yes... he is.
267,CHIEF,267,"This is our official statement. The
MacManus brothers are not being
charged with a crime. It was a clean-
cut case of self defense. We have
thanked them for their cooperation
and we thank you, the media, for
your tireless pursuit of the truth."
268,CONNOR,268,Destroy all that which is evil...
269,MURPHY,269,...so that which is good may flourish
270,CONNOR,270,Be right back...
271,DUFFY,271,"We would be honored, sir, if you
would join us peasants, in a donut."
272,MURPHY,272,Saints?
273,MURPHY,273,"I will not accept this pizzle until
my feet have been properly anointed."
274,VINCENZO,274,"Well, it's the funny man. Give it
here, package boy."
275,ROCCO,275,"Joey Bevo said it was important.
Said I had to give it to him myself."
276,VINCENZO,276,"Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the
fuck down!"
277,VINCENZO,277,"I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee
Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee."
278,ROCCO,278,Fuck you Vincenzo.
279,VINCENZO,279,Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
280,ROCCO,280,"I caught your show down at the velvet
room at the Holiday Inn, loved it
when you busted into Viva Las Vegas."
281,ROCCO,281,"Hey, hey, hey..."
282,YAKAVETTA,282,"Fuck you! I could snap my fingers
and have you dead in four hours,
rotting in a truck off of Boyleston!
You insignificant little fuck! I
always get my fuckin' money!"
283,YAKAVETTA,283,"Fuckin' 90's are killin' me. I
shouldn't a done that. You're not
supposed to tell a guy you're gonna
kill him anymore. I gotta tip-toe
through the tulips with these
assholes. I prance. I'm a prancer.
It's what I do... sucked all the fun
right out of this job."
284,ROCCO,284,"Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?"
285,YAKAVETTA,285,"Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya."
286,YAKAVETTA,286,"Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here."
287,ROCCO,287,Yeah boss?
288,YAKAVETTA,288,"I always see you talking to the boys
and making them laugh. They always
come around telling me what a crack
up you are. What is it they call
you?"
289,ROCCO,289,The... The funny man.
290,YAKAVETTA,290,"The funny man. Well, I got a new job
for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having
a real shitty day. I'm depressed.
Tell me a funny story or a joke."
291,ROCCO,291,"Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one
about the, no fuck that one... uh...
oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's
a white guy. He's walkin' along the
beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know
and ah, he rubs it and this genie
pops out. But this genie, he's a
ni... he's a black guy."
292,YAKAVETTA,292,He's a nigger.
293,ROCCO,293,"Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He
says, ""Why you crackers always gotta
find my mother fuckin' pot? And he
tells him he's gonna grant all his
three wishes but he's gonna give all
the black guys..."
294,VINCENZO AND YAKAVETTA,294,Niggers!
295,ROCCO,295,"Sorry! Sorry! All the niggers on the
planet get double what he wishes
for. ""I'll take a million dollars,""
he says. Genie give it to him and
says every nigger on earth just got
two million. ""I don't care gimme a
yacht."" Poof there it is."
296,ROCCO,296,"E-every bl... every nigger just got
two yachts. Genie goes..."
297,ROCCO,297,"I'm sorry Poppa Joe. I can't. This
joke sucks."
298,YAKAVETTA,298,Continue the joke.
299,ROCCO,299,"He says, ""What's your third wish?""
And the guys says, ""I-I want you to
beat me half to death."""
300,YAKAVETTA,300,"Very good stuff, Rocco. Very good
stuff. Tell me another one."
301,CONNOR,301,"Know what we need, man?... some rope."
302,MURPHY,302,For what?
303,CONNOR,303,Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
304,MURPHY,304,What?
305,CONNOR,305,"Yeah, these guys always got a lot of
rope strapped around em in the movies
and they always end up using it."
306,MURPHY,306,"Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?"
307,CONNOR,307,I'm serious.
308,MURPHY,308,"Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing
we're gonna need it for."
309,CONNOR,309,"I don't know they just always need
it."
310,MURPHY,310,"What is all this ""they"" shit? This
ain't a movie."
311,CONNOR,311,"Is that right, Rambo?"
312,MURPHY,312,"All right, get the stupid fuckin'
rope."
313,SMECKER,313,"Uh,huh."
314,SMECKER,314,Room number.
315,SMECKER,315,We got a time of death?
316,SMECKER,316,What's the body count?
317,SMECKER,317,"Uh, huh."
318,SMECKER,318,"I'll be down there in a bit. Keep
the press out."
319,SMECKER,319,What are you doing?
320,REUBEN,320,I was just trying to cuddle.
321,SMECKER,321,Cuddle?...
322,SMECKER,322,What a fag!
323,SMECKER,323,"He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?"
324,GREENLY,324,"Why do you always disrespect me like
that?"
325,SMECKER,325,"Respect is earned, Greenly, never
given. Guys like you should have to
follow me around squabbling for the
scraps from my table."
326,SMECKER,326,"How many bodies, Greenly?"
327,GREENLY,327,Eight.
328,GREENLY,328,"No! Shit! I didn't see that one.
Nine! Nine!"
329,SMECKER,329,"While Greenly's getting coffee,
anybody else want anything?"
330,GREENLY,330,Shit! Shit!
331,SMECKER,331,"So Duffy, got any theories to go
with that... tie."
332,DUFFY,332,"These guys were pros. I think they
were coming for one target, the fag
man, he was the..."
333,SMECKER,333,The what man?
334,DUFFY,334,The fat man.
335,SMECKER,335,"Well, Freud was right. So you think
they came for the fag man, huh? And
what do you base this upon?"
336,DUFFY,336,"He was the only one done right. Two
in the back of the head."
337,SMECKER,337,And the pennies?
338,DUFFY,338,New hitman wants to leave his mark
339,SMECKER,339,"That's a possibility. Y'know you
Boston cops are perking up. That's
two sound theories in one day, neither
of which deal with abnormally sized
men."
340,SMECKER,340,"Another possibility is that they
were placed there with religious
intent."
341,DUFFY,341,"Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies
in the eyes of the dead, or silver."
342,SMECKER,342,The Greeks. The Italians.
343,DUFFY,343,The Sicilians.
344,DOLLY,344,What's the symbology there?
345,SMECKER,345,"Symbology? Well, now that Duffy has
relinquished his King Bone Head crown
I see we have an heir to the throne.
I'm sure the word you were looking
for was symbolism. What's the
symbolism there? Let me explain it
to you. In Greek and Roman mythology
when you died you would have to pay
the toll to Charon, the boatman who
ferried you across to the gates of
judgment. This made sure the dead
came to atone for what they did during
their lives, Detective..."
346,SMECKER,346,Dollapoppaskalious.
347,DOLLY (DOLLAPOPPASKALIOUS),347,"Holy shit. You're the first one that's
ever got that."
348,SMECKER,348,"Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name-
ology."
349,SMECKER,349,"I've seen burns like these before.
They used silencers. Look at these
entry and exit wounds. They're
identical."
350,SMECKER,350,"The two bullets went in here, through
the top of the skull, criss-crossed
and exited through the eyeballs.
This one clue tells us three distinct
facts. Number one... Duffy."
351,DUFFY,351,They shot him at a downward angle.
352,DUFFY,352,They put him on his knees.
353,SMECKER,353,Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
354,GREENLY,354,Uh.
355,GREENLY,355,"Shit, I, uh..."
356,SMECKER,356,"It tells us that he was the last to
die. All these men"
357,SMECKER,357,"Were carrying. They came in, dropped
all in seconds and then took their
time with fag man. Didn't they,
Duffy?!"
358,SMECKER,358,They sure as fuck did!
359,SMECKER,359,"And number three, Dolly."
360,DOLLY,360,Uh... two shooters!
361,SMECKER,361,Fan-fuckin-tastic!
362,SMECKER,362,"Now stay with me, boys. What did
they do to make two such identical
wounds? Did one guy put him on his
knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up
and shoot him again the same way?
No. Two men of similar height dropped
this guy down, each put some iron to
his head and boom! That's all she
fuckin' wrote!"
363,DUFFY,363,What about one guy with two guns?
364,SMECKER,364,"Possible, but unlikely. The angles
are too extreme. A guy holding two
guns to the back of your head is
gonna shoot straight ahead. He
wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes
no sense. Besides, you telling me
one guy came in here and killed eight
men with eight extremely well aimed
shots in just a few seconds? No way.
Had to be at least two."
365,SMECKER,365,"Television,... television is the
explanation for this."
366,SMECKER,366,You see this is bad television.
367,SMECKER,367,"The little assault guys creeping in
through the vents and coming in
through the ceilings. That James
Bond shit never happens in real life.
Professionals don't do that. So we've
got this up here, which has novice
written all over it. And all this
down here that's simply a perfect
textbook assassination. So here's
our two possibilities. We either
have rank amateurs that got lucky or
consummate professionals that fucked
up."
368,SMECKER,368,"Join me in a drink, gentlemen."
369,SMECKER,369,"With the exception of my coffee boy,
you Boston detectives are starting
to show signs of intelligence. So, I
am going to make you privy to some
information that you would not
normally be. These men are all Russian
mob. Not like those two peons in the
alley the other day. These guys are
all syndicate bosses and underbosses.
I have a dossier on every man in
this room. Since the Iron Curtain
has gone down, the Russian syndicates
have started to come here. And in
the spirit of Glasnost the Soviets
have opened their borders to the
mafia. But the Italians, they're not
convinced that the grounds in mother
Russia are fertile enough for
organized crime yet. So they ain't
ready to commit. The Russians are
coming here anyway. They are
unwelcome. What we have here,
gentlemen, is possibly the beginning
of the first international mob war...
unless I've totally missed something."
370,SMECKER,370,"Now, what is this going to look like
to those who do not know what I just
told you?"
371,DUFFY,371,"It's gonna look like the bad guys
are killing each other."
372,SMECKER,372,"And is there an American, shit is
there a man seated among us that
hasn't thought about it many times,
let's just put them all on an island,
give them guns and let them kill
each other. This is our wet dream
come true. You can expect federal
and local law enforcement to go only
deep enough to satisfy the law, then
bury it from here on out."
373,DOLLY,373,"So, what do we do now?"
374,SMECKER,374,"That depends. You either do your job
or get ethical."
375,ROCCO,375,This better be good.
376,ROCCO,376,Talk!
377,MURPHY,377,Nervous?
378,CONNOR,378,A bit.
379,MURPHY,379,"Me, too."
380,MURPHY,380,You and your fucking rope.
381,CONNOR,381,See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
382,MURPHY,382,Just like on TV.
383,MURPHY,383,Where the fuck are you going?
384,CONNOR,384,We'll find it. Just calm down.
385,MURPHY,385,"No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit.
I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin'
this stupid thing around. Must weigh
30 pounds."
386,CONNOR,386,"We're doing some serious shit here.
Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole."
387,MURPHY,387,"Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin'
Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's
getting' us lost!"
388,CONNOR,388,"Sh, sh! Fuck you!"
389,MURPHY,389,"No, fuck you!"
390,BOTH,390,"And shepherds we shall be. For thee,
my Lord, for thee. Power hath
descended forth from thy hand that
our feet may swiftly carry out thy
command. So we shall flow a river
forth to thee and teeming with souls
shall it ever be. E nomini patri, et
Fili e spiritu sancti."
391,CONNOR,391,That was some good fuckin' rope.
392,MURPHY,392,That was way easier than I thought.
393,CONNOR,393,Aye.
394,MURPHY,394,"On TV ya always get that asshole
that jumps behind the couch."
395,CONNOR,395,"Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for
ten minutes."
396,MURPHY,396,"Oh, we're good man."
397,CONNOR,397,"Yes, we are."
398,MURPHY,398,I love our new job.
399,ROCCO,399,"Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the
same side! The boss musta sent you
in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please!
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man."
400,ROCCO,400,They call me the funny fuckin' man!
401,CONNOR,401,Where's your gun?
402,ROCCO,402,Chest pocket.
403,ROCCO,403,Shit!
404,CONNOR,404,This is a six-shooter.
405,MURPHY,405,Nine bodies.
406,CONNOR,406,"Oh, you're good. What were you gonna
do? Laugh the last three to death,
funny man?"
407,ROCCO,407,"Poppa Joe said there was only two.
In and out."
408,ROCCO,408,"Boy, you guys sure did a good job.
You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd
you get them?"
409,CONNOR,409,Let's do him right here.
410,MURPHY,410,Right now.
411,ROCCO,411,"Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the
funny man... the funny."
412,ROCCO,412,"What did you do?! Fuckin'... what
the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked
this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two
fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!"
413,CONNOR,413,"Certainly illustrates the diversity
of the word."
414,ROCCO,414,"What the fuck are you doing here?
What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS!
I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!"
415,CONNOR,415,"Get a hold of yourself, man."
416,MURPHY,416,"Yeah, get a hold of yourself."
417,CONNOR,417,"Listen, we gotta get outta here now.
We'll take separate exits and meet
at Rocco's."
418,ROCCO,418,Fuck!
419,ROCCO,419,Anybody you think is evil?
420,CONNOR,420,Yes.
421,ROCCO,421,"Don't you think that's a little
psycho? A little weird?"
422,CONNOR,422,"Weird, huh?... Know what I think is
weird? Decent men with loving families
go home every day after work. They
turn on the news and see rapists,
murderers, and child molesters all
getting out of prison."
423,MURPHY,423,"Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos
and walkin' on bail the same day."
424,CONNOR,424,"Little girls catchin' stray bullets
in their heads, playin' hopscotch in
their front yards. And everyone thinks
the same thing... Someone should
just go kill those motherfuckers."
425,MURPHY,425,"Kill em all. Admit it, even you've
thought about it."
426,ROCCO,426,"You guys should be in every major
city."
427,ROCCO,427,"This is some heavy shit. This is
like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it!
There's so much shit that pisses me
off. You guys should recruit 'cause
I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin'
down the street waitin' for one of
these assholes to get me, y'know?"
428,MURPHY,428,"Hallelujah, Jaffar."
429,ROCCO,429,"So you're not just talkin' mob guys.
You're talkin' anyone, right? Even
like pimps and drug dealers and all
that shit?"
430,ROCCO,430,"Well fuck, you guys could do this
every day."
431,MURPHY,431,"We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always
doing business, but we're always
open."
432,CONNOR,432,Nicely put.
433,ROCCO,433,"You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm
fuckin' done. Permanent package boy."
434,MURPHY,434,"Who says that? You could take credit
on it."
435,ROCCO,435,What are you serious?
436,MURPHY,436,"Yeah, fuck it. If you think about
it, it's all you can do really. You
can't tell him it was us. Go in
braggin' and shit."
437,CONNOR,437,"Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don
Rocco."
438,ROCCO,438,"Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it.
I've been working for those fat
bastards since I was in high school
and look at this place."
439,ROCCO,439,"They're fuckin' me man! Hey, they
can suck my pathetic little dick.
And I'll dip my nuts in marinara
just so the fat fucks can get a taste
of home while they're at it. That's
it, it's done, I'm doing it."
440,MURPHY,440,"I can't fuckin' believe that just
happened!"
441,CONNOR,441,"Donna's gonna be angry about her
cat."
442,ROCCO,442,"Shit. She's on every drug know to
man. She'd have sold that thing for
a dime bag. Screw her."
443,ROCCO,443,But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
444,CONNOR,444,You sound real remorseful.
445,ROCCO,445,She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
446,CONNOR,446,"Listen. Something's been bothering
me about last night."
447,ROCCO,447,What?
448,CONNOR,448,"Well... what if your boss knew how
many guys were supposed to be there...
in that room?"
449,ROCCO,449,What are you saying?
450,CONNOR,450,"Think about it man. Nine men, six
bullets."
451,ROCCO,451,You think they sold me out? No way.
452,CONNOR,452,"He probably knew you'd end up nailing
the fat guy, maybe one or two more,
but he had to know you weren't walking
out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's
dead on the scene. No in-depth
investigation. It'd slide right off
his back. 'Cause as much as I love
ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone.
What would he be losing? A thirty-
five year old delivery boy?"
453,ROCCO,453,"No, no. That's just not the way things
are done. Besides, how's he know I
don't just get in there see there's
too many and just serve em their
fuckin' food and beat it?"
454,CONNOR,454,"He knows you, man. He knows all you
want is to move up. That's all. A
smooth hitter woulda gone in there,
seen it was a wash and slipped out.
But a guy like you? Knowin' this is
your only chance? Waitin' eighteen
years?"
455,ROCCO,455,"No. No man. That's... that's... you
don't know what you're talking about.
That's bullshit. I know these guys.
I mean, thanks for your concern, but
that just ain't the thing of it."
456,CONNOR,456,"Do me a favor and roll it around for
a bit on your way in."
457,ROCCO,457,"No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs
to be rolled."
458,MURPHY,458,Where are you goin'?
459,MURPHY,459,Did you tell him?
460,CONNOR,460,Yes.
461,MURPHY,461,Then what the fuck?
462,ROCCO,462,"Hey. You don't know that shit for
sure."
463,MURPHY,463,"Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin'
retard!"
464,ROCCO,464,Fuck you!
465,MURPHY,465,"Use your brain for once. Is it so
unbelievable they don't care about
you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in
there today. Dead!"
466,ROCCO,466,"Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know
what's going on, huh?"
467,ROCCO,467,Fuck you!
468,CONNOR,468,"Hey, this ain't a thing you should
gamble on, Roc."
469,MURPHY,469,"Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya
want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop.
This is the last time I'll see you.
Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch."
470,ROCCO,470,I'll be back at 9:00.
471,CONNOR,471,"Hey. You get in there and start
getting a bad vibe, get the fuck out
quick."
472,MURPHY,472,Hello?
473,ROCCO (V.O.),473,Hey Murph.
474,MURPHY,474,Roc. You okay?
475,ROCCO (V.O.),475,Yeah. Anybody call for me?
476,MURPHY,476,No. You sure you're okay?
477,ROCCO (V.O.),477,I'm fuckin' fine.
478,ROCCO (V.O.),478,Catch you on the flip side.
479,DONNA,479,"Here kitty, kitty...... kitty."
480,DOLLY,480,She was in here when it went down.
481,SMECKER,481,Can she I.D. them?
482,DOLLY,482,They were wearing masks.
483,SMECKER,483,Of course they were. How many?
484,DOLLY,484,Three.
485,DOLLY,485,Only two did the shooting.
486,DOLLY,486,"So what are you thinking, Russian
retaliation?"
487,SMECKER,487,"Nah, too quick half their
infrastructure got taken out at the
Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a
hitter, you're either working for
the Russians or the Italians. There's
no riding the fence. Our little theory
from last night just got blown to
shit. Something... new is going on
here."
488,SMECKER,488,"Probably shouldn't work another shift
for awhile."
489,DANCER,489,"Fuck this job. I'm getting out of
the porno business and I don't care
who I gotta blow to do it."
490,SMECKER,490,"After talking to the dancer we know
that their mark was the guy in the
middle booth. After she watches them
whack him, she passes out."
491,SMECKER,491,Why the two extra victims?
492,GREENLY,492,Witness?
493,SMECKER,493,No way they could have seen it.
494,SMECKER,494,"Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen
to the protocol of the porno industry,
as I'm sure you've never been in one
of these places before. A man goes
into the booth, puts the money in
the slot. The dancer gets it on the
other side. She hits the button,
door goes up, now there is only glass
between you and it's"
495,SMECKER,495,little fireman time.
496,DUFFY,496,No way they could have seen it?
497,SMECKER,497,"Those doors were down... which means
this. They looked down in through
the peep hole, saw these guys and
opened the doors from the inside.
Pop, pop, pop, right through the
glass. Why?"
498,DOLLY,498,"Maybe the three of them had something
in common."
499,SMECKER,499,No. This guy is big time.
500,SMECKER,500,These two are street-walking scum.
501,GREENLY,501,"Then that's what they had in common.
They were all bad guys... now they're
all dead bad guys."
502,SMECKER,502,"We got another thing to think about
here. We got us a genuine Kennedy
assassination style bullet theory.
Two guns were used here, guns A and
B. The guy in the middle was done
with both. But this guy..."
503,SMECKER,503,"...he was killed with bullets from
gun A only. And this guy..."
504,SMECKER,504,"...gun B only. But ballistics dug
two slugs out of the wall from over
here where the victim was done with
A."
505,SMECKER,505,"And it's the same story over here.
Why the crossover?"
506,SMECKER,506,Theories.
507,DOLLY,507,"That's just fucking weird. I have no
idea."
508,DUFFY,508,"Jesus. I just can't think anymore.
That scene over at the coffee shop
today tapped me out."
509,SMECKER,509,What?
510,DUFFY,510,"A guy went nuts over off of
Commonwealth today. Shot three guys
to death in a coffee shop in broad
daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have
much on him."
511,SMECKER,511,Why was I not informed of this?
512,GREENLY,512,"They weren't related. The guy used a
38. No pennies. Totally amateur."
513,SMECKER,513,Who were the victims?
514,GREENLY,514,A couple of peons for the mob and...
515,SMECKER,515,"Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the
scumbags in the quiet city of Boston
start dropping dead and you think
it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I
want the Boston Police doing my
thinking for me, I will have a fucking
tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad
car and get me over there. I want
the crime scene photos and any witness
statements. NOW!"
516,SMECKER,516,"Oh... it looks like we got us a
cowboy."
517,SMECKER,517,"The shooter knew these guys, huh?"
518,DOLLY,518,How do you figure?
519,SMECKER,519,"Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends."
520,SMECKER,520,"These guys were packing. Not one
hand near a gun. It's simple human
behavior. Someone you don't know
approaches you, you put your hand on
it. This guy's got his hands on the
table. He's eating his food, for
Christ sakes. They were friends."
521,SMECKER,521,"These two fucking scenes are related.
Too many coincidences. Same day?
Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on
both scenes. Now, why did he kill
the bartender?"
522,DUFFY,522,"Crime of passion. He just went nuts.
He would have shot everyone in here.
He just ran out of bullets."
523,SMECKER,523,"Duffy. This look like a fucking post
office to you? This guy came in here
with intent. Maybe he didn't know
exactly what he was gonna do but he
had a pretty good idea. The bartender
wasn't a fucking accident."
524,DUFFY,524,"Well, we didn't get any help on that.
A lot of people saw it. Nobody's
talking."
525,SMECKER,525,"Fucking figures. Look, are you guys
seeing the pattern here? We got big
questions at both of these crime
scenes, with no answers. WHY did
they kill the guys in the other two
booths? WHY did he do the bartender?
It would seem unnecessary, even
stupid."
526,SMECKER,526,"God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm
fucking leaving now. And do me a
favor, tell me when the next guy
dies, cause these guys are not done
yet."
527,MURPHY (V.O.),527,Hello?
528,ROCCO,528,"Hey, Murph."
529,MURPHY (V.O.),529,Roc. You okay?
530,ROCCO,530,Yeah. Anybody call for me?
531,MURPHY (V.O.),531,No. You sure you're okay?
532,ROCCO,532,I'm fuckin' fine.
533,ROCCO,533,Catch you on the flip side.
534,ROCCO,534,"Pack your shit! We gotta get outta
here! We gotta get out!"
535,CONNOR,535,What happened?
536,ROCCO,536,"I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em
all!!"
537,DONNA,537,Rocco?
538,MURPHY,538,"Hey, hey. Just calm down. Tell us
what happened!"
539,ROCCO,539,"No! Fuck you! You start getting
excited! We gotta fucking go!"
540,DONNA,540,Rocco!
541,CONNOR,541,Who did you kill?
542,MURPHY,542,Holy shit. Who? How many?
543,ROCCO,543,Hurry the fuck up!
544,MURPHY,544,"This is some crazy shit, man!"
545,ROCCO,545,Those cocksuckers sold me out!
546,CONNOR,546,"Did I fuckin' tell ya, Rocco? They
pull on you first?"
547,DONNA,547,ROCCO!
548,ROCCO,548,"What did I fuckin' do?... in the
middle of the Lakeview."
549,CONNOR,549,"Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!"
550,MURPHY,550,"Ha! Ha! Roc, you got a jumbo set of
coconut balls man!"
551,DONNA/RAYVIE,551,ROCCO!
552,ROCCO,552,What?
553,DONNA,553,Where's my cat?
554,ROCCO,554,"I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie
bitch!"
555,DONNA,555,"You... oh god, why?"
556,ROCCO,556,"I felt it would bring closure to our
relationship!"
557,DONNA,557,You killed my... my...
558,ROCCO,558,Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
559,DONNA,559,"My, my..."
560,ROCCO,560,"Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself
in the head, you can tell me that
cats name! Go ahead... Your what?
Your precious little..."
561,DONNA,561,Pee...Per...Man.
562,ROCCO,562,"Peeperman? WRONG? What color was
it?!!!"
563,DONNA,563,It was... It was...
564,ROCCO,564,"Male or female, bitch?!!"
565,RAYVIE,565,"Don't you yell at her you fuckin'
prick!"
566,ROCCO,566,"Shut your fat ass, Rayvie! I can't
buy a pack of smokes without running
into nine guys you fucked."
567,DONNA,567,Don't you yell at her!
568,ROCCO,568,"All right, let's get the fuck outta
here!"
569,RAYVIE,569,Is my... I mean it's not really...?
570,DONNA,570,No. No. It's not fat.
571,ROCCO,571,"Those rat fucks! All of them were
all laughing at me man!"
572,MURPHY,572,You sure you killed them?
573,ROCCO (V.O.),573,"Fuckin-A-right I did. I had a goddam
turkey shoot over there."
574,VINNIE,574,"I'll bet it was a test. Vincenzo
came in here shooting his mouth off.
He was makin' sure we knew. But we
did what we were supposed to, eh? We
kept our mouths shut. You did your
part. They know we're goodfellas
now. We'll get taken care of."
575,ROCCO,575,"What? Did everyone know? Next thing
you'll tell me Sal was in on it."
576,OLY,576,"Fuck. Vincenzo told Sal first. That
fat fuck knew before we did."
577,OLY,577,At least we got our funny man back.
578,CONNOR,578,Anybody see ya?
579,ROCCO,579,"Fuck, man! I may as well have posted
flyers. Right out in public, man."
580,MURPHY,580,Liberating isn't it?
581,ROCCO,581,"Y'know it is, a bit."
582,ROCCO,582,Stop the car!
583,ROCCO,583,"Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker,
Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one
who set me up. Then he went around
shooting his mouth off, telling
everyone I was as good as dead. He
goes in there every Wednesday night
around 10:00, he jerks off in the
same booth to the same titty dancer.
Never misses."
584,MURPHY,584,So?
585,ROCCO,585,"So let's kill the motherfucker. I
mean, what are you guys... like that's
your new thing right?"
586,CONNOR,586,"Yeah, well..."
587,ROCCO,587,"Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys
decide who you're... I mean, who
makes the cut? Is there a raffle or
something?"
588,MURPHY,588,"Well, truth be known, those first
ones just kinda fell into our laps."
589,ROCCO,589,"Well, what'ya do?"
590,CONNOR,590,"I guess we really don't have a system
of deciding who."
591,ROCCO,591,"MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know
everyone, their habits, where they
hang out, who they talk to. I know
where they fuckin' live. We could
kill everyone!"
592,MURPHY,592,So what do you think?
593,CONNOR,593,I'm strangely comfortable with it.
594,MURPHY,594,"Okay Roc, this is..."
595,ROCCO,595,What? You guys got masks.
596,MURPHY,596,"You look like Mush Mouth from Fat
Albert."
597,ROCCO,597,"Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she
can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin'
to be professional, but no..."
598,CONNOR,598,"No. No. It looks good. C'mon, put it
back on. It's good."
599,CONNOR,599,Okay Roc. You sure you're O-B-kay-B?
600,ROCCO,600,Which one is he in?
601,ROCCO,601,What's his routine?
602,DANCER,602,"H... h... he jerks off in there.
Th... then he puts money through the
slot and I raise the door."
603,MURPHY,603,How?
604,ROCCO,604,Then what?
605,DANCER,605,"He watches me do my thing and f-
finishes himself off."
606,VINCENZO,606,"Don't you talk to me like that, you
dirty little... give it to daddy...
give it ta da King... garbage mouth,
garbage mouth."
607,ROCCO,607,Oh man. He is some sicko.
608,CONNOR,608,You've earned this.
609,CONNOR,609,What the fuck are you doing?
610,ROCCO,610,I-I'll tip her.
611,MURPHY,611,We've teamed up with a sex offender.
612,CONNOR,612,"So, when are you getting a plastic
fuck doll?"
613,ROCCO,613,All right. I'm sorry. I'm pathetic.
614,ROCCO,614,What? What is it?
615,CONNOR,615,"This place is like a scumbag yard
sale."
616,MURPHY,616,"We gotta come down here once a week
and clean house."
617,ROCCO,617,You sure about this guy?
618,ROCCO,618,"Oh man. You gotta let me do these
guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make
up for the tit thing."
619,CONNOR,619,"No way. I've been waitin' for this
asshole."
620,ROCCO,620,"Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family
name here. I've brought shame to the
house of Della Rocco."
621,MURPHY,621,Give the guy a shot.
622,CONNOR,622,"Rocco, this is the real deal. We
must kill without hesitation, without
guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead
man."
623,ROCCO,623,"Wyatt-fuckin'-Earp, man!"
624,ROCCO,624,"You guys gotta teach me that prayer,
man. That's some good shit."
625,CONNOR,625,"Forget it. It's a family prayer. My
father, his father before him that
sort of shit."
626,ROCCO,626,C'mon!
627,AUGUSTUS,627,Fuck you.
628,YAKAVETTA,628,"Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I
got a serious problem here. I'm not
screwing around."
629,AUGUSTUS,629,"I bounced you on my knee at family
reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad
and me ran the whole east coast
syndicate you snot-nosed little prick.
And when you took the wheel, who was
beside you?"
630,YAKAVETTA,630,"Hey, I just..."
631,AUGUSTUS,631,"Don't start with your shit. Don't
you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy,
thanks for years of service. Here's
a gold watch and a job sniffing other
guys' shit eight hours a day. What
am I, a retired bus driver?"
632,YAKAVETTA,632,I need Il Duce.
633,AUGUSTUS,633,The Duke?
634,AUGUSTUS,634,What did you do?
635,YAKAVETTA,635,"This kid, this package boy could
bring down the whole east coast. If
he decides to turn states he could
dismantle us... totally. But it looks
like for now, he's content with just
killing us one by one. And even worse
the kid is good at it. I mean I had
a prodigy on my hands the whole time
and didn't even know it."
636,AUGUSTUS,636,"Listen kid, I think you better
understand who you're dealing with
here."
637,YAKAVETTA,637,"Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen
when you guys used to talk about
him, like he was a ghost or something."
638,AUGUSTUS,638,"Your dad and I used him three times
over twenty years, only when
everything went totally fucked.
Believe me kid, you don't want this
guy unless you are 100% sure you
need him. He is... a fuckin' monster."
639,MR. COBB,639,"Do you feel you have been
rehabilitated?"
640,AUGUSTUS,640,"I've had this guy in front of me,
and I couldn't tell you what he looks
like, sounds like. He is the Picasso
of assassins, kid. He plants hair
samples, blood. Puts skin under
fingernails. He is a fucking genius.
Only one problem. He's been rotting
in prison for twenty-five or thirty
years. Don't even know if he's still
alive. Or if he's even up to it."
641,YAKAVETTA,641,There's ways around that.
642,AUGUSTUS,642,Go find one.
643,ROCCO,643,"Let's talk some business here. I
know a sick fuck... makes the ones
we been doing look like altar boys.
Worst night of my life when I met
this guy."
644,ROCCO,644,"The guy never says a fuckin' word to
me. We're driving for 25 minutes.
Never a sigh, no throat clearing,
nothing. And his face, blank man.
Just nothing there."
645,ROCCO,645,"I didn't see what he was doing while
he was in there."
646,THE MAN,646,"I have a poker game at the house
every Saturday with a couple of guys
you know. Why don't you come down?
Wife makes a hell of a bar-g-que."
647,ROCCO,647,"Yeah... yeah, I'd like that. Tell me
something. What did they do?"
648,THE MAN,648,I don't know.
649,ROCCO,649,"Worst day of my life, man."
650,MURPHY,650,"Well, I'm sold."
651,CONNOR,651,"Don't worry, Roc. We'll do this guy
right and you'll feel a lot better."
652,CONNOR,652,"Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know
you fuckin' know!"
653,ROCCO,653,"Fuck you! I told you I never saw him
before!"
654,MURPHY,654,Well he sure as fuck knew you!
655,ROCCO,655,"Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was
aiming at you!"
656,SMECKER,656,Okay. Here's what happened.
657,SMECKER,657,"They waited in a parked car down the
street for the kid to leave."
658,MURPHY,658,There he goes.
659,MURPHY,659,"Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to
bring this man into the light? Are
we ready to truly do the work of the
Lord?"
660,CONNOR,660,A-fuckin'-men!
661,ROCCO,661,This is so fuckin' cool!
662,SMECKER,662,"They went in through the garage. The
kid says he leaves it open when he
takes his bike out."
663,SMECKER (V.O.),663,"Now, they know the wife is the gate
keeper. She knows the code."
664,ROCCO,664,"Don't fuck with me lady. I'll kill
you."
665,SMECKER,665,"The wife says she doesn't know what
happened after she hit the code. She
just remembers going down. But,
judging by the burn mark on her back,
I think what they did..."
666,SMECKER,666,...was use a stun gun on her.
667,SMECKER,667,"Now the guy knows a friend is coming
to the game. And they know that this
door can only be opened from the
inside. So they wait... and when
that door opens, man..."
668,ROCCO,668,All of them.
669,SMECKER,669,"Nobody was ready for it. Devastation,
panic! This was like shooting fish
in a fuckin' barrel!"
670,SMECKER,670,"Now these guys dove under the table.
The trajectory on the bullets show
they came from straight across. So
this means one of our shooters...
dropped to his knees..."
671,ROCCO,671,Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
672,MURPHY,672,What the fuck do you mean?
673,ROCCO,673,I mean he ain't here.
674,CONNOR,674,Look again for fuck sake!
675,ROCCO,675,I know what the fuck he looks like!
676,SMECKER,676,Something went wrong. Right here.
677,CONNOR,677,Let the boy go!
678,MURPHY,678,C'mon Roc!
679,SMECKER,679,"Now, one of these guys is a real
sicko. He knew this man. He wanted
him to suffer, to feel every second
of a painful death."
680,ROCCO,680,Help me you assholes!
681,ROCCO,681,He's gonna fuckin' kill me!
682,SMECKER,682,This guy is one bad motherfucker.
683,ROCCO,683,I don't wanna die!!!!!
684,SMECKER,684,"I've never seen wounds like these
before, but whatever he used on this
guy, it was a blunt object and they
took it with them."
685,SMECKER,685,"They exited out the front door. And
they had no fucking idea what they
were in for."
686,SMECKER,686,"Now they are staring at six guys
with guns drawn. It was a fucking
ambush."
687,SMECKER,687,"And this was a fucking bomb dropping
in Beaver Cleaverville! For a few
seconds this place was Armageddon!
There was a fire fight!"
688,IL DUCE,688,No!... No! No!...
689,GREENLY,689,"What if it was just one guy with six
guns?"
690,SMECKER,690,"Why don't you let me do the thinking,
huh, genius?"
691,SMECKER,691,"What is taking so long with those
blood samples?"
692,FORENSICS WOMAN #1,692,"I can't get a good sample. There is
variable here I'm not seeing."
693,SMECKER,693,"They used ammonia... none of this
shit is any good... Fuck... You know
what this means?! Even if we get
suspects in this case, we got
nothing... Nothing!"
694,SMECKER,694,"Who the fuck are they?! I've never
seen any-fucking-thing like this in
my whole fucking life. Who the fuck
are they?!!"
695,DUFFY,695,What? That's it?!
696,CONNOR,696,Shit.
697,ROCCO,697,What?
698,ROCCO,698,"What, that guy?"
699,MURPHY,699,"That's the guy that got us off the
hook with the ""Checkov"" thing."
700,CONNOR,700,And he is one smart man.
701,ROCCO,701,They got nothing.
702,CONNOR,702,"This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't
figured us out yet, he will."
703,MURPHY,703,You bet your ass he will.
704,ROCCO,704,"Well, I'd say that makes him a lia-
fuckin-bility."
705,CONNOR,705,He isn't to be touched.
706,MURPHY,706,He's a good man.
707,ROCCO,707,Okay... whatever.
708,ROCCO,708,My Mom's gonna kill me.
709,SMECKER,709,"No. This is all wrong. David Della
Rocco?"
710,MARIA (V.O.),710,Boston Police Department.
711,SMECKER,711,"Yeah. Maria, this is Smecker. Could
you find me the visitor's list for
the day the MacManus brothers were
in and read me all the names?"
712,SMECKER,712,"Okay, thank you."
713,BARTENDER,713,"You've had quite a bit, Paul. Are
you sure you..."
714,SMECKER,714,"Pour the drink, faggot-ass!"
715,SMECKER,715,Okay... But I don't cuddle.
716,ROCCO,716,"Hey! We gotta talk about this early
morning church shit."
717,MURPHY,717,We have to go now.
718,MURPHY,718,We're on the lamb.
719,ROCCO,719,"You gonna do what I say, got it?"
720,PRIEST,720,Yes.
721,ROCCO,721,"I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see
this. Don't look at me!"
722,PRIEST,722,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see."
723,ROCCO,723,Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
724,PRIEST,724,Don't do this my son.
725,ROCCO,725,Open it!
726,PRIEST,726,Have you no fear of God?
727,ROCCO,727,"That's who I'm doing this for, now
open the fuckin' thing."
728,ROCCO,728,"Father, I'll do you right here."
729,PRIEST,729,God have mercy on my soul.
730,CONNOR,730,"You little fuck. Let him go. I'll
drop you right here."
731,ROCCO,731,"Okay, just calm down. He could hurt
us, brother. He could ruin the whole
thing."
732,CONNOR,732,"Let him go or I will deliver you,
right now."
733,ROCCO,733,"You won't do it Connor, you won't.
You love me man."
734,SMECKER,734,Hello? You there?
735,PRIEST,735,Y-Yes my son.
736,ROCCO,736,"Do your thing Father. Don't fuck
this up."
737,PRIEST,737,What do you want me to say?
738,ROCCO,738,"Just be natural, goddamit."
739,PRIEST,739,"How long since your last confession,
my son?"
740,SMECKER,740,"Oh, Christ, uh, I've never confessed."
741,SMECKER,741,"According to the dogma of the Catholic
church, I should probably burst into
flames right here in this booth. But
I've come here for advice, not
salvation."
742,PRIEST,742,"Why have you come to a church for
council if you're not religious?"
743,SMECKER,743,"Why have I come to a church? I never
have before. I guess I just... felt
I should."
744,PRIEST,744,What is it my son?
745,SMECKER,745,"It's ethics. I put evil men behind
bars, but the law has miles of red
tape and loopholes for these...
cocksuckers to slip through. I've
found out there are these two young
men who fix the situation with an
iron fist. As if they have God's
permission. But what they do is wrong
and I should arrest them...
technically."
746,PRIEST,746,God's permission? God doesn't...
747,SMECKER,747,"But in this day and age I believe
what they do is... necessary. I feel
it is... correct."
748,PRIEST,748,You believe?
749,SMECKER,749,Yes.
750,PRIEST,750,You feel?
751,SMECKER,751,Yes.
752,PRIEST,752,"You feel? A soul is what gives you
feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or
wrong. It is a conduit through which
the Lord speaks to us. You felt that
your answers would be here in the
house of God today. You feel these
men are necessary. The Lord has spoken
to you twice this day."
753,SMECKER,753,Has he now?
754,PRIEST,754,"You have entered the house of the
Lord of your own free will speaking
of beliefs and feelings. Is it so
much to believe that God has brought
you here?"
755,SMECKER,755,I guess not.
756,PRIEST,756,"It is easy to be sarcastic about
religion. It is harder to take small
hints from God, your feelings and
listen to them... to take a stand."
757,SMECKER,757,You're right.
758,PRIEST,758,"Those who do not act are in a constant
state of ethical indecision."
759,SMECKER,759,"I want to stand for what I believe
in, father."
760,PRIEST,760,"Then you must find out what your
beliefs are."
761,SMECKER,761,I believe these young men are right.
762,PRIEST,762,You know them personally?
763,SMECKER,763,Yes.
764,PRIEST,764,"Do you think they would harm an
innocent man, for any reason?"
765,SMECKER,765,No. They would never do that.
766,SMECKER,766,"Well, the two Irish guys wouldn't.
But the Italian guy, he might. He's
kind of an idiot."
767,ROCCO,767,"Goddam right, I am."
768,SMECKER,768,"I'm beginning to see. I've been doing
my job... well for fifteen years and
it's just not enough. All the things
I wish I could do, these guys are
doing. Millions of dollars in tax
payers' money wasted on shit like
wire taps and surveillance. Theses
boys go in and take care of it for
the price of a bullet."
769,SMECKER,769,"Ww-what do you think I should do?
Because I'm a law man."
770,PRIEST,770,"The laws of God are higher than the
laws of man."
771,SMECKER,771,"Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too.
No. I was feeling it. All I needed
was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll
help them."
772,PRIEST,772,Forgive me father.
773,SMECKER,773,"Thank you, Father, thank you."
774,SMECKER,774,"Whatever. Goodbye, amen."
775,ROCCO,775,"I wouldn't have, uh, killed you,
Father."
776,ROCCO,776,"Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're
bound. You can't talk about this...
to anyone."
777,PRIEST,777,Just go!
778,ROCCO,778,The Lord works in mysterious ways.
779,SMECKER,779,That's all you can give me?
780,CONNOR,780,"Well, the light caught the side of
his face for a second. And it looked
like he had a gray beard, maybe...
late fifties, early sixties."
781,SMECKER,781,"So you're telling me it was one guy
with six guns? A-and he was a senior
fucking citizen?"
782,CONNOR,782,"I think it's better if we find this
man before he finds us again."
783,SMECKER,783,"I'll see what I can do. How do I get
in touch with you?"
784,CONNOR,784,"We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight,
right in the comfort of his own home.
Then we move on to New York. It's
getting a bit hot for us here."
785,SMECKER,785,Be careful.
786,CONNOR,786,"I'll call you tonight, afterwards."
787,AUGUSTUS,787,I don't know who he is. Nobody does.
788,SMECKER,788,What did he bring him in for?
789,AUGUSTUS,789,"Needed an outsider. The package boy
knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters
a mile away."
790,SMECKER,790,Just for him?
791,AUGUSTUS,791,"Well he's the one shooting up all
his guys, right? He's scared of the
kid. Says he's real good, got every
available gun in the city up there."
792,SMECKER,792,Up where?
793,AUGUSTUS,793,"Up his house. I don't know what's
going on but I know it's gotta have
something to do with this kid."
794,SMECKER,794,Oh fuck!
795,YAKAVETTA,795,"You gonna tell me what's going on
here?! Huh! You little fuck! Gimme
some answers!"
796,YAKAVETTA,796,What do you guys think?
797,GENO,797,"They're tough. No way they're gonna
talk."
798,HOJO,798,"I know Rocco. He ain't smart enough
for this shit. These other guys are
the brains. He's just a player."
799,YAKAVETTA,799,"There's only one way to get them to
talk."
800,ROCCO,800,You guys?
801,CONNOR,801,We're here brother.
802,ROCCO,802,You gotta keep going.
803,MURPHY,803,"We'll keep going, Roc."
804,ROCCO,804,"You'll make it outta here. You can't
ever stop, not ever."
805,CHAPPY,805,"Once you set him in motion, you can't
call him off. He thinks it's still
on."
806,YAKAVETTA,806,Oh Jesus Christ!
807,HOJO,807,What? I...
808,YAKAVETTA,808,"Hey, I don't have my name spray
painted on the front of this house.
There are no big pictures of me
anywhere. If this guy thinks the job
is still a go then I got green money
says the mother fucker's out in the
bushes already. I'm fucking gone!
I'm leaving you guys to deal with
this."
809,GENO,809,"One fucking guy, so what."
810,HOJO,810,Why don't you take the front.
811,HOJO,811,"You guys cover those other exits and
if you see him, don't flag him down,
just kill the mother fucker. I'm
going back down to work on these
pricks."
812,SMECKER AS WOMAN,812,"Joey Bevo sent me over. As
entertainment."
813,GENO,813,"Listen baby. Tonight ain't the night
for this shit."
814,GENO,814,"Bevo's so great. Always sending us
hot girls."
815,SMECKER,815,You look like you could use a quickie.
816,GENO,816,"Hey, Chappy!"
817,CHAPPY,817,What the fuck?
818,GENO,818,"I ain't been laid in a week. Take
five minutes."
819,CHAPPY,819,"If I die cause you're getting a piece
of ass, I'll come back and beat you
to death with a big rubber dick."
820,GENO,820,Don't worry about it.
821,CONNOR,821,"How far are we going with this, Da?"
822,FATHER,822,"The questions is not, ""how far?"" The
question is, ""Do you possess the
constitution, the depth of faith to
go as far as is needed?"""
823,MEDIA MAN 1,823,"Look at his charisma. He's the next
John Gotti."
824,MEDIA MAN 2,824,"He'll walk. Even with all this
evidence."
825,MEDIA MAN 1,825,Look.
826,MEDIA MAN 1,826,"All Yakavetta's people are on the
right. All the families of the men
he has killed are on the left.
Everyone wants some justice."
827,MEDIA MAN 2,827,"Look at him. He doesn't have a care
in the world. He's gonna walk."
828,FATHER,828,"How long do these put a man down
for?"
829,MURPHY,829,Ten minutes.
830,FATHER,830,Twenty is a bit better.
831,JUDGE,831,Due to the lack of hard evidence......
832,FATHER,832,"All media to the back! Drop the
cameras! Drop 'em!"
833,FATHER,833,"You people have been chosen to reveal
our existence to the world. You will
witness what happens here today and
you will tell of it afterwards."
834,YAKAVETTA,834,Fuckin' do something!
835,FATHER (WHISPERS),835,"You must watch dear. It'll all be
over soon."
836,CONNOR,836,"Now, you will receive us."
837,MURPHY,837,"We do not ask for your poor or your
hungry."
838,CONNOR,838,We do not want your tired and sick.
839,MURPHY,839,It is your corrupt we claim.
840,CONNOR,840,"It is your evil, who will be sought
by us."
841,MURPHY,841,"With every breath we shall hunt them
down."
842,CONNOR,842,"Each day we will spill their blood
till it rains down from the skies."
843,MURPHY,843,"Do not kill, do not rape, do not
steal. These are principles which
every man of every faith can embrace."
844,CONNOR,844,"These are not polite suggestions.
They are codes of behavior and those
that ignore them will pay the dearest
cost."
845,MURPHY,845,"There are varying degrees of evil.
We urge you lesser forms of filth"
846,MURPHY,846,"Not to push the bounds and cross
over into true corruption... into
our domain."
847,CONNOR,847,"For if you do, there will come the
day when you look behind you and see
we three. And on that day you will
reap it."
848,MURPHY,848,"And we will send you to whatever God
you wish."
849,REPORTER 2 (V.O.),849,"Yes! Were you in the courtroom miss?
Did you see?"
850,WOMAN (FRAIL),850,Yes. I was there.
851,REPORTER (V.O.),851,How do you feel about what they did?
852,WOMAN,852,"I guess we all know what is right
and wrong. We all know. Nobody needs
to be convinced of what he was...
I'm going home now to have my first
real full night's sleep."
