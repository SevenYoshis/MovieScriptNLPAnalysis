0,MAYOR (V.O.),0,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the future of Los Angeles!"
1,MAYOR,1,"The Arroyo Seco freeway is just
the beginning.  We're planning
freeways from Downtown to Santa
Monica, from the South Bay to the
San Fernando Valley.  Twenty
minutes to work or play is the
longest you'll have to travel."
2,REPORTER,2,"How many bodies you think Mickey
Cohen'll be able to hide in all
that cement?"
3,HUDGEONS (V.O.),3,"Meyer Harris Cohen, Mickey C to
his fans.  He's the big moocher,
local L.A. color to the nth
degree.  You know Mickey.  He runs
dope, rackets and prostitution.
He kills a dozen people a year.
But who you may not know is
bodyguard Johnny Stompanato."
4,HUDGEONS (V.O.),4,"Johnny's handsome, ladies, but the
real attraction is below the belt.
Second only to Steve Cochran, he's
sometimes known as 'Oscar' because
of his Academy Award-size
appendage."
5,HUDGEONS (V.O.),5,"Remember, dear readers, you heard
it here first, off the record, on
the Q.T. and very"
6,MAYOR,6,"We're selling an image, gentlemen.
Beautiful weather.  Affordable
housing."
7,MAYOR,7,"Trouble-free transportation.  And
the best police department in the
world to keep it all running
smoothly."
8,CHASE (V.O.),8,"My name?  Joe Reno.  The city?
Los Angeles.  A big town.  Full of
all sorts of people.  It's my job
to help them.  I like what I do.
I'm a cop."
9,MAYOR,9,"But with a second rate Al Capone
out there, L.A. looks like Chicago
in the '30s.  Something has to be
done."
10,POLICE OFFICER,10,"Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest."
11,COHEN,11,Bullshit.  What's the charge?
12,POLICE OFFICER,12,Non-payment of federal income tax.
13,REPORTER,13,"How's your bullshit now, Mickey?!"
14,LOEW,14,"Today is an auspicious one for the
city of Los Angeles.  Mickey Cohen
has just been sentenced to ten
years in federal prison for
failure to pay income tax.
As the District Attorney for Los
Angeles County, it is my pleasure
to declare our great city
organized crime free.  It is truly
the dawning of a new day."
15,STOMPANATO,15,"Officer White.  I heard you got a
hard-on for wife beaters."
16,BUD,16,"And you fuck people up for a
living.  That don't make me you."
17,STENSLAND,17,"Bud ain't in the mood for small
talk, Stompanato."
18,STOMPANATO,18,"Look, Mickey C's doing time and
half the other guys who'd hire me
are dead or left town.  I need
money.  If your snitch-fund's
green, I'll get you some fucking-A
collars."
19,STOMPANATO,19,"There's this guy.  He's blond and
fat, about forty.  Likes the
ponies.  Been pimping his wife to
cover his losses.  Knocks her
around to keep her in line."
20,STOMPANATO,20,"I figure the address is worth
twenty."
21,STOMPANATO,21,"Yuletide cheer, fellas."
22,BUD,22,"Happy New Year, greaseball."
23,STENSLAND,23,"Leave it for later, Bud.  We got
to pick up the rest of the booze
and get back to the precinct."
24,BUD,24,"Central, this is 4A-31.  Send a
prowler to 1486 Evergreen.  White
male in custody.  Code 623 point
one.  Domestic assault and
battery.  I won't be here, but
they'll see him."
25,BUD,25,"Touch her again and I'll know
about it.  Understand?  Huh?"
26,BUD,26,You got someplace you can go?
27,BUD,27,Go get yourself fixed up.
28,WIFE,28,"Merry Christmas, huh?"
29,STENSLAND,29,"You and women, partner.  What's
next?  Kids and dogs?"
30,ACTRESS,30,"Brett Chase told me you're the cop
who busted Bob Mitchum."
31,ACTRESS,31,"These 'Badge of Honor' guys like
to pretend, but being the real
thing must be a thrill."
32,JACK,32,"Let's go someplace quiet.  I'll
give you the low-down on Mitchum."
33,ACTRESS,33,You got your handcuffs with you?
34,JACK,34,Two sets.
35,ACTRESS,35,I'll get my coat.
36,HUDGEONS,36,"Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have
this dance?"
37,JACK,37,"Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from"
38,ACTRESS,38,I know who he is.
39,HUDGEONS,39,"We did a piece last year.
'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her
name got mentioned."
40,JACK,40,Is she?
41,HUDGEONS,41,"Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a
friend of mine just sold some
reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's
tripping the light fantastic with
Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla,
Hollywood Hills.  It's right
around the corner."
42,JACK,42,"You lost me, Sid.  Who?"
43,HUDGEONS,43,"Contract players at Metro.  You
pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in
the next issue.  Plus the usual
fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking
Santa Claus?"
44,JACK,44,"I need an extra fifty.  Two
patrolmen at twenty apiece and a
dime for the watch commander at
Hollywood Station."
45,HUDGEONS,45,Jack!  It's Christmas!
46,JACK,46,"No.  It's felony possession of
marijuana."
47,HUDGEONS,47,"They're sitting in the dark,
goofing on the Christmas tree."
48,JACK,48,"Stand there with your camera.
I'll stop here so you get
Grauman's Chinese in the
backgrouns."
49,HUDGEONS,49,I like it!  I like it!
50,JACK,50,Police!
51,HUDGEONS,51,Cut!  Wrap it!
52,HUDGEONS,52,"It's Christmas morning in the City
of Angels, and while decent
citizens sleep the sleep of the
righteous, hopheads prowl for
marijuana, not knowing that a man
is coming to stop them.  The free-
wheeling, big-time Big V,
celebrity crime-stopper, Jack
Vincennes, the scourge of
grasshoppers and junk fiends
everywhere.  You like it, Jackie-
Boy?"
53,JACK,53,"Yeah, it's subtle."
54,HUDGEONS,54,"Remember: you heard it first here,
off the record, on the Q.T. and
very"
55,EXLEY,55,What's on the call sheet?
56,YOUNG OFFICER,56,"A guy dressed as Santa has been
exposing himself to kids in Los
Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's
decorated himself."
57,EXLEY,57,Decorated?
58,YOUNG OFFICER,58,"With tinsel and plastic icicles
and... on his penis, sir."
59,EXLEY,59,"I get the idea.  You got a
description?"
60,YOUNG OFFICER,60,"Of his penis, sir?"
61,LYNN,61,"A case each of gin, Scotch, and
rum.  Everything top shelf.  None
of that watered-down stuff you
push on Errol Flynn."
62,OWNER,62,Sounds like a helluva party.
63,OWNER,63,You want it delivered?
64,LYNN,64,Before five tomorrow.
65,OWNER,65,"I'll be right with you, Lynn."
66,BUD,66,Merry Christmas.
67,LYNN,67,"Merry Christmas yourself,"
68,BUD,68,"That obvious, huh?"
69,LYNN,69,"It's practically stamped on your
forehead."
70,MEEKS,70,Get lost why don't you?
71,MEEKS,71,I got a license for that.
72,MEEKS,72,"Cut me some slack.  I used to be a
cop."
73,BUD,73,Turner Meeks?  Never heard of you.
74,LYNN,74,We just call him Buzz.
75,BUD,75,You okay?
76,PATCHETT,76,She's fine.
77,BUD,77,I'm not asking you.
78,BUD,78,Somebody hit you?
79,LYNN,79,It's not what you think.
80,BUD,80,What is it then?
81,SUSAN,81,"You got the wrong idea, Mister.
I'm fine."
82,LYNN,82,But it's nice to know you care.
83,STENSLAND,83,What's going on?
84,BUD,84,You know him?
85,STENSLAND,85,"Seen him around.  He used to be a
cop."
86,REPORTER,86,"Captain Smith, I --"
87,DUDLEY,87,"Drop the formalities; it's
Christmas Eve.  Call me Dudley."
88,REPORTER,88,"Dudley, I came up with a title for
the story.  I'm calling it ""Silent
Night with the L.A.P.D."""
89,DUDLEY,89,Excellent.  How's this?
90,DUDLEY,90,"The sanctity of the night is an
invitation to the darker criminal
element.  Our vigilance will not
be diminished."
91,DUDLEY,91,That's Smith with an S.
92,DUDLEY,92,"This way, gentlemen."
93,YOUNG OFFICER,93,"Two police officers were assaulted
in a bar.  Brown and Helenowski."
94,DUDLEY,94,"This is Sergeant Ed Exley.  Son of
the legendary Preston Exley.  He's
the watch commander tonight and a
damn fine job."
95,DUDLEY,95,"I was fortunate enough to be
partnered with his father when I
was a rookie.  It makes a man feel
old.  That's a fact."
96,DUDLEY,96,"Feel free to get a feel for the
place."
97,DUDLEY,97,"A word with you, lad."
98,DUDLEY,98,To the memory of your father.
99,DUDLEY,99,"The day he got the Medal of Valor.
A simpler time."
100,EXLEY,100,"To the solving of crimes that
require absolute justice."
101,DUDLEY,101,That was his favorite toast.
102,DUDLEY,102,"I saw the test results on the
lieutenant's exam.  You placed
first out of twenty-three."
103,EXLEY,103,"The youngest applicant by eight
years."
104,DUDLEY,104,"You'll make lieutenant inside a
year.  Patrol division?"
105,EXLEY,105,I was thinking Detective Bureau.
106,DUDLEY,106,"You don't have the eye for human
weakness to be a good detective.
Or the stomach.  You're a
political animal, Edmund."
107,EXLEY,107,You're wrong.
108,DUDLEY,108,"Am I...?  Would you be willing to
plant corroborative evidence on a
suspect you knew was guilty in
order to ensure an indictment?"
109,EXLEY,109,"Dudley, we've been over this."
110,DUDLEY,110,Answer yes or no.
111,EXLEY,111,I... No.
112,DUDLEY,112,"Would you be willing to rig crime
scene evidence to support a
prosecuting attorney's working
hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund."
113,EXLEY,113,No.
114,DUDLEY,114,"Would you be willing to beat
confessions out of suspects you
knew to be guilty?"
115,EXLEY,115,No.
116,DUDLEY,116,"Would you be willing to shoot
hardened criminals in the back to
offset the chance --"
117,EXLEY,117,No.
118,DUDLEY,118,"Then for God's sake, don't be a
detective.  Stick to assignments
where you won't have to make those
choices.  Patrol, Internal
Affairs, but not the Bureau."
119,EXLEY,119,"I know you mean well, Dudley, but
I don't need to do it the way you
did.  Or my father."
120,DUDLEY,120,"At least get rid of the glasses.
I can't think of one Bureau man
who wears them."
121,STENSLAND,121,"Hey, partner.  Grab a cup."
122,BUD,122,I got to write my report first.
123,PASSING COP #1,123,"Hear about Helenowski and Brown?
They got into a helluva scrap with
six taco benders at some bar.
Helenowski lost six pints of
blood.  Brown's in a coma."
124,PASSING COP #2,124,"We ought to teach Paco and his
friends a lesson."
125,WOMAN (V.O.),125,Whatever you desire.
126,JACK,126,"Hi... I'd like to get a delivery
to Beverly Hills."
127,WOMAN (V.O.),127,I don't think I know you.
128,WOMAN (V.O.),128,Whatever you desire.
129,JACK,129,"Look, a friend of mine gave me
this number.  I just --"
130,OPERATOR (V.O.),130,Pacific Coast Bell.
131,JACK,131,"This is Sgt. Vincennes.
Requesting a name and address on a
phone number.  Hollywood zero-one-
two-three-nine."
132,OPERATOR (V.O.),132,"Please hold the line... No such
number is assigned."
133,JACK,133,I just called it.
134,OPERATOR (V.O.),134,"No, Sergeant.  I checked twice."
135,JACK,135,A bootleg...
136,EXLEY,136,"All right, men.  You've had your
fun.  Time to break it up."
137,STENSLAND,137,"Fucking Exley.  Guy's got a pole
so far up his ass, every time he
farts the flag waves."
138,EXLEY,138,What's going on?
139,COP,139,"They got the spics who japped
Helenowski and Brown.  Helenowski
lost an eye and Brown's got brain
damage."
140,EXLEY,140,"I have the report right here.
They're home with bruises and
muscle pulls -- Oh shit..."
141,STENSLAND,141,"For ours, Pancho. And you're
getting off easy."
142,JACK,142,"White, you better get a lease on
Stens before he kills someone."
143,GARCIA,143,"Fuck you,"
144,BUD,144,Yeah yeah...
145,GARCIA,145,And fuck your mother too.
146,EXLEY,146,"Stop, Officer!  That's an order!"
147,EXLEY,147,"You're going in my report!  All of
you!"
148,EXLEY (V.O.),148,Let me out!  That's an order!
149,CHIEF,149,"Officer White, you've refused to
cooperate with Internal Affairs.
But you should know this is bigger
than a police board.  Indictments
may be handed down.  Quite
frankly, we need police witnesses
to offset the damage done to the
Department's image.  Will you
testify?"
150,BUD,150,"No, sir.  I won't."
151,CHIEF,151,District Attorney Loew.
152,LOEW,152,"Bloody Christmas.  The press love
to label.  You and Officer
Stensland brought the liquor into
the precinct.  Stensland was
already drunk.  Do you see how
appearing as a voluntary witness
against him could offset the
damage you've done to yourself?"
153,BUD,153,I won't do it.
154,BUD,154,"I won't testify against my partner
or anyone else."
155,LOEW,155,This man is a disgrace.
156,CHIEF,156,"Your badge and gun, Officer."
157,CHIEF,157,"This is the new L.A.P.D., White.
You're suspended from duty and
dismissed."
158,CHIEF,158,"Ed, your observations have been
astute.  What's your assessment of
this situation?"
159,EXLEY,159,"The public demands justice, sir.
This was a full-fledged riot of
policemen.  Shift the guilt to men
whose pensions are secured.  Force
them to retire.  But someone has
to swing.  Indict, try and convict
Stensland and Bud White.  Secure
them jail time.  Feed them to the
sharks, sir.  Protect yourself;
protect the department."
160,DUDLEY,160,"Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight
D fitness reports from every C.O.
he ever served under.  But White
is a valuable officer."
161,EXLEY,161,White's a mindless thug.
162,DUDLEY,162,"No, Edmund.  He's a man who can
answer yes to those questions I
ask you from time to time."
163,CHIEF,163,"I want to know who we give the
public in contrast?  The
department needs role models.
Clean-cut,"
164,CHIEF,164,public can admire.
165,EXLEY,165,"I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid
to do what's right."
166,CHIEF,166,"And I'll promote you.  You'll be a
lieutenant immediately."
167,CHIEF,167,"Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't
make lieutenant until he was 33."
168,EXLEY,168,"I know that, sir.  I also know
that when he made lieutenant, it
was as a detective."
169,LOEW,169,"Before we start polishing our
laurels, it would look better if
we had a corroborative witness."
170,DUDLEY,170,"That'll be hard to come by.  The
men hate a turncoat."
171,EXLEY,171,"Jack Vincennes.  He's the
technical advisor on 'Badge of
Honor,' sir.  He lives for it.
That's the way to get him."
172,CHIEF,172,"All right, Ed."
173,CHIEF,173,Call Sergeant Vincennes.
174,DUDLEY,174,"You'll reap the benefits, but are
you truly prepared to be despised
within the department?"
175,EXLEY,175,"Yes, Dudley.  I am."
176,DUDLEY,176,So be it.
177,DUDLEY,177,"Sergeant, we'll get right to it.
Nine civilian witnesses have
identified you as hitting Ezekiel
Garcia."
178,LOEW,178,"But my office has a stellar
witness who will tell the grand
jury that you hit back only after
being hit."
179,JACK,179,What do I have to do?
180,LOEW,180,"Testify against the three officers
who have already earned their
pensions.  Our key witness will
testify roundly, but you can plead
ignorance to questions directed at
the other men."
181,CHIEF,181,"I'll guarantee you a slap on the
wrist.  A brief suspension
followed by a temporary transfer
from Narcotics to Ad Vice."
182,CHIEF,182,"When you transfer out of Vice,
you'll be back on the show."
183,JACK,183,"The show, sir?"
184,CHIEF,184,"Badge of Honor, Vincennes.  We
need to tone down your profile for
a bit."
185,DUDLEY,185,"John, I doubt you've ever drawn a
stupid breath.  Don't start now."
186,JACK,186,Okay.  I'll do it.
187,CHIEF,187,"Dismissed, Vincennes."
188,CHIEF,188,So be it.
189,CHIEF,189,"Ace them at the grand jury
tomorrow, son.  Wear the smart-
looking suit and ace them.  And,
Ed?  Lose the glasses."
190,JACK,190,You're the key witness?
191,EXLEY,191,That's right.
192,JACK,192,"I should've known.  What's the
Chief throwing you?"
193,JACK,193,"Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?"
194,EXLEY,194,"You're the payoff expert.  I'm
just doing my duty."
195,JACK,195,"You're playing an angle, college
boy.  You're getting something out
of this so you don't have to
hobnob with the fucking rank and
file cops who'll hate your guts
for snitching.  If they're making
you a detective, watch out.  Some
Bureau guys are gonna burn in this
and you're gonna have to work with
friends of theirs."
196,EXLEY,196,What about you?
197,JACK,197,"I'm snitching three old timers
who'll be fishing in Oregon next
week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And
smart."
198,CLERK,198,Edmund J. Exley to chambers.
199,JACK,199,"Just remember, Bud White'll fuck
you for this if it takes the rest
of his life.  They already
suspended him.  Just pray he cops
a deal and stays on the Department
because that is one civilian you
do not want on your case."
200,BUD,200,"That an old fashioned you're
drinking?"
201,BUD,201,My name's Bud.
202,REDHEAD,202,Nobody was born with the name Bud.
203,BUD,203,"They stick you with a name like
Wendell, you look for an alias."
204,REDHEAD,204,"What do you do, Bud?"
205,BUD,205,"I'm sorta between jobs.  Look,
what do you say we, uh..."
206,DUDLEY,206,"Lad, may I have a word with you?"
207,BUD,207,"This business, Captain?"
208,DUDLEY,208,"Say goodnight to your friend and
join me by those back tables."
209,BUD,209,"Does that paper say we've been
indicted?  Does it say Exley's a
hero for squealing me and
Stensland off?"
210,DUDLEY,210,"He made his play amd he got what
he wanted.  They're making him a
detective."
211,BUD,211,"Captain, what do you want?"
212,DUDLEY,212,Call me Dudley.
213,BUD,213,"Dudley, what do you want?"
214,DUDLEY,214,"Lad, I admire your refusal to
testify and your loyalty to your
partner.  I admire you as a
policeman, particularly your
adherence to violence as a
necessary adjutant to the job.
And I am most impressed with your
punishment of wife beaters.  Do
you hate them, Wendell?"
215,BUD,215,"Yeah, I hate them."
216,DUDLEY,216,"And for good reason judging from
what I know of your background."
217,BUD,217,"What's going to happen to
Stensland?  He'll give himself
cirrhosis over this."
218,DUDLEY,218,"It would've happened years ago if
you hadn't carried him.  Why the
loyalty, Wendell?"
219,BUD,219,He helped me out once.  That's all.
220,DUDLEY,220,"Your partner's through.
Department scapegoat on the
Chief's orders.  He's been billed,
he'll be indicted and he'll swing."
221,BUD,221,Him and me both.
222,DUDLEY,222,"Don't underestimate his skills.
As a politician he exceeds even
myself.  But the department needs
smart men like Exley and... direct
men like yourself"
223,DUDLEY,223,"Wendell, I want you to come to
work for me."
224,BUD,224,"Doing what?  Mowing your fucking
lawn?"
225,DUDLEY,225,They're yours.  Take them.
226,BUD,226,"I knew you had juice, but...
There's no goddamn bill on me?"
227,DUDLEY,227,"Four of the defendants recanted
their testimony."
228,BUD,228,How?
229,DUDLEY,229,"I need you for an assignment the
Chief's given me the go-ahead on.
A duty few men are fit for, but
you were born for.  You'll be
working out of Homicide."
230,BUD,230,Homicide?  A detective?
231,CHIEF,231,"Your talents lie elsewhere,
Wendell.  It's a muscle job and
shooting job.  You'll do what I
say and not ask questions.  Do you
follow my drift?"
232,BUD,232,In Technicolor.
233,DUDLEY,233,Will you work for me?
234,BUD,234,Of course... But how?
235,DUDLEY,235,"How what, Wendell?"
236,BUD,236,How'd you get them to retract?
237,14-YEAR-OLD,237,Why'd you become a policeman?
238,CHASE,238,"I'm not a policeman.  I just play
one on television.  But I think I
can answer for them.  To help
people.  That's why I do the show."
239,CHASE,239,"To protect and serve.  It's not
just a motto."
240,CHASE,240,That one.  In the sweater.
241,CHASE,241,"They also serve who only stand and
wait."
242,CHASE,242,"Jack, I'll see you Monday on set."
243,JACK,243,"I won't be there.  They're toning
down my profile."
244,BUD,244,Domestic.  Assault and battery.
245,CARLISLE,245,"Ready to go, Bud?"
246,BUD,246,I'll be there in five minutes.
247,BUD,247,I hear you like to hit women.
248,PRISONER,248,"My wife.  She's dropping charges
so it's none of your business."
249,COHEN,249,"What do you mean Deuce Perkins got
clipped last night?!"
250,STOMPANATO,250,They shot him in his library.
251,COHEN,251,"I don't want a floor plan; I want
to know who!  Who's taking the
ticket for this, Johnny?"
252,STOMPANATO,252,Nobody.  At least not yet.
253,COHEN,253,"And what about the merchandise
Deuce was holding for me?"
254,STOMPANATO,254,Gone.  Not a trace.
255,COHEN,255,"Some ferstunkener is moving in and
we don't know who?!  Maybe we
should ask Hedda Hopper!"
256,VICE CAPTAIN,256,"Picture-book smut, gentlemen.
There's been a bunch of it found
at collateral crime scenes lately.
Mostly narcotics and prostitution
collars."
257,VICE CAPTAIN,257,"Look who's back from suspension.
We're honored, Sergeant Jack."
258,JACK,258,"Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book
Caper of 1953."
259,VICE CAPTAIN,259,"Vincennes, is there someplace
you'd rather be?"
260,JACK,260,"Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics."
261,VICE CAPTAIN,261,Oh?  Anyplace else?
262,JACK,262,Working whores with squad two.
263,VICE CAPTAIN,263,"Maybe you should have thought of
that before you made Bloody
Christmas page one."
264,VICE CAPTAIN,264,"They're yours.  Make a major case,
Sergeant.  It's the only way
you're getting out of here."
265,VICE CAPTAIN,265,"Dismissed, gentlemen."
266,VICE CAPTAIN,266,"Roll, Vincennes.  No sidetracks.
This is Ad Vice, not Narco."
267,HUDGEONS,267,the Q.T.
268,JACK (V.O.),268,"Sid, it's Vincennes."
269,HUDGEONS,269,"Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I
need copy."
270,JACK,270,"No.  But I've got something going
with Ad Vice."
271,HUDGEONS,271,Something good?
272,JACK,272,"Don't know.  I'm chasing picture
books.  Fuck shots, but the posers
don't look like junkies.  It's
well done stuff.  I thought you
might have heard something."
273,HUDGEONS,273,Not a word.
274,JACK,274,"What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their
slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'"
275,HUDGEONS,275,"No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack,
I'll talk to you later.  Call me
when you get something I can use.
Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks
who can't get their ashes hauled"
276,DISPATCHER (V.O.),276,"Park Rangers report three Negro
youths discharging shotguns into
the air in Griffith Park.
Suspects are driving a late model
purple Mercury Coupe."
277,EXLEY,277,"You're just a thug, White.  That's
all you'll ever be."
278,DUDLEY,278,"You should stay away from a man
when his blood is up."
279,EXLEY,279,His blood's always up.
280,DUDLEY,280,"Then maybe you should stay away
from him all the time."
281,STENSLAND,281,"Don't look so down in the mouth,
Bud.  You nailed him good."
282,BUD,282,"Yeah, sure... I got a couple of
hours before I have to be at the
Victory.  Want to grab a beer?"
283,STENSLAND,283,"Rain check me, partner.  I got
something big going on tonight."
284,BUD,284,"What?  That new mystery girl
you've been seeing?"
285,STENSLAND,285,"No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not
now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But
it could take the edge off that
jail time I got coming."
286,BUD,286,What are you talking about?
287,STENSLAND,287,"It's confidential, Bud.  Like that
magazines Vincennes scams for."
288,STENSLAND,288,"I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey,
if it works out, you'll get a
piece of it."
289,VOICE,289,"Squad call!  Nite Owl Coffee Shop
One-eight-one-two-four Cherokee!
Multiple homicides!  Multiple
homicides!  Code three!"
290,PATROLMAN #1,290,"Loads of people down.  Men.
Women.  I stopped for coffee --"
291,ROOKIE (O.S.),291,Holy shit fuck...
292,ROOKIE,292,"S-s-sir, there's a captain outside
wants to see you."
293,EXLEY,293,Don't get sick!  Not in here!
294,EXLEY,294,"Sir, I took the call.  It's my
case."
295,DUDLEY,295,"Edmund, you don't want it and you
can't have it."
296,EXLEY,296,"Yes, I do, sir."
297,DUDLEY,297,"It's mine.  I'll make you my
second in command."
298,PINKER,298,"We got a total of forty-five spent
12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.
Three men with five-shot-capacity
pumps.  All of them reloading
twice."
299,EXLEY,299,"Hold on... We need to canvass.
See if a purple Mercury was seen
around here tonight."
300,DUDLEY,300,Why?
301,EXLEY,301,"We got a call earlier on three
Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in
Griffith Park from a late-model
purple Mercury Coupe."
302,DUDLEY,302,Get on it.
303,FORENSICS COP,303,"We got an I.D. on one of the
victims, sir... I think it's Dick
Stensland."
304,DUDLEY,304,"With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los
Angeles is organized crime free.
The Chief wants it to stay that
way, Edmund.  The means are not
for the weak-hearted."
305,DUDLEY,305,"Come, Wendell, you can do better
than that."
306,FLATNOSE,306,"I know things.  I hear things.
Like with the Mick inside, things
are on this weird slowdown."
307,"(MORE)
FLATNOSE (CONT'D)",307,"These shooter teams, bang bang
bang, they're 86-ing Mickey
Cohen's men."
308,DUDLEY,308,"We know all that, lad.  Tell us,
who do these shooters work for?"
309,FLATNOSE,309,"I don't know.  No one knows.
Maybe they're mavericks.  You want
a prostie roust?  Huh?  Some narco
action?"
310,FLATNOSE,310,What do you want?!
311,DUDLEY,311,We want you to go home.
312,DUDLEY,312,"Uncuff him, Michael."
313,DUDLEY,313,"Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark
from San Francisco.  He arrived
this afternoon at Union Station.
Looking for business opportunities
in our fair city.  An organized
crime associate in need of re-
education in the ways of polite
society."
314,FLATNOSE,314,Motherfuckers!
315,DUDLEY,315,"It's part of the play, Edmund.  A
sincerity test."
316,DUDLEY,316,Sit him back down.
317,DUDLEY,317,"Wendell, you need to accompany
Detective Lieutenant Exley on
official police business.  I'll
finish up here."
318,BUD,318,Where are we going?
319,EXLEY,319,"It's a surprise.  You like
surprises, don't you, White?"
320,CORONER,320,"Call me crazy, but for a second I
thought it was Rita Hayworth."
321,EXLEY,321,"We need you to I.D. the body.
There's no next of kin and you
knew him best.  So tell me..."
322,EXLEY,322,Is that Dick Stensland?
323,BUD,323,"Yeah, that's Stens."
324,EXLEY,324,"Hell of a way to avoid a prison
sentence."
325,BUD,325,What happened?
326,EXLEY,326,"Someone held up a coffee shop,
panicked and killed six people."
327,WOMAN (O.S.),327,Not my baby!  Not my little girl!
328,CORONER,328,"Is this your daughter, Mrs.
Lefferts?"
329,MRS. LEFFERTS,329,I -- I don't know.
330,EXLEY,330,"We know this is difficult.  Just
take your time and look again."
331,MRS. LEFFERTS,331,"It seems like my Susan, but..."
332,EXLEY,332,"When was the last time you saw
her, Mrs. Lefferts?"
333,MRS. LEFFERTS,333,"At Christmas.  We had fought.  I
didn't like her boyfriend.  I --
she has a birthmark on her hip."
334,MRS. LEFFERTS,334,It's her.  My baby.  Dear God...
335,DUDLEY,335,"'Nite Owl Massacre.'  Hyperbole
aside, this is a heinous crime
that requires a swift resolution.
The public will demand it and this
department will provide it.  Six
victims.  One of them, one of our
own -- Dick Stensland."
336,DUDLEY,336,"As it happens, he was a Nite Owl
regular.  In the wrong place at
the wrong time."
337,DUDLEY,337,"Robbery looks like the motive.  We
have rubber glove prints on the
register and preliminary forensics
strongly lean toward a trio of
gunmen.  We do have one hot lead,
so listen well.  Three Negro
youths were seen last night
discharging shotguns in the air at
Griffith Park.
A park ranger I.D.ed them as
driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury
Coupe, purple in color.  An hour
ago, a canvassing crew found a
news vendor who saw a purple Merc
Coupe parked across from the Nite
Owl around 3:00 A.M."
338,DUDLEY,338,"The D.M.V. worked all night to get
us a registration list on '48 to
'50 purple Mercs.  There are 142
registered to Negroes in L.A.
County.  Fifty two-man teams will
shake three names apiece.  Hot
suspects you'll bring here.
Interrogation rooms have been set
up.  They'll be run by Lieutenant
Edmund Exley.  Hollywood Squad."
339,CHIEF,339,"Enough on that.  Gentlemen, just
go out and get them.  Use all
necessary force.  The people of
Los Angeles demand it."
340,EXLEY,340,"He might as well have put a bounty
on them."
341,BUD,341,"Can you take them?  I got
I got something I gotta do."
342,PARTNER,342,"Christ, I don't know.  What if one
of these names..."
343,BUD,343,"What I gotta do is for Stensland.
My partner."
344,REDNECK,344,"Where to, Trash?"
345,JACK,345,"If we go by the list, we have
about zero chance of making the
collar.  But I know a guy who
knows what's going on south of
Jefferson.  I'm betting he could
put us at 50/50."
346,REDNECK,346,I don't know...
347,EXLEY,347,I'll take those odds.
348,EXLEY,348,Take off.  We got it from here.
349,REDNECK,349,"Between the two of you guys, you
should bring along a photographer."
350,BUD,350,"I need an address on a customer of
yours.  Her name was Lynn."
351,OWNER,351,That's all I have to go on?
352,BUD,352,"Yeah.  And I think you already
know who I mean, so cough it up."
353,OWNER,353,"Lynn Bracken.  There's a billing
address and a delivery address."
354,BUD,354,Give me both.  Billing first.
355,BUD (O.S.),355,"You must slay 'em at the country
club."
356,BUD,356,Are you Pierce Patchett?
357,PATCHETT,357,"I am.  Are you soliciting for
police charities?  The last time,
you people called at my office."
358,BUD,358,"I'm a homicide detective.  Where
were you last night?"
359,PATCHETT,359,"I was here, hosting a party.  Who
was killed and why do you think I
can help?"
360,BUD,360,Richard Stensland.
361,PATCHETT,361,I don't know him.  Mr...
362,BUD,362,"Officer White.  How about Susan
Lefferts?  You know her?"
363,PATCHETT,363,"You know I do or you wouldn't be
here.  How did you find me?"
364,BUD,364,"We met outside Hollywood Liquors
on Christmas Eve.  This is where
Lynn Bracken's booze bills go."
365,PATCHETT,365,Of course...
366,BUD,366,"Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.
I'm investigating."
367,BODYGUARD,367,"Everything alright, Mr. Patchett?"
368,PATCHETT,368,"Fine, Philip.  Thank you."
369,BUD,369,Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
370,PATCHETT,370,He no longer works for me.
371,PATCHETT,371,"Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.
I'll give you a handsome reward."
372,BUD,372,"Thanks, but no thanks."
373,PATCHETT,373,Against your code?
374,BUD,374,"I don't have one.  Lefferts looked
beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't
act it.  How come?"
375,PATCHETT,375,"Do you care about criminal matters
peripheral to Susan's murder?"
376,BUD,376,No.
377,PATCHETT,377,"Then you wouldn't feel obligated
to report them?"
378,BUD,378,That's right.
379,PATCHETT,379,"Then listen closely, because I'll
only say this once and if it gets
repeated, I'll deny it.  I run
call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one
of them and so was Susan Lefferts.
I treat my girls very well.  I
have grown daughters, myself, and
I don't like the thought of women
being hurt.  I sense you share
this feeling."
380,BUD,380,Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
381,PATCHETT,381,"I think she'd been hit in the face
with a tennis racket.  She is --
was -- a big doubles fan."
382,BUD,382,"You wanna go downtown and discuss
this officially?"
383,PATCHETT,383,Wait.  Our deal still holds?
384,PATCHETT,384,"I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill
out my little studio."
385,BUD,385,What little studio?
386,PATCHETT,386,"There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable,
Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my
Veronica Lake.  I use girls who
look like movie stars.  Sometimes
I employ a plastic surgeon."
387,BUD,387,"That's why her mother couldn't
I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ."
388,PATCHETT,388,"No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse
Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on
your best behavior, but that's all
I'll give you.  If you persist,
I'll meet you with my attorney.
Now, would you like Miss Bracken's
address?  I doubt she knows
anything, but --"
389,BUD,389,I got her address.
390,PATCHETT,390,"Of course... this is personal with
you, isn't it, Mr. White?"
391,LYNN,391,Hello?
392,OLDER GENTLEMAN,392,Is it the cops?
393,JACK,393,Leonard Bidwell?
394,JACK,394,How's the left these days?
395,BOXER,395,What's it to you?
396,JACK,396,"I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I
like your style."
397,BOXER,397,"What do you want, Mr. Policeman?"
398,JACK,398,"You got a brother up in Folsom.  I
know because I put him there."
399,BOXER,399,Till 19-fucking-70.
400,JACK,400,"How'd you like to make it 1960?  I
know the judge and Sergeant Exley
here is friends with hte D.A."
401,JACK,401,"We're looking for three colored
guys who like to pop off shotguns.
One of 'em owns a purple Merc
coupe."
402,BOXER,402,"You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch
jacket?"
403,JACK,403,"You wanna buy your brother ten
years...?  You don't have to say
anything.  Just look at this list
and point.  Here."
404,BOXER,404,"He's bad, so I'll just tell you.
Sugar Ray Coates.  Drives a '49
coupe, a beautiful ride.  Don't
know about shotguns, but he gets
his thrills killing dogs.  He is
righteous trash."
405,JACK,405,That's five minutes from here.
406,OLDER GENTLEMAN,406,"I don't understand, doll, we just
got started."
407,LYNN,407,"I'm sorry, but I'll make it up
to you.  I promise."
408,OLDER GENTLEMAN,408,"Gosh, kitten, I don't know..."
409,BUD (O.S.),409,"Hit the road, gramps."
410,OLDER GENTLEMAN,410,"Alright.  This time I'll go, but
next time --"
411,BUD,411,"L.A.P.D., shitbird.  Get the fuck
out of here or I'll call your wife
to come get you."
412,LYNN,412,"I've been expecting you.  Pierce
called.  Told me what happened
to Sue."
413,LYNN,413,"It's Officer White, isn't it?"
414,LYNN,414,Can I get you a drink?
415,BUD,415,"Yeah, plain scotch."
416,LYNN,416,"I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren't really friends.
You know what I mean?"
417,BUD,417,Are you sorry she's dead?
418,LYNN,418,"Of course I am.  What kind of
question is that?"
419,BUD,419,"Have you ever heard of Dick
Stensland?"
420,LYNN,420,"No I haven't.  Do you know why
Pierce is humoring you?"
421,BUD,421,"You use words like that, you
might make me mad."
422,LYNN,422,Yes.  But do you know?
423,BUD,423,"Yeah I know.  Patchett's running
whores and judging by his address,
probably something bigger on the
side.  He doesn't want any
attention."
424,LYNN,424,"That's right.  Our motives are
selfish, so we're cooperating."
425,BUD,425,"Why was Susan Lefferts at the
Nite Owl?"
426,LYNN,426,"I don't know.  I never heard of
the Nite Owl till today."
427,BUD,427,Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
428,LYNN,428,"Like I said we were friendly,
not friends."
429,BUD,429,How'd she meet Patchett?
430,LYNN,430,"Pierce meets people.  Sue came
on the bus with dreams of
Hollywood.  This is how they
turned out.  Thanks to Pierce,
we still get to act a little."
431,BUD,431,Tell me about Patchett.
432,LYNN,432,"He's waiting for you to mention
mention."
433,BUD,433,"You want some advice, Miss
Bracken?"
434,LYNN,434,It's Lynn.
435,BUD,435,"Miss Bracken, don't ever try to
fucking bribe me or threaten me
or I'll have you and Patchett
in shit up to your ears."
436,LYNN,436,"I remember you from Christmas
Eve.  You have a thing for
helping women, don't you,
Officer White?"
437,BUD,437,Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
438,LYNN,438,You say 'fuck' a lot.
439,BUD,439,You fuck for money.
440,LYNN,440,"There's blood on your shirt.  Is
that an integral part of your job?"
441,BUD,441,Yeah.
442,LYNN,442,Do you enjoy it?
443,BUD,443,When they deserve it.
444,LYNN,444,Did they deserve it today?
445,BUD,445,I'm not sure.
446,LYNN,446,But you did it anyway.
447,BUD,447,"Yeah, just like the half dozen
guys you screwed today."
448,LYNN,448,"Actually, it was two.  You're
different, Officer White.  You're
the first man in five years who
didn't tell me I look like
Veronica Lake inside of a minute."
449,BUD,449,"You look better than Veronica
Lake.  Now,"
450,LYNN,450,"He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.  He makes
us quit the life at thirty.  He
doesn't let us use narcotics and
he doesn't abuse us.  Can your
policeman's mentality grasp
those contradictions?"
451,BUD,451,"He had you cut to look like
Veronica Lake?"
452,LYNN,452,"No.  I'm really a brunette, but
the rest is me.  And that's all
the news that's fit to print."
453,LYNN,453,"It was nice meeting you, Officer."
454,BUD,454,Look.  I want to see you again.
455,LYNN,455,"Are you asking me for a date or
an appointment?"
456,BUD,456,I don't know.
457,LYNN,457,"If it's a date I think you'd
better tell me your first name
because I --"
458,BUD,458,"Forget I asked.  It was a
mistake."
459,EXLEY,459,L.A.P.D.
460,JACK,460,Hey.
461,CARLISLE,461,"What the fuck are you guys doing
here?"
462,EXLEY,462,Think of us as back-up.
463,JACK,463,What do you got?
464,BREUNING,464,"Three Ithaca pumps, an empty box
of double-ought buck and cash."
465,JACK,465,"So long, Vice.  Badge of Honor,
here I come."
466,CARLISLE,466,"Fuck you, Vincennes.  It's our
collar."
467,EXLEY,467,"Quiet.  I'm ranking officer here.
We go as a team.  End of story."
468,EXLEY,468,Damnit...
469,JACK,469,What?
470,EXLEY,470,Glasses.
471,JACK,471,Just don't shoot me.
472,JACK,472,Freeze!
473,CARLISLE,473,"Ace him, Jack."
474,EXLEY,474,"Shut up, Carlisle!"
475,EXLEY,475,"Casitas Youth Camp... Coates
twenty-two, a boxer... Manager
saw them burning clothes."
476,DUDLEY,476,"Ed, I want confessions."
477,EXLEY,477,"I'll break them, sir."
478,JACK,478,"You think golden boy can handle
it, Cap?"
479,DUDLEY,479,"I think you'll be surprised what
Edmund's capable of."
480,EXLEY,480,"They call you Sugar Ray because
of Ray Robinson?"
481,EXLEY,481,"They say Robinson can throw a
four punch combination in one
second.  Do you believe that?"
482,EXLEY,482,"You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?"
483,COATES,483,Say what and so what.
484,EXLEY,484,"Did one of the officers work you
over a little?"
485,EXLEY,485,"You look like Robinson after
that last LaMotta fight.  'Course
LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So
you're twenty-two, right?"
486,COATES,486,"Man, why do you keep asking me
that?"
487,EXLEY,487,"Just getting my facts straight.
Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber
bounce.
You should have pulled this caper
a couple of years ago.  Get life,
do a little Youth Authority jolt,
transfer to Folsom a big man.
Orbit on some of that good prison
brew, get yourself a sissy --"
488,COATES,488,I never truck with no sissies!
489,EXLEY,489,"That fucking Larry.  I almost
believed him."
490,COATES,490,Believed what?
491,EXLEY,491,"Nothing, Ray."
492,EXLEY,492,"That Larry, he's a pisser.  You
did the Casitas Youth Camp with
him, didn't you?"
493,COATES,493,"Man, why're you talkin' about
Larry?  His business is his
business."
494,EXLEY,494,"Sugar, Larry told me you went
sissy up at Casitas.  You
couldn't do the time so you
found yourself a big white boy
to look after you.  He said
they call you 'Sugar' because
you gave it out so sweet."
495,COATES (V.O.),495,"Larry gave it at Casitas!  Man,
I was the fuckin' boss jocker on
my dorm!  Larry's the sissy!
Larry gave it for candy bars!"
496,EXLEY,496,"Ray, you protected Ty and Larry
up in Casitas, didn't you?"
497,COATES,497,"You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid
down home niggers got no more
sense than a fuckin' dog."
498,EXLEY,498,I heard you like to shoot dogs.
499,COATES,499,Dogs got no reason to live.
500,EXLEY,500,"Oh?  you feel that way about
people, too?"
501,COATES,501,"Man, what're you saying?"
502,EXLEY,502,"Ray, we got the shotguns."
503,COATES,503,I don't own no shotguns.
504,EXLEY,504,"Why were you throwing clothes
in the building incinerator?"
505,COATES,505,Say what?
506,EXLEY,506,"You guys were arrested this
morning, but none of you have
last night's clothes."
507,EXLEY,507,"seen burning them.  Add to that
the fact that you hid the car
you were cruising around in
last night and it doesn't look
good."
508,COATES,508,"I got nothin' more to say till
I see a judge."
509,EXLEY,509,"Were you on hop?  You were passed
out when you got arrested.  Were
you hopped up, Ray?"
510,COATES,510,"Ty and Larry fuck with that
shit, not me."
511,EXLEY,511,"Where do they get their stuff?
Come on.  Give me one to feed
the D.A.  Just a little one."
512,COATES,512,"Roland Navarette.  Lives on
Bunker Hill.  He runs a hole-up
for parole absconders and sells
red devils."
513,EXLEY,513,I'm going to take a break.
514,EXLEY,514,"You know, Ray, I'm talking about
the gas chamber and you haven't
even asked me what this is all
about.  You got a big guilty
sign around your neck."
515,DUDLEY,515,"Masterful, Edmund.  Your father
would've been proud."
516,DUDLEY,516,This one's on the verge.
517,EXLEY,517,"Fontaine next, but give Jones
the newspaper.  I want him
primed."
518,EXLEY,518,"Larry, Ray Coates ratted you
off.  He said the Nite Owl was
your idea.  You want to tell me
about it?"
519,EXLEY,519,"I think it was Ray's idea.  Talk
and I think I can save your life."
520,EXLEY,520,"Larry, this is a gas chamber job.
If you don't talk, you'll be dead
in six months."
521,EXLEY,521,"Son, six people are dead and
somebody has to pay.  It can be
you or it can be Ray."
522,EXLEY,522,"Larry, he called you queer.  He
said at Casitas you took it up
the ass.  He said --"
523,FONTAINE,523,I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY!
524,EXLEY,524,Why'd you burn the clothes?
525,FONTAINE,525,"I just wanted to lose my cherry.
I didn't mean to hurt her."
526,EXLEY,526,"Hurt who?  Was she a hooker?
Hurt who?"
527,DUDLEY,527,"Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with
the Nite Owl."
528,EXLEY,528,"She may still be alive, whoever
she is."
529,JONES,529,This newspaper shit ain't shit.
530,EXLEY,530,Where's the girl?  Did you kill her?
531,EXLEY,531,"You wanted Larry to lose his
cherry, but things got out of
hand.  Is that right?"
532,EXLEY,532,"Kick loose, Jones.  I know you
made her bleed, but that doesn't
mean you killed her."
533,EXLEY,533,"If that girl's alive, you've
still got a chance on this one."
534,JONES,534,I think she's alive.
535,EXLEY,535,You
536,JACK,536,He's good.  I'll give him that.
537,EXLEY,537,Where is she now?
538,EXLEY,538,Did you leave her someplace?
539,EXLEY,539,"Did you sell her out?  Give her
to some of your buddies?  Tell
me where the girl is!"
540,BUD,540,One in six.  Where's the girl?
541,EXLEY,541,"Officer White, put down that
weapon and --"
542,JONES,542,"S-sylvester F-fitch one-o-nine
and Avalon gray corner house..."
543,BUD,543,Give me one minute.
544,DUDLEY,544,"You've got it, Wendell."
545,DUDLEY,545,We're going through the front.
546,BUD,546,Get her to the fucking hospital.
547,EXLEY,547,"A naked guy with a gun?  You
expect anyone to believe that?"
548,BUD,548,Get the fuck away from me.
549,EXLEY,549,"How's it going to look on your
report?"
550,BUD,550,"It'll look like justice.  That's
what that fat fuck got."
551,EXLEY,551,"You don't know what the word means,
you dumb bastard."
552,DISPATCHER (V.O.),552,"Repeat, three suspects escaped
from the Hall of Justice jail.
The Nite Owl killers:  Raymond
Coates, Tyrone Jones and Larry
Fontaine.  They are considered
armed and extremely dangerous.
Descriptions are as follows..."
553,EXLEY,553,"'Give me one to feed the D.A....
Roland Navarette.  Lives on
Bunker Hill.  Runs a hole-up for
parole absconders.'"
554,EXLEY,554,Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?
555,CARLISLE,555,"Is something up, Lieutenant?"
556,EXLEY,556,Nobody move!
557,CHIEF,557,"We mourn the passing of a good
man.  The loss of Sgt. William
Carlisle is the loss of his
wife, his family and the entire
Los Angeles Police Department..."
558,EXLEY,558,"I need the girl to give me a
chronology of events.  No details.
Just times."
559,NURSE,559,"Absolutely not.  She barely
remembers her own name."
560,EXLEY,560,But --
561,NURSE,561,"I was told the case was closed.
Should I call your superior to
double-check?"
562,EXLEY,562,No.  that won't be necessary.
563,OLDER GENTLEMAN,563,"You tell Mr. Patchett I have no
intention of changing my vote."
564,OLDER GENTLEMAN,564,"It may surprise some, but a mature
man, enlightened by the facts, can
change him mind..."
565,CHIEF,565,"Edmund J. Exley has amassed a
brilliant record in his seven
years with the L.A.P.D.  Recently
he evinced spectacular bravery in
the line of duty.  It is my honor
to present him with our highest
honor, the Medal of Valor."
566,DUDLEY,566,Your father would've been proud.
567,EXLEY,567,"There are loose ends out there,
Dudley.  I --"
568,DUDLEY,568,"There always are.  But there are
also three men and three guns.
Matched forensically.  A few loose
ends don't matter."
569,EXLEY,569,"Something's wrong.  I feel it
inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?"
570,DUDLEY,570,"Breaking a big case sticks you in
a whirlwind.  A little self-doubt?
It's natural.  Just keep it
inside.  Between you and you."
571,CHASE,571,"This election is about the future
of law enforcement in Los Angeles.
Ellis Loew represents that future.
So dig deep and let's get a moral
man re-elected."
572,HUDGEON (O.S.),572,Big V Jack Vincennes!
573,HUDGEONS,573,"You're back, boychick."
574,JACK,574,"Sid, how are they hanging?"
575,HUDGEONS,575,Down around my ankles.
576,HUDGEONS,576,You remember Matt Reynolds?
577,HUDGEONS,577,"The Grauman's Chinese pot bust.
He just got off the honor farm."
578,JACK,578,"What's he doing here, Sid?"
579,HUDGEONS,579,"You tight with the D.A., trash?"
580,JACK,580,"Sure, he just tried to throw me
off the force last Christmas as a
little joke."
581,HUDGEONS,581,"How'd you like a little payback?
Not to mention a donation to the
widows and orphans fund.  Did you
know Loew was a swish?"
582,JACK,582,And Reynolds?
583,HUDGEONS,583,"He's queer too.  Metro paid him
two grand a week to fake it with
ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm
getting him to fuck the D.A. for a
hundred bucks."
584,HUDGEONS,584,"That's twice the fifty you got for
wrecking his career."
585,HUDGEONS,585,Matt!  Over here!
586,HUDGEONS,586,That's D.A. Loew right there.
587,HUDGEONS,587,"You need a drink, kid... Jack,
look after him a minute.  Kid,
this is Jack.  No secrets between
me and him."
588,REYNOLDS,588,Have we met before?
589,JACK,589,Yeah.
590,REYNOLDS,590,Was it a party?
591,JACK,591,Something like that.
592,REYNOLDS,592,"Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party,
right?"
593,JACK,593,"Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you
desire.'"
594,REYNOLDS,594,"Dope, liquor, hookers that look
like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett
has it all."
595,JACK,595,"Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way
back."
596,REYNOLDS,596,"Pierce isn't like regular people.
I dig him, but he scares me too."
597,JACK,597,Really?  How?
598,REYNOLDS,598,"You know, when I came out to L.A.,
this isn't exactly where I saw
myself ending up."
599,JACK,599,Yeah.  Me neither.
600,HUDGEONS,600,"Dutch courage, kid.  Drink up."
601,REYNOLDS,601,I don't know if I should do this.
602,HUDGEONS,602,"Hey, it's not like you don't know
how.  And Jack here has
connections on 'Badge of Honor.'
Pull this off and there'll be a
part for you.  I smell a comeback.
Don't you, Jack?"
603,JACK,603,Loew's free.  Congratulate him.
604,HUDGEONS,604,"If Reynolds works his charms,
which he will, this is the address
where they'll be.  Meet me at
midnight.  I guarantee all sorts
of illegal activity."
605,JACK,605,"Sid, why would a guy like Pierce
Patchett get involved with running
dope and hookers?"
606,HUDGEONS,606,Where'd you hear that?
607,JACK,607,Around.
608,HUDGEONS,608,"Jackie, all I know is what you
know.  The man is very rich.  And
he's invested in freeway
construction so he's gonna get a
lot richer.  But that's it.
Patchett's what I like to call
'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he
ain't Red, he can't help me in my
quest for prime sinuendo."
609,REYNOLDS,609,I can't do it.
610,HUDGEONS,610,"Talk to him, Jack.  Tell him about
the opening on the show."
611,JACK,611,"I'm pretty sure I can get you a
part on the show... But tonight?
Pretend it's an acting job, kid.
Showbiz."
612,REYNOLDS,612,And no one'll know about this?
613,JACK,613,It'll be our secret.
614,REYNOLDS,614,Showbiz.
615,DUDLEY,615,"Where did you intend to start.
Prostitution?  Gambling?"
616,DUDLEY,616,"Go back to Cleveland, lad.  This
is the City of Angels and you
haven't got any wings."
617,LYNN,617,Did you forget some --
618,LYNN,618,"I wondered when you might ring the
bell again, Officer White."
619,BUD,619,It's Bud.
620,LYNN,620,"You should see yourself.  You look
like you're ten years old."
621,LYNN,621,"If you'd called first, I wouldn't
look this ridiculous."
622,LYNN,622,"You're wondering if Patchett told
me to be receptive."
623,LYNN,623,"It doesn't matter.  I like you,
Bud.  I really do."
624,JACK,624,"Come on, Sid.  Where are you?"
625,JACK,625,It's Vincennes!  Open up!
626,HUDGEONS,626,"Jackie!  You got some good scoop
for the Sidster?"
627,JACK,627,"Sid, cut the crap.  I --"
628,HUDGEONS,628,"Give me some Narco skinny.  I want
to put out an all hop-head issue.
Shvartze jazz musicians and movie
stars.  Maybe tie it into the
Rosenbergs.  You like?"
629,JACK,629,Shut up!
630,HUDGEONS,630,"What's wrong, Trash?"
631,HUDGEONS,631,"What happened with the kid and
Loew?"
632,HUDGEONS,632,"You didn't get my message?  It got
called off.  The kid chickened out
at the last minute."
633,JACK,633,"He's dead.  I was just there.
Somebody slit his throat."
634,HUDGEONS,634,"Jesus.  Jack, that's a story.
'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.'
Let me get my camera."
635,JACK,635,"Loew didn't go with him.  You're
sure?"
636,HUDGEONS,636,"I put Reynolds in the cab myself.
The night cost me a hundred scoots
and I got bupkis."
637,HUDGEONS,637,"Jackie!  Big V!  Let me get my
camera!  Where are you going?!"
638,BARTENDER,638,"What'll it be, Jack?"
639,JACK,639,A bottle of Scotch.
640,BARTENDER,640,Hey!  Your change!
641,BUD,641,"Who was that guy who was here
earlier?"
642,LYNN,642,"It doesn't matter.  All they get
is Veronica Lake.  You got the
real Lynn Margaret Bracken..."
643,LYNN,643,Where'd this come from?
644,BUD,644,"When I was ten, my old man threw a
bottle at my mother.  I guess I
got in the way."
645,LYNN,645,So you saved her.
646,BUD,646,Yeah.  But not for long.
647,LYNN,647,"Do you like being a cop, Bud?"
648,BUD,648,"I used to.  What I do now is
strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff...
No, I don't like it.  If I could
work Homicide like a real
detective..."
649,BUD,649,"There's something wrong with the
Nite Owl.  That prick Exley shot
the wrong guys.  But they made him
a hero and whoever killed my
partner is still out there."
650,BUD,650,"In here I know it.  But I can't
prove it.  I'm not a detective.
I'm not smart enough.  I'm just
the guy they bring in to scare the
other guy shitless."
651,LYNN,651,"You found Patchett.  You found me.
You're smart enough.  Be a
detective if that's what you want."
652,BUD,652,"That simple, huh?"
653,CLERK,653,"I got the rap sheets on the black
guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got
charges a mile long.  But except
for some kid stuff, Fontaine's
clean."
654,EXLEY,654,Clean?
655,CLERK,655,More or less.
656,EXLEY,656,Until he gunned down six people.
657,PARK RANGER,657,"I asked my men, Lieutenant.  No
one remembers any colored guys
firing shotguns."
658,EXLEY,658,Then who phoned in the report?
659,PARK RANGER,659,Not us.
660,PINKER,660,"Bud White, what brings you down to
the basement?"
661,BUD,661,I got a few Nite Owl questions.
662,PINKER,662,"I don't know if you read the
papers, but that case is closed."
663,BUD,663,"I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding
my report.  You know how it goes."
664,PINKER,664,What do you want to know?
665,BUD,665,"Anything off.  Anything that
didn't make sense."
666,PINKER,666,"You mean beside the fact that
thirty-five out of forty-five
rounds were gratuitous?  I can't
think of anything."
667,BUD,667,Whose shoe?
668,PINKER,668,Susan Lefferts.
669,BUD,669,"If she was sitting here, then it's
facing the wrong way.  What are
these smears in the blood?"
670,PINKER,670,"It looks like she was flailing,
trying to get away."
671,BUD,671,"But she's moving away from the
door."
672,BUD,672,Who was sitting at this table?
673,PINKER,673,Dick Stensland.
674,PINKER,674,"Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew
him she would've been sitting with
him... Right?"
675,PINKER,675,"You know, there is one thing."
676,PINKER,676,"Cotton balls.  I found them just
inside the meat locker door."
677,PINKER,677,"Exactly.  At least one of those
animals had the brains to protect
his ears."
678,BUD,678,"It doesn't exactly play like dumb
panic."
679,PINKER,679,What do you mean?
680,BUD,680,"It's like they knew they were
going to kill everyone before they
went in..."
681,PINKER,681,"Yeah, so..."
682,BUD,682,"Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White
with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask
a couple of questions."
683,MRS. LEFFERTS,683,Let my daughter rest in peace.
684,BUD,684,Five minutes.  That's all.
685,BUD,685,"Tell me about the boyfriend she
had.  The one you mentioned at the
morgue."
686,MRS. LEFFERTS,686,"First I want to go on record as
saying that my Susie was a virgin
when she died."
687,BUD,687,"Ma'am, I'm sure she was."
688,MRS. LEFFERTS,688,"Susie, I told you I didn't approve
of that boyfriend.  He was too old
for you.  You let him come into
this house and be fresh to me.  I
went out one day and old Mrs.
Jensen next door saw Susan's
boyfriend and another man and
thought she heard a ruckus."
689,BUD,689,What was that boyfriend's name?
690,MRS. LEFFERTS,690,"We were never properly introduced.
Susan and I were fighting that
day.  She called him by a
nickname.  Muns or Lunts or
something."
691,BUD,691,Stens?  Was it Stens?
692,MRS. LEFFERTS,692,Maybe.  I don't know.
693,BUD,693,Look at a picture for me.
694,MRS. LEFFERTS,694,That's him.  That's him.
695,BUD,695,"You said a neighbor heard a
ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?"
696,MRS. LEFFERTS,696,"I don't know.  You'll have to
leave now, Officer."
697,BUD,697,What's through here?
698,MRS. LEFFERTS,698,No!  Please leave!
699,MRS. LEFFERTS,699,"Don't mind the smell.  I think a
rat died behind the wall... My
Susie was a good girl!"
700,BUD,700,Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
701,MRS. LEFFERTS,701,"I came home that night and there
was blood on the floor.  Susan
said Stams -- Stens had cut
himself.  They were acting
nervous.  And that Stens kept
going under the house."
702,BUD,702,Buzz Meeks... Holy shit.
703,MRS. LEFFERTS,703,Was it... a rat?
704,BUD,704,Yeah.  A great big one.
705,BUD,705,"Here.  Compliments of the Los
Angeles Police Department."
706,PINKER,706,"Hey, just in time for our stomach
of the week.  Frankfurters with
sauerkraut, French fries,
Coca-Cola, alcohol and sperm.
Jesus, what a last supper."
707,EXLEY,707,"The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering
you about the case?"
708,PINKER,708,"Yeah.  The fact that you guys
won't let it get filed away."
709,EXLEY,709,What are you talking about?
710,PINKER,710,"Bud White grilled me on it this
morning.  You know, he's not as
dumb as I thought."
711,MRS. LEFFERTS,711,Let my Susie rest in peace!
712,EXLEY,712,"Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask
a few questions."
713,MRS. LEFFERTS,713,"That other policeman already
checked under the house and found
not a thing amiss."
714,EXLEY,714,Officer White?
715,MRS. LEFFERTS,715,A sweet man.
716,EXLEY,716,Under the house.
717,MRS. LEFFERTS,717,"All he found were rodents.  No
signs of foul play.  So there."
718,MRS. LEFFERTS,718,My daughter was a virgin!
719,EXLEY (O.S.),719,"I don't doubt it -- Oh, God."
720,EXLEY,720,"I need an I.D. ASAP.  You talk
only to me on this one."
721,JACK,721,"Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes
requesting.  I need the home
address on a Pierce Patchett."
722,OPERATOR (V.O.),722,"Please hold, Sergeant..."
723,EXLEY,723,I need to speak to you.
724,JACK,724,"Give me a minute, will ya?"
725,JACK,725,Damnit...
726,EXLEY,726,I want you to follow Bud White.
727,JACK,727,Even I'm not that crazy.
728,EXLEY,728,"It's not a request.  I need to
know what White knows.  Follow him
or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge
of Honor.'  Permanently."
729,JACK,729,"Yesterday that might've meant
something.  Pull me off.  You'd be
doing me a big favor."
730,EXLEY,730,"Yesterday yes, today no.  What
happened last night?"
731,JACK,731,"Transfer me, suspend me.  Just
leave me alone."
732,EXLEY,732,You make a mistake?
733,JACK,733,Yeah.  My whole life.
734,EXLEY,734,"Listen, I think I made a mistake,
too."
735,JACK,735,"I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I
can't hear your confession."
736,EXLEY,736,"Do you make the three Negroes for
the Nite Owl killings?"
737,JACK,737,What?
738,EXLEY,738,It's a simple question.
739,JACK,739,"You should be the last person who
wants to dig any deeper into the
Nite Owl,"
740,EXLEY,740,Rollo Tomasi.
741,JACK,741,"Is there more to that, or do I
have to guess?"
742,EXLEY,742,"Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My
father ran into him off duty.  He
shot my father six times and got
away clean.  No one even knew who
he was.  I made the name up to
give him some personality."
743,JACK,743,So what's the point?
744,EXLEY,744,"Rollo's the reason I became a cop.
I wanted to catch the guys who
thought they could get away with
it.  It was supposed to be about
truth and justice and Rollo.  But
somewhere along the way I forgot
all that... How about you, Jack?
Why'd you become a cop?"
745,JACK,745,I don't remember...
746,JACK,746,"I'm trying to figure what angle
you're playing"
747,JACK,747,sure as hell can't see one.
748,EXLEY,748,"I've given up angles for awhile.
I just want to solve this thing."
749,JACK,749,"The Nite Owl was solved,
Lieutenant."
750,EXLEY,750,I want to do it right.
751,JACK,751,"Okay, college boy, I'll help you.
But I want half the collar."
752,EXLEY,752,"A third.  I don't think we can
make a case without Bud White."
753,STOMPANATO,753,"Wendell White, how's tricks,"
754,BUD,754,I ain't your
755,BUD,755,cocksucker.
756,STOMPANATO,756,"What do you want,"
757,BUD,757,"You remember an ex-cop named Buzz
Meeks?  He works for a guy named
Patchett."
758,STOMPANATO,758,Should I?
759,BUD,759,"His file listed you as a known
associate.  Now spill."
760,STOMPANATO,760,"Oh, yeah.  That was a long time
ago.  Before your day.  The last
few years he's been muscle for
hire.  But I heard he's
disappeared."
761,BUD,761,More.
762,STOMPANATO,762,More's gonna cost you.
763,BUD,763,"How 'bout I give you your balls
back?"
764,STOMPANATO,764,"Before Meeks disappeared he was
popping off about trying to move
eighteen pounds of heroin."
765,BUD,765,"Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit
ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?"
766,STOMPANATO,766,"Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's
narcotics lieutenant.  The night
he got clipped, eighteen pounds of
Mickey's heroin went missing."
767,STOMPANATO,767,"Meeks is probably in Rio or
someplace like that by now."
768,BUD,768,"He's under a tract house in San
Berdoo.  And he don't smell too
good.  What happened to the
heroin, Johnny?"
769,STOMPANATO,769,I don't know.  I swear it!
770,JACK,770,"He's in the Brown Derby with
Johnny Stompanato."
771,JACK,771,Check that.  I gotta go.
772,EXLEY,772,What's that for?
773,JACK,773,"Bud White.  He sees us and we're
dead."
774,JACK,774,"Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb
after all."
775,EXLEY,775,"Rita Hayworth at the morgue and
now Veronica Lake with White.
What the hell's going on?"
776,JACK,776,"Movie star hookers.  Whatever you
desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again."
777,EXLEY,777,What's Fleur-de-Lis?
778,JACK,778,"High line whores.  With plastic
surgery to look like movie stars.
And who knows what else?  It's run
by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You
want to talk to him?"
779,EXLEY,779,"Yeah.  But first I want to brace
Stompanato."
780,EXLEY,780,Check the bar.  I got the restaurant.
781,STOMPANATO,781,"Hey, you want an autograph, write
to M-G-M."
782,EXLEY,782,"Since when do two-bit hoods and
hookers give out autographs?"
783,EXLEY,783,L.A.P.D.  Sit down.
784,"""LANA""",784,"Who in the hell do you think you
are?"
785,EXLEY,785,"Take a walk, honey, before I haul
your ass downtown."
786,STOMPANATO,786,You are making a large mistake.
787,"""LANA""",787,Get away from our table!
788,EXLEY,788,"Shut up.  Being cut to look like
Lana Turner doesn't mean you are
Lana Turner."
789,JACK,789,She is Lana Turner.
790,EXLEY,790,What?
791,JACK,791,She
792,EXLEY,792,How was I supposed to know?
793,PATCHETT,793,"I believe the Nite Owl's your area
of expertise, Mr. Exley.  I saw
you on television getting your
medal."
794,PATCHETT,794,"And you're that other celebrity
Hollywood policeman, aren't you?"
795,PATCHETT,795,"I'll tell you what I told Officer
White when he asked me about
Susan's death."
796,EXLEY,796,Bud White's been here?
797,PATCHETT,797,"For the last time.  I may suborn
women into illicit activities, but
they're handsomely compensated, I
treat them well and make sure the
men they deal with show them every
due respect."
798,EXLEY,798,"Is the Veronica Lake look-alike
one of your whores?"
799,PATCHETT,799,"A vulgar term, but yes."
800,EXLEY,800,What's her name?
801,PATCHETT,801,Lynn Bracken.
802,EXLEY,802,Why's she seeing Bud White?
803,PATCHETT,803,"Why do men and women usually see
each other?"
804,EXLEY,804,"Anything else you want to add
before I talk to her?"
805,PATCHETT,805,No.
806,EXLEY,806,Not good enough.
807,PATCHETT,807,"Then try talking to my lawyer.
Good evening, gentlemen."
808,JACK,808,Guy's as cool as they come.
809,EXLEY,809,This is Exley.
810,DISPATCHER (V.O.),810,"Ray Pinker wants to talk to you,
Lieutenant.  Says he has your I.D."
811,EXLEY,811,"Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is
coming in to talk to him."
812,JACK,812,What are you going to do?
813,EXLEY,813,"I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll
meet you at the Dining Car."
814,JACK,814,"Great.  You get the girl, I get
the coroner."
815,HUDGEONS (V.O.),815,the Q.T.
816,EXLEY,816,"Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant
Exley."
817,LYNN,817,"I know who you are.  You're the
policeman Bud told me about."
818,EXLEY,818,Really?  What did White say?
819,LYNN,819,"He said you were smart.  He also
said you were competing with your
dead father.  How did he put it?
Trying to measure up to a ghost."
820,EXLEY,820,"Let's concentrate on my smarts.
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't
he?  He taught you how to dress
and talk and think and I am very
impressed with the results.  But I
need some answers and if I don't
get them, I'm going to take you
and Patchett down."
821,LYNN,821,"He can take care of himself and
I'm not afraid of you.  And you
forgot one thing, Lieutenant.
Pierce also taught me how to
fuck... Can I get you a drink?"
822,EXLEY,822,Scotch.
823,LYNN,823,I'm curious about you.
824,EXLEY,824,Why?
825,LYNN,825,"Because Bud hates you more than he
loves me."
826,LYNN,826,"It galls you that I know so much
about you.  You don't have
information to compete."
827,EXLEY,827,"Don't underestimate me, Miss
Bracken."
828,LYNN,828,"The way you've underestimated Bud
White?"
829,PINKER,829,"God bless dental records.  Stiff
used to be a cop.  Turner Meeks."
830,PINKER,830,You knew him?
831,JACK,831,"Of him.  He was around when I
first joined the force.  A bad
egg."
832,JACK,832,"Come on, Exley.  Where are you?"
833,EXLEY,833,How was I?
834,LYNN,834,"Oh, the best I ever had.
Absolutely the best."
835,EXLEY,835,You sound like you mean it.
836,LYNN,836,"The silver screen's loss is your
gain."
837,EXLEY,837,How about White?
838,LYNN,838,"You want to know what Bud's like
in bed?"
839,EXLEY,839,"I want to know why you see him.
Is it a Patchett payoff?"
840,LYNN,840,"I see Bud because I want to.  I
see Bud because he can't hide the
warmth he has inside him."
841,EXLEY,841,I'll take your word for it.
842,LYNN,842,"I see Bud because he makes me feel
like Lynn Bracken and not some
Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks
for money.  I see him because he
doesn't know how to disguise who
he is.  There's more if you want
to hear it."
843,LYNN,843,"Does all that make it harder for
you to hate him or easier?"
844,EXLEY,844,"I don't hate White.  I really
don't.  It's just, in my business,
it's the wild cars you have to
watch out for."
845,LYNN,845,"You don't like that you don't know
how to play him.  He doesn't
follow the same rules of politics
you do.  That makes him dangerous."
846,EXLEY,846,"You cut to the heart of things,
don't you?  What about Lynn
Bracken?  She going to be a hooker
all her life?"
847,LYNN,847,"I came out here with a dream.
That's gone, but I settled for
reality."
848,EXLEY,848,Some reality.
849,LYNN,849,"No.  This is the means to the
reality.  But I'm not going to
tell you what it is."
850,EXLEY,850,Why not?
851,LYNN,851,"Because you'll use it against me.
Won't you?"
852,LYNN,852,"You're tougher than Bud thinks you
are."
853,EXLEY,853,"You're the first person to ever
call me tough."
854,LYNN,854,"Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty
tough, myself."
855,EXLEY,855,"You, me and White, huh?"
856,LYNN,856,"Actually, Bud's only tough on the
outside."
857,DUDLEY,857,"John Vincennes.  It's three A.M.,
lad."
858,JACK,858,"Two minutes, Dudley.  It's
important."
859,DUDLEY,859,"Lucky for you that my wife and
four fair daughters are at the
beach in Santa Barbara."
860,JACK,860,"You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?"
861,DUDLEY,861,"A disgrace as a policeman.
Straight D fitness reports from
every C.O. he ever served under.
What about him?"
862,JACK,862,"Twelve years ago he worked a vice
roust with Dick Stensland.  They
arrested a Pierce Patchett on an
extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers.
He'd have them photographed with
their johns, then double-dip for
some blackmail.  Charges got
dropped.  Insufficient evidence.
You were supervising officer on
the case and I was wondering if
you remember anything about it."
863,DUDLEY,863,"What's this all about, lad?"
864,JACK,864,"Part of it has to do with a
murder.  I've been working with Ed
Exley on it."
865,DUDLEY,865,"You're Narco, lad, not Homicide.
And since when do you work with
Edmund?"
866,JACK,866,"It's a private investigation.  I
fucked something up and I want to
make amends."
867,DUDLEY,867,"Don't start trying to do the right
thing, John.  You haven't had
enough practice."
868,DUDLEY,868,"Have you discussed this with
anyone else, John?"
869,JACK,869,No.
870,DUDLEY,870,Not even with Exley?
871,JACK,871,"Have you a valediction, lad?"
872,JACK,872,Rollo Tomasi...
873,DUDLEY,873,"Sergeant Vincennes' body was found
in Echo Park at ten o'clock this
morning.  Killed by a single .38
round to the heart.  One of our
own, gentlemen.  We cannot
tolerate it.  Justice must be
swift and merciless.  That's all."
874,DUDLEY,874,"Edmund, a word with you.  We
received a tip this morning.  Did
Vincennes ever mention the name
Rollo Tomasi?"
875,EXLEY,875,No... Where'd the tip come from?
876,DUDLEY,876,Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
877,DUDLEY,877,"You're perplexing to me these
days, Wendell.  You're not your
old, cruel self anymore.  I need
proof that the extracurricular
work I had planned for you remains
within your grasp."
878,BUD,878,What work?
879,DUDLEY,879,"I've long been involved in
containing hard crime in such a
way that myself and a few
colleagues might someday enjoy a
profit dispensation.  That day
will soon be here and you'll share
handsomely.  Grand means will be
in our hands, Wendell."
880,"(MORE)
DUDLEY (CONT'D)",880,"Imagine crime limited to the
criminal element who perpetrate
it. Imagine the means to keep the
nigger filth sedated.  But don't
stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine
the police in control.  It's big,
lad."
881,BUD,881,"You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know
what you're talking about."
882,DUDLEY,882,"You have your extracurricular
secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold
a clarification session soon.  For
now, I need your fearsome old
habits at the Victory Motel.
We're going to brace a man who may
know who killed Jack Vincennes.
Can I count on you?"
883,BUD,883,"Sure, boss.  Sure you can."
884,EXLEY,884,"I want to know what you and Jack
Vincennes talked about last night.
Anything and everything.  Start
with the I.D. on the corpse."
885,PINKER,885,"An ex-cop.  Buzz Meeks.  I pulled
his police academy photo."
886,EXLEY,886,"We got a dead ex-cop and a girl
who looks like Rita Hayworth at
the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop
under the house of Rita's mother.
It's not a good week for ex-cops."
887,PINKER,887,"I got Vincennes in the next room.
It's not a good week for cops in
general."
888,DUDLEY,888,"This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell."
889,HUDGEONS,889,"I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't
need to tie me down."
890,DUDLEY,890,"It's for your own safety.  Now
what can you tell us about
Sergeant John Vincennes?"
891,HUDGEONS,891,"Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can
tell you he's on the Night Train
to the big adios."
892,HUDGEONS,892,"Take it easy!  I didn't have
anything to do with him getting
killed if that's what you mean."
893,DUDLEY,893,But you were business associates?
894,HUDGEONS,894,What does that have to do --
895,HUDGEONS,895,"Okay so we worked together.  It
was an information exchange.  I
got him first class collars and he
got me good stories.  We were
friends for Chrissakes!"
896,DUDLEY,896,"Alright.  We'll drop that line for
now.  Next topic.  Please comment
on Pierce Patchett."
897,HUDGEONS,897,"You think he had something to do
with Vincennes getting iced?"
898,DUDLEY,898,"Wendell.  I want full and docile
cooperation on all topics."
899,HUDGEONS,899,"Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows
Patchett's worth a boat-load of
greenbacks.  From aviation,
freeway construction.  But the man
has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B
movies under the table and runs
movie star look-alike hookers.
And try this on:  he's rumored to
be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All
in all a powerful behind-the-
scenes strange-o."
900,DUDLEY,900,And?
901,HUDGEONS,901,And what?
902,DUDLEY,902,"Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the
key to all relationships."
903,HUDGEONS,903,"He runs call girls.  Primo tail.
Fixed up like movie stars."
904,DUDLEY,904,And?
905,HUDGEONS,905,"In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The
trunk under the carpet.  Patchett
got me to photograph a cop fucking
this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks
just like Veronicaaa --"
906,DUDLEY,906,Wendell!
907,HUDGEONS,907,Get him away from me!
908,DUDLEY,908,"I wouldn't trade places with
Edmund Exley right now for all the
tea in China."
909,HUDGEONS,909,"Dudley, I thought you were gonna
let the dumb bastard kill me."
910,HUDGEONS,910,"And you!  Learn to pull those
punches a little better."
911,HUDGEONS,911,"You can uncuff me now, fellas."
912,HUDGEONS,912,Fellas?
913,HUDGEONS,913,"We had a deal.  You, me and
Patchett,  We're a team!"
914,HUDGEONS,914,"Come on, we're friends.  We're --"
915,DUDLEY,915,Hush-hush...
916,EXLEY,916,Anything?
917,CLERK,917,Nothing.
918,EXLEY,918,"So on active duty, Meeks didn't
make an arrest from 1938 to '43."
919,CLERK,919,"Someone must've pulled the
records."
920,EXLEY,920,"Where are the police academy
files?"
921,CLERK,921,I don't have time.  I have --
922,EXLEY,922,Just show me where they are!
923,BUD,923,Did you talk to Exley?
924,LYNN,924,"Come in out of the rain.  In the
morning we'll have both our
stories for breakfast."
925,BUD,925,I want to know about Exley.
926,LYNN,926,"He's the opposite of you.  He's
more like me.  Cold, calculating."
927,BUD,927,"How'd you get to know so much
about him?"
928,LYNN,928,"Come in out of the rain, Bud."
929,BUD,929,"You gonna tell me what happened
with you and Exley?"
930,LYNN,930,We talked.
931,BUD,931,So tell me about it.
932,LYNN,932,In the morning.
933,BUD,933,No.  Now.
934,BUD,934,You fucked him.
935,LYNN,935,"I thought I was helping you.  I
thought --"
936,EXLEY,936,Why?
937,BUD,937,Lynn.
938,EXLEY,938,She told you?
939,EXLEY,939,"Who told you?  Did Dudley have
anything to do with you finding
out?"
940,EXLEY,940,"Listen to me.  Dudley killed Jack.
It has something to do with Buzz
Meeks."
941,EXLEY,941,"Look.  Dudley and Meeks go way
back.  Stensland, too."
942,EXLEY,942,"Think, goddamn you.  Think..."
943,BUD,943,"I knew Stensland and Meeks knew
each other.  Meeks was with Sue
Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The
night I met Lynn.  Lefferts'
mother I.D.ed Stensland as
Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens
pretended he didn't know either
one of them."
944,EXLEY,944,"Stensland and Meeks.  What were
they up to?"
945,BUD,945,"Johnny Stompanato told me when
Meeks disappeared, he was trying
to move the 18 pounds of heroin
that went missing when Deuce
Perkins was shot."
946,EXLEY,946,"triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen
lieutenants.  When they killed
Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as
a bonus."
947,BUD,947,"Then something goes wrong.  Meeks
gets killed.  Maybe Stens got
greedy, killed Meeks and left him
under his girlfriend's house."
948,BUD,948,"The night he died, Stens was all
mysterious.  Said he had something
big going down."
949,EXLEY,949,"The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going
there to sell the heroin."
950,BUD,950,"Somebody got wind of it, killed
them all."
951,EXLEY,951,"It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith
Park report was a phony. And, who
says the purple Merc was spotted
outside the Nite Owl?"
952,BUD,952,Dudley.
953,EXLEY,953,"The first guys to the car when
Jack and I got there were Bruening
and Carlisle."
954,BUD,954,Dudley's guys.
955,EXLEY,955,"They didn't find the shotguns.
They planted them."
956,BUD,956,"It all keeps coming back to
Dudley."
957,EXLEY,957,It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
958,EXLEY,958,"Pierce Patchett figures in, too.
That's the angle Jack was working.
Dudley must work for Patchett."
959,BUD,959,Let's just kill them.
960,EXLEY,960,What?
961,BUD,961,"For Jack, for Stensland, for
anybody else who got in the way.
I've been trying to be smart.  A
detective.  But killing those two
fuckers, that would be justice."
962,EXLEY,962,"Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case.
We play by the rules."
963,BUD,963,"There are no rules!  Why the fuck
are you doing this?  The Nite Owl
made you.  You want to tear all
that down."
964,EXLEY,964,"With a wrecking ball.  You want to
help me swing it?"
965,EXLEY,965,"Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run
a good-cop-bad-cop."
966,BUD,966,"Which one are you and which one am
I?"
967,EXLEY,967,You expecting problems?
968,BUD,968,"Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop
muscle."
969,BUD,969,Come on.
970,EXLEY,970,What?
971,EXLEY,971,"I don't think his ex-cop did him
much good."
972,EXLEY,972,"It's a suicide note.  Says he
killed Jack because Jack had
figured out a pornography scam
Patchett was running."
973,BUD,973,"He had help getting up there.  Two
of his fingers are broken."
974,EXLEY,974,"We had one thing figured wrong.  I
don't think Dudley workd for
Patchett."
975,BUD,975,At least not anymore.
976,EXLEY,976,"Patchett's dead.  He sent you
after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying
up his loose ends."
977,EXLEY,977,"I got a guy who owes me in the
Sheriff's department.  West
Hollywood station.  He can be at
her house in two minutes."
978,BUD,978,Call him.
979,EXLEY,979,Is she inside?
980,DEPUTY,980,"We took her to Hollywood Station
for safekeeping.  Someone worked
her over pretty good.  She
wouldn't say who."
981,EXLEY,981,"Hold her as Joan Smith.  No one
sees her unless I okay it."
982,DEPUTY,982,"You got it, Exley.  And now we're
even."
983,EXLEY,983,Ellis Loew.
984,BUD,984,What about him?
985,EXLEY,985,"Jack thought he was up to his neck
in all this."
986,SECRETARY,986,You can't go in there!
987,SECRETARY,987,"Do you want me to call the police,
Mr. Loew?"
988,EXLEY,988,"Ask for Captain Dudley Smith.
We'll have a party.  Hot dogs and
sauerkraut."
989,LOEW,989,It's okay.  These are police.
990,EXLEY,990,"I want D.A. bureau men to tail
Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a
day; I want you to get a judge to
authorize a wire tap on his home
phone; I want authorization to
check his bank records and I want
it all in an hour."
991,LOEW,991,On what evidence?
992,EXLEY,992,None.  Call it a hunch.
993,LOEW,993,"Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a
highly decorated member of this
city's police department and I
won't smear his name without --"
994,EXLEY,994,"Without what, his smearing yours
first?  What's he got on you,
Loew?  Pictures of you and an out
of work actor with your pants
down?"
995,LOEW,995,Do you have any proof?
996,EXLEY,996,The proof had his throat slit.
997,EXLEY,997,So far you're not denying it.
998,LOEW,998,"I'm not going to dignify youwith
answers.  If you'll excuse me,
I've got a Jack Vincennes press
conference to prepare for."
999,LOEW,999,"Unless you're here to wipe my ass,
I think we're through."
1000,LOEW,1000,"Don't try this good cop/bad cop
with me.  I practically
invented it.  And so what if some
homo actor is dead.  Boys, girls,
ten of them step off the bus to
L.A. every day."
1001,BUD,1001,Dudley Smith.  Spill.
1002,LOEW,1002,"Call him off, Exley!"
1003,EXLEY,1003,I don't know how.
1004,EXLEY,1004,Bud...
1005,BUD,1005,"If I let you go, there'll be ten
more lawyers to take your place
tomorrow.  They just won't come on
the bus, that's all."
1006,LOEW,1006,"Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got
photos of me and Reynolds."
1007,EXLEY,1007,What's Dudley's scheme?
1008,LOEW,1008,"Dudley's rotten to the core.  He's
taking over Mickey Cohen's
rackets, his own hand-picked
cops'll be the new franchise
holders.  Because of those
pictures I won't be able to
prosecute.  Oh Jesus pull me up!"
1009,LOEW,1009,"Dudley's got everyone under his
thumb.  Not just me, but the Chief
of Police, the lieutenant
governor, everybody!"
1010,EXLEY,1010,"and Officer White visits you alone
next time."
1011,BUD,1011,"They never made a match on the
shotgun serial numbers.  What if
Breuning and Carlisle took them
from the evidence room?  Couple of
cold pieces that had been hanging
around a year or two."
1012,EXLEY,1012,"We should check the records, and,
we should talk to Lynn."
1013,EXLEY,1013,You want to talk to her?
1014,BUD,1014,You do it.  I'll check the files.
1015,LYNN,1015,"If I knew you were coming I'd have
baked a cake."
1016,EXLEY,1016,"Forget everything else for a
second, Lynn.  Is there anything
you can give me on Dudley Smith?"
1017,EXLEY,1017,"A police captain.  I think he's
behind all of this."
1018,LYNN,1018,"I work for Patchett.  I had a
feeling that there was someone
else, but I never knew who."
1019,EXLEY,1019,"Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud
hates himself for what he did."
1020,LYNN,1020,I know how he feels.
1021,EXLEY,1021,"I don't know if it's pathetic or
romantic, but when this is all
over I'd like to see you again."
1022,RECORDER,1022,"I got your guns, Bud.  Signed in
April 3rd, 1950.  Remember the
First Western bank robbery?  They
were used in that."
1023,BUD,1023,I want to see them.
1024,RECORDER,1024,No can do.  I can't find them.
1025,ROOKIE-TYPE,1025,Uh -- Sergeant White?
1026,ROOKIE-TYPE,1026,"Dispatch just got a call for you.
Lieutenant Exley wants you to meet
him at the Victory Motel."
1027,BUD,1027,You wanted to meet here?
1028,EXLEY,1028,"Me?  You called it.  I got a
message that..."
1029,EXLEY,1029,Shit... Come on.
1030,BUD,1030,Too late.
1031,BUD,1031,Here.
1032,EXLEY,1032,"You figured this was a set-up?
And you showed up anyway?"
1033,BUD,1033,"A lot of bad stuff happened here.
It's as good a place as any for it
to end."
1034,EXLEY,1034,"You know, all I ever wanted was to
measure up to my father."
1035,BUD,1035,"I spent years trying not to live
down to mine."
1036,"(MORE)
BUD (CONT'D)",1036,"We should block off the bathroom.
They could come through --"
1037,EXLEY,1037,We got him!
1038,EXLEY,1038,"I'm thinking we might walk away
from this."
1039,DUDLEY,1039,"I'm loathe to kill my brother
officers, Edmund."
1040,EXLEY,1040,"Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To
Stensland."
1041,DUDLEY,1041,"Jack was a shame, but Dick
Stensland had the audacity to try
to sell me my own heroin.  Through
his whore girl friend.  I sent him
to make the buy.  The rest is
history."
1042,EXLEY,1042,Why?
1043,DUDLEY,1043,"A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we
have in Los Angeles.  Sending
Mickey Cohen up created it.  My
containment work maintained it.
Certain photographs guarantee it.
Organized crime has been held
back, but there's still a demand
for the services it provides."
1044,EXLEY,1044,And now you'll provide them.
1045,DUDLEY,1045,"Absolutely.  Prostitution and
gambling are victimless crimes.
The heroin we'll run down to the
coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As
long as it's not a middle class
problem, no one will care.  It's
still a crime free city... for
respectable people."
1046,DUDLEY,1046,"This isn't politics, Edmund.
There won't be winners and losers
when it's over..."
1047,DUDLEY,1047,"Just the living and the dead.
It's always been that way in the
Bureau.  You should've realized
that before you became a
detective."
1048,DUDLEY,1048,We're policemen!
1049,DUDLEY,1049,"Let me do the talking.  They'll
make you Chief of Detectives."
1050,DUDLEY,1050,"Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?"
1051,EXLEY,1051,Something like that.
1052,DUDLEY,1052,"rig crime scene evidence to
support a prosecuting attorney's
working hypothesis?"
1053,DUDLEY,1053,"Would you be willing to beat
confessions out of suspects you
knew to be guilty?"
1054,DUDLEY,1054,"Are you willing to shoot hardened
criminals in the back to offset
the chance they'll --"
1055,INTERNAL AFFAIRS #1,1055,"You have a lot of explaining to
do, Lieutenant."
1056,EXLEY,1056,Yes.  I do.
1057,EXLEY,1057,"That's it.  That's the whole
story."
1058,LOEW,1058,"The press would have a field day
with this."
1059,CHIEF,1059,"When in doubt, feed them a hero.
In this case, we'll need more than
one."
1060,CHIEF,1060,"Captain Edmund Exley.  Chief of
Detectives.  Los Angeles Police
Department."
1061,EXLEY,1061,"I tried to throw it all away and
they give it back in spades."
1062,EXLEY,1062,Where will you go?
1063,LYNN,1063,"Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good
for pensioners and I know where
everything is."
1064,EXLEY,1064,When?
1065,LYNN,1065,"Right now, before I back down."
1066,EXLEY,1066,Where is he?
1067,EXLEY,1067,Thanks for the push.
1068,EXLEY,1068,"You just did what you did.  No
rank, no glory."
1069,EXLEY,1069,"From me to you.  It'll mean
something if it's yours."
1070,LYNN,1070,We should go now.
1071,EXLEY,1071,"Do you think I ever could've been
in the running?"
1072,LYNN,1072,"Some men get the world.  Others
get ex-hookers and a trip to
Arizona."
