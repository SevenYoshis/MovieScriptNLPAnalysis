Her eyes are closed in\nsleep, or in death ... or in something in between.\nNow TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness.  They are\nmale, and they float into position on either side of the\nfemale.  They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,\nand like the female their eyes are closed.\nThe ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch.  Her features,\nwhich have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,\ninto the face of a woman in fear.  Her eyes open.\nThe male face on her right contorts too.  His features warp\ninto an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged.  His eyes\nopen.\nThe male face on her left takes on the expression of a young\nboy, a boy who is terribly frightened.  His eyes open wide.\nAs if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a\nsudden and unnerving exchange begins ..."

The car automatically brakes to a\nhalt.  The man looks around the edge of his paper to see\nwhat is happening.\nTHE STREET\nThe car has stopped, inches from the girl.\nThe girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink.\nShe waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball.\n4.\nThe man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on\nits own, starts up again.  The car rounds a corner, and\ndisappears.\nINSIDE THE HOUSE\nCarol turns away from the window.  She startles when she\nsees her husband, JOHNNY, is there behind her.  He is in his\npajamas.  How long has he been there, watching her?"

He walks down\nhis front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper.\nCarol stands in the doorway, watching him.\nA SHADOW slides over Johnny, cast from above.  The air fills\nwith the piercing WHINE of an engine.  Johnny looks up,\nalarmed.\nIn the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban\ntrees, is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT.\nThe children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone\nfreezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable\ndrama.\nRacing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him, are SLEEK\nTECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS, lethal and efficient looking -- they\nseem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat\nFords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to\nprocess them.\n5.\nHelmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.\nMore police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses.  Their\nuniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light.  Their\nleft hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some\nsort of complicated glove.\nCLOSE\nON - A GLOVE\nThe glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger\nending in an open barrel.\nClearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not\nAmerica in the 1950's.  It is the neo-past, the retro world\nof America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is\nintermeshed with hypertechnology.\nAnd all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he\nmakes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering\nbehind him.  He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out\nof the way.\nEight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a\nbackpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a\nhandle grip and an ovoid screen.  It is a holographic scanner.\nHe activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an\nIDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form.\nThe two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver\na dozen times.\nIn less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three\ndimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning\nlike living beings -- has been created.  An overwhelming\npolice deterrent presence has been established.\nINSIDE THE HOUSE\nThe Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house,\ntoo.  It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and\nwhich are scanned holographs.  The juxtaposition of the\nfuturistic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.\nINSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET\nJohnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his\nwife's dresses.\nUPSTAIRS HALLWAY\nTwo OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands\nout in front of them, palm out.  When the first officer points\nhis palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove\nBEEPS softly.\n6.\nThe officer looks at his PALM.  A red thermal IMAGE appears\non a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching\nman.  The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second\nofficer.\nTHE BEDROOM\nThe room is packed with police -- how many are real?\nTHE CLOSET\nJohnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat.  He calls\nout through the door."
