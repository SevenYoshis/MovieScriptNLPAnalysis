   "text": "\"ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN\"\nby\nWilliam Goldman\nBased on the novel\n\"All The President's Men\"\nby\nCarl Bernstein and Bob Woodward\nPre-rehearsal version March, 1975\nStart with as few credits as possible. When they're over--\nFADE IN ON:\nA TINY BLACK PIECE OF TAPE.\nWe see it in the center of the large, dimly lit screen. As\nthe tape is pressed around a door--\nBEGIN THE BREAK-IN SEQUENCE.\nIt's a major piece of action, running maybe five minutes and\nit's all as detailed and accurate as we can make it, with as\nmany \"if only's\" included as possible. (\"If only\" the tape\nhad been attached up and down instead of around the door,\nWills wouldn't have spotted it and alerted the police; \"if\nonly\" the first police car called had gone to investigate,\nBaldwin, watching from the Howard Johnson Motor Inn, would\nhave seen their uniforms and radioed Hunt and Liddy in time\nfor them to have gotten to the five burglars and then safely\naway.)\nThe break-in ends when Leeper arrests the five men. He thought\nhe only had one guy, so when ten hands were raised he was\nsurprised. The hands are all encased in Playtex rubber\nsurgical gloves. HOLD on the hands a moment; then--\nGO TO:\nA DARK APARTMENT.\nThe phone rings. WOODWARD fumbles for the receiver, turns on\nthe bed light. He listens a moment."
