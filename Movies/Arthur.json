MANHATTAN - NIGHT\nA HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top\nbroker this time last year, is picking through a bin in\nManhattan's deserted night-time financial district.\nThe street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches.\nA huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S\nBATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the\nwrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover.\nBAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars.\nWe hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches\nand careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'.\nSirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit.\nThe Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New\nYork Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's\nsteps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of\nthe famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze\ntesticles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away.\nThe cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER\nCOPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn.\nA HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light."
