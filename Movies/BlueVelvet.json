It is a HUMAN EAR, covered with crawling ants.\nJeffrey immediately stands up and looks around.  All he sees are houses\n- some laundry drying - a very peaceful scene.  No one seems to be around -\nNo one seems to be watching him.\nHe looks again at the ear.\nWe are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it.\nThere is dried blood on part of it.\nJeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig, he pushes the ear onto\nit.  Again, he stands up and looks around.\nIN THE DISTANCE, a MAN goes into the back door of a house.  Nothing more.\nJeffery hurries off, carrying the bag with the ear in it."
