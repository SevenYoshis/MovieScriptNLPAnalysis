A jungle army.\nBoys.\nChris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters. Transfers the\nmachete to his other, slightly less blistered, hand.  The kid\ncuts on - struggling but trying, on his last reserves of\nstrength, smashing almost straight forward through brush, not\neven bothering to look ahead.  He smells something, looks around,\nslows his pace, eyes working ... around to the base of a tree.\nHe moves past it.\nAnd as he does so, the camera from his POV comes around on a dead\ndecomposing 10-day-old GOOK - eyes starting from its sockets,\nworms and flies feasting.\nChris draws his breath in, terrified.

Pleading with Tex to\nwake up, but out of reach.  He is about to have an anxiety\nattack, his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hear him.\nThe first figure is now directly in front of Chris on the trail,\nlooking left and right.  A rattle of his equipment, a creak of\nleather.  A smell.  The man's face now catches the moonlight and\nhis eyes come around on Chris.\nOriental eyes.  Looking right at him.  Startled.  Chris staring\nback, hypnotized.  It all happens very fast.  The figure murmurs\nsomething in Vietnamese.  A warning.  He swivels.\nA flash of muzzle fire.  A raking cough of automatic fire.  A\ngrenade explosion.\nChris is hurled to the ground, helmet bouncing off, scattered,\nconfused, jarred.

That sad\nyoung look - as if death itself would've been a release.  Chris\nturns his eyes away, an awkward sense of shame."
