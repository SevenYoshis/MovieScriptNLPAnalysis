The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to\ntheir shoulders.\nANOTHER ANGLE\nRocky's and Apollo's fans are aggressively competing against\neach other... chanting, 'Creed, Creed, Creed.'\nRocky's fans counter by bellowing, 'Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.'\nANOTHER ANGLE\nPaulie tries to get to Rocky but is shoved aside and he\nstarts swinging.\nANOTHER ANGLE\nBoth Rocky and Apollo are completely at the mercy of the\ncrowd.  They are being passed overhead and remain helpless\nas their bodies float up the aisle on the sea of hands...\nThe CHANTING IS DEAFENING.\nANOTHER ANGLE\nFearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move\nforward.  Running headlong into the crowd, she angles\nthrough the mass to get to Rocky.\nANOTHER ANGLE\nShe is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions,\nbut she keeps her feet... She sees him.  In the distance,\nRocky floats INTO VIEW and Adrian flattens against the wall\nand waits for the procession to pass.\nThe procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's\nunbelievably battered but smiling face.  He appears to be\nking of the world.\nThe procession approaches and passes Adrian.  She jumps on\nher toes and waves frantically but is not seen.  She screams\nRocky's name... Somehow the delicate voice knifes through\nthe racket and reaches Rocky.\nRocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages\nto see Adrian jumping up and down waving.  The crowd is\ncarrying him away.  He attempts to lower himself but the\ncrowd won't permit it.\n121.\nRocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's\nheads and shoulders.  He resembles a man trying to go up a\ndown escalator.  People are jammed so tightly together Rocky\nmanages to crawl across them to Adrian.\nStill suspended in air, Rocky leans down and Adrian jumps up\nand they lock in an embrace."
