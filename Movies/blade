They make a\ngame of it, shoving him from one person to another, their pale faces\nleering like twisted jack-o-lanterns.\nThe strobe lights quicken to a seizure-inducing intensity. Dennis\nspins, tumbling into Raquel's arms. She shoves him forward -- Dennis\nlands on the floor, falling at someone's boot-clad feet. He looks up.\nA DARK FIGURE sits in the shadows, unnoticed until this moment. The\nfigure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt --\nA BLACK MAN,\ntowers above Dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat -- a\nsneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of\nhorror. His name is BLADE.\nBlade whips open his long coat, shrugging it off, revealing an\narsenal of high-tech weapons strapped to his body:\n6-point adjustable body armor, a modified CAR-15 assault rifle with\nan ultra-violet entry light, two Casull .454 revolvers, a \"Demon\"\nautomatic cross-bow, a bandoleer of mahogany stakes, an Indian-style\nkatar punching dagger -- and last, but certainly not least, his\nnamesake -- a silver sword which is secured in a back-scabbard.\nCLOSE ON BLADE\nA gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. The vampire club-goers\nstare back. Nuclear silence. And then --\nAll hell breaks loose. With a SNARL, Raquel charges at Blade, moving\nat superhuman speed, practically a blur --\nBlade draws his Casulls, FIRES in multiple directions --\nMACRO BULLET SHOT\nas a round roars through the air towards Raquel. A silver-tipped dum-\ndum bullet which explodes on contact.\nWHAM! The round punches a fist-sized hole through Raquel's chest,\ncontinuing on into the vamp behind her! Vampire blood fountains. Both\ncreatures tumble forward, their bodies liquefying into puddles of\nblack oil which go gurgling down the run-off drains.\nBlade continues FIRING, then -CLICK!- magazines empty. Next. He\nholsters the Casulls, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on\nthe UV entry light mounted above --\nMERCURY\nleaps twenty feet straight up into the air. We've never seen anything\nmove so fast. She CRASHES through a glass skylight, disappearing into\nthe night just as --\n-- a shaft of blinding UV \"sunlight\" cuts across the vampires. They\nrear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. Blade\nopens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets\ninto the crowd -- vampire genocide.\nThe strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. Some of the vampires\ntry to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes\nclogged with liquefying bodies --\n-- then Blade's CAR-15 jams. The remaining club-goers see their\nopening, surge forward en masse --\nBlade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHINGGG!-\nunsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip.\nTHE SWORD\nFour acid-etched feet of blood-soaked Damascus steel. An edge so\nsharp it could cleave a shadow in two.\nBlade moves like lightning, hacking his way into TWO CHARGING\nVAMPIRES. Blade spins again, cuts ANOTHER VAMPIRE clean in half --\nON THE FAR END OF THE CLUB,\na LATEX-CLAD VAMP makes a break for it. Blade flings his sword,\nsending it spinning end over end -- THUNK! The sword punches into the\nvampire's heart. The hellish creature convulses, dies.\nBeat. Blade retrieves his sword, then senses --\nSOMETHING BIG\nrising up behind him. In a flash, Blade swings his sword downward,\ncutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. The severed limb\nfalls to the floor --\n-- but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. It SLAMS into\nBlade. Blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables,\nslamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the\nceiling.\nBlade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot-\nsomething nightmare named QUINN. The vampire rears back its head,\njaws stretching wide. Every inch of his face is covered with ritual\nscarification patterns and Maori-like tribal tattoos.\nBlade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at\nbay. With his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a\nstake -- CRUNCH! Blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx.\nQuinn gurgles, clutches at his throat.\nBlade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross-bow secured to his\nleg. With a flick of a switch the arms of the bow -SNAP!- open,\ndrawing the bow-string taut. Blade FIRES --\nThe bolt hits Quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and\nnailing him to the wall. As Quinn reaches over with his other hand to\npull out the stake --\nBlade FIRES AGAIN. A second bolt slams into Quinn's other arm,\neffectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board.\nUP ABOVE,\nmounted in one of the corners, is a security camera. Blade fires a\ncross-bow bolt straight into the lens.\nBlade strides over, placing his sword against Quinn's chest."
