It suddenly explodes with a\nresounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR\nswings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE\nrings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking\nit off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his\nback to the camera, phone in hand."
