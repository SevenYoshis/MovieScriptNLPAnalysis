Bringing up the rear are five Yagua\nINDIANS. They act as porters and are wrangling the two heavily-\npacked llamas. The Indians become increasingly nervous. They\nspeak to each other in bursts of Quechua. The American, who\nis known to his friends as Indy, glances back at them."

Halfway out, he sees something on the floor and kneels\nto look at it.\nA dead bird lies on one of the white tiles. Its body is\nriddled with little deadly darts. This has great significance\nto Indy and he stands with even greater caution. He waves\nthe torch ahead of him and at waist height an air current\nwhips at the flame. Indy ducks under it and leaves a burn\nmark on the white tile beneath it.\nSatipo watches, wide-eyed and mystified.\nIndy reaches the altar. The tiny idol looks both fierce and\nbeautiful.

Now, just before entering the tunnel, he looks in the\nside view mirror and sees the Nazis on his side. A quick\nglance to the other mirror reveals the others. As the truck\nsweeps into the tunnel, we see Indy just start to turn his\nsteering wheel - he is going to sideswipe the walls of the\ntunnel\nAt the other end of the tunnel, we hear the roar of the two\nengine and two long, screeching, scraping sounds. The lead\nstaff car shoots out of the tunnel, then the truck, its sides\ncleaned of Nazis.\nIn the rear of the truck, the Tough Sergeant is looking with\ndistaste back at the tunnel. There remains only him and two\nArmed Nazis with the Ark. He sends these two climbing up\nover the top of the truck.\nIn the lead car, the Blond Driver is being pressed hard by\nIndy, who now edges up to bump them from the rear. Suddenly\nthe Armed Guard next to the Driver sees the two Armed Nazis\nappear on the top of the truck.

Then he figures it out and slams\non his brakes. The brakes lock, the wheels burn and the truck\nskids to a dusty halt. The two Armed Nazis fly off the truck,\nover the cab to the road in front. Indy immediately hits the\ngas again.

Indy is\nunaware. Belloq and Shliemann exchange looks. Then Shliemann\nyells to the Armed Guard in the front seat.\nThe Tough Sergeant has a line on Indy. He points his gun.\nThe Armed Guard blasts away at the truck. The Tough Sergeant\ndies in a hail of bullets and flies off.\nIndy, who has ducked at the gunfire, is confused. But when\nhe sees the Armed Guard up front lower his gun, Indy again\nfloors it and begins bumping the staff car in earnest.\nThe road is almost down to a level now. In the distance -\nCairo. The road takes a little dogleg just before reaching\nlevel ground again. Just as the staff car is about to make\nthe turn, Indy smashes them from behind. The staff car flies\noff the road and down a twenty foot embankment. Indy takes\nthe truck speeding down the road and off toward Cairo.\nIn the staff car, the occupants are bruised but safe.\nShliemann points at the departing truck and yells at the\nBlond Driver.

The only human: a\nNazi Sentry dressed as a Greek peasant. He is perched on a\npile of seed bags which are stacked at the very end of the\ntrain tracks. As the mine car barrels noisily down toward\nhim, he throws away some burlap to reveal a mounted machine\ngun which he spins quickly around toward the approaching\nmine car. He opens fire.\nIn the out-of-control mine car, Indy pulls Marion down with\nhim. They are squashed into the corner trying to avoid contact\nwith the bouncing Ark. Bullets clang against the outside of\nthe car and whiz inches overhead. Indy and Marion are forced\ninto a tighter and tighter embrace of life.\nAt the machine gun post, the Nazi Sentry has been firing\nlike crazy, but now there is terror in his eyes. He realizes\nthe car is not going to stop. He lacks faith in his\nstronghold. Too late.\nThe mine car smashes into the seed bag bunker. And right on\nthrough. The Nazi Sentry, his machine gun and a dozen bursting\nseed bags are slammed into the ocean in a wild, hurtling\nmass. The mine car jumps, bounces and spins around, then\nslides to a stop in a cloud of seed at the edge of the water."

We can\nrecognize that the small opening high on the slope from which\na cloud of smoke and dust is billowing is the end of the\nmine tunnel. And there below it, quite small from this\ndistance is the dock. And the boat that looks like a Greek\nfishing boat. There can be no mistake even from this far\naway - the boat is chugging out to sea."
