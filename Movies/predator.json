Drawing closer, the SOUND of\npowerful TURBINES, throbbing in the heavy air, becomes\ndominant, overpowering.\nGuided by COLORED SMOKE and LANDING LIGHTS, the chopper\nlooms hard INTO VIEW, pitching forward and settling to\nthe ground, kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation\n2-A   INT.

He's losing ground.  He knows he's going\nto die.\nSchaefer SHOUTS.  Suddenly the ground before him\nCOLLAPSES and he disappears from sight.\n149     EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY                               149\nIn a shower of leaves, flailing arms and legs, Schaefer\ncrashes through the trees at the canyon's edge, free\nfalling into space.\n(CONTINUED)\n83\n149     CONTINUED:                                           149\nWith a sickening IMPACT, he hits the branches of the\nfirst trees lining the canyon and falls, a hundred feet,\nthrough one canopy after another, desperately grabbing\nfor limbs and branched to break his fall.\nHe hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees,\nimpacting crosschest on a large BRANCH, knocking his\nwind out.\nSemi-conscious, he hangs momentarily before he slides\noff, fingers digging into the bark, falling another ten\nfeet into the swiftly moving river.\n150     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     150\nWeighted down by his boots and clothing, Schaefer\nstruggles to stay afloat.  Gasping for air he ducks\nunderwater, untying one of his boots.  He surfaces,\nfills his lungs and dives again, releasing the other\nboot.  He surfaces, strips off his shirt and pants and\nbegins to swim towards shore, stroking with one arm.\n151     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           151\nAs he nears the edge of the precipice from which\nSchaefer has fallen.  The Hunter in close pursuit does\nnot hesitate but LAUNCHES himself off the cliff in\na spectacular LEAP, streaking downward towards the tops\nof the trees that grow out from the canyon wall.\nThe Hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree,\nthe branches and leaves rushing past in a KALEIDOSCOPIC\nBLUR.\nThe Hunter bounds off of one branch after another,\nmoving through the trees as an expert skier might\nnegotiate a series of downhill gates.\nThe Hunter leaps free of one tree, bounds across twenty\nfeet of open space to a large branch of a huge tree,\naffording a good view of the river below.  From his\nvantage point, looking down at the windening, slowing\nexpanse of river, Schaefer is nowhere to be seen.\n152     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  152\nHe is swept into a still FASTER CURRENT and is carried\nhelplessly downstream.

POOL AT BASE OF FALLS - DAY                     153\nThere is no sign of Schaefer.  Precious seconds pass.\nSlowly, looking like a drowned rat, he surfaces, taking\na feeble breath.  He is nearly finished, his energy\nsapped.  But the water is calm and a few strokes are\nenough to carry him near the shore.  His feet hit\nbottom.\nHe tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick\nMUD SLURRY at the river bank.  With his last ounce of\nstrength, he crawls, panting and gasping into a\nsheltered mud OVERHANG, collapsing beside the exposed\nROOT-SYSTEM OF A DEAD TREE, his body completely covered\nin thick, gray MUD.\nNearly unconscious, he raises his head and looks to the\nopposite side of the river, scanning the bank.  There is\nno sign of the Hunter.  He collapses in relief.  He's\nescaped.\nSuddenly, the Hunter impacts the water, throwing up a\nhuge SPLASH.  He stands up in the waist deep water.  As\nthe water streams off of his body, the chameleon effect\nrapidly changes, struggling to match the shifting color\npatterns of the shimmering water.\nHis glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where\nSchaefer lies helplessly trapped.\nThe Hunter surges forward, relentlessly closing in on\nthis prey.\n154     SCHAEFER                                             154\nis frozen in terror, paralyzed with fear, his eyes\nlocked ontothe incredible creature that is about to\nkill him.\n155     EXT. HUNTER - DAY                                    155\nClosing rapidly, another ten feet.  He leaves the water\nand walks through the mud, stopping, towering over\nSchaefer.\n85\n156     EXT. SCHAEFER'S P.O.V. - DAY                         156\nAs the Hunter's feet surge though the mud and stop,\nthree feet away.\n157     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  157\nRealizing his life is about to end, closes his eyes,\nawaiting the Hunter's killing blow.\n158     EXT. HUNTER'S EYES - DAY                             158\nThe fierce yellow orbs look downward.\n159     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           159\nHe's looking directly at Schaefer, EXCEPT HE CAN'T\nSEE HIM.\nHe can clearly see the EXPOSED ROOT-SYSTEM, but because\nof the heavy mud blocking Schaefer's body heat, Schaefer\nregisters in the Hunter's vision as merely an indistinct\nlump of clay, unrecognizable to the Hunter as a human\nbeing.\nHe scans the bank, searching, looking for heat sources.\nDetecting none he moves on sounding a questioning TRILL\nseveral times.\n160     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               160\ndisbelieving that he's still alive, opens one eye,\nSEEING the Hunter's feet move away, his prehensile\nspurs dragging in the mud.  He rounds a bend and\ndisappears, heading for the undergrowth.\nAstonished, he tries to raise up on his hands but a\nsudden jabbing pain in his shoulder causes him to\ncollapse, falling onto his side, unconscious in the\nmud.\n161     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     161\nAs a HUEY ATTACK HELICOPTER breaks over the top of the\nridge, diving forward, moving down the canyon.  The\nchopper flares up into a holding pattern.\nIn the open doorway, a SOLDIER searches the top of\nthe canyon with binoculars.  Seeing no sign of life,\nthe chopper flies on, disappearing down the canyon\nrim.\n162     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               162\nlies unconscious in the mud, the distant SOUND of the\nhelicopter THRUMPING into the distance.\n86\n163     EXT. ANNA - DAY                                      163\nShe runs into a clearing, stopping momentarily, gasping\nfor breath.  She is startled by a sudden movement\nbehind her.  She spins, looking.  There is nothing\nthere.  She runs on.\n164     EXT. THE CANYON - DAY (DUSK)                         164\nSchaefer GASPS as his eyes bolt open in fear.  As if\nthe Hunter were still attacking, Schaefer rolls to his\nfeet and runs, slogging through the THICK MUD, stumbling,\nlunging forward, gasping for breath.\nSchaefer spins and staggers backwards into a shallow\nPOOL, scuttling, crablike into the chest deep water.\nSchaefer backs into the moss-covered wall by the\nwaterfall, looking for movement, regaining his senses.\nAs the water settles, he looks down, SEEING the image\nof himself, reflected in the pool; his hair and face\ncovered in THICK CLAY.  He stares, mesmerized at the\nimage.\nHe lifts his arm from the water, his fingers wiping the\nMUD from his face, exposing a PATCH of SKIN.  He studies\nthe mud in his hand and then looks at the image of\nhimself in the water, SEEING the exposed skin.  HE\nstares at it, a wave of realization rushing through\nhis mind.  He places the mud back on his face, again\nlooking at his image."

He kneels, tending to a pile of\nDRIES GRASS, LEAVES and other tinder.  Using the last of\nhis precious matches, he sets fire to the tinder, gently\ncoaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consumming FIRE,\nflames starting to lick upward through the dry wood.\nHe stands, staring into the rapidly growing blaze.
