   "text": "It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through\nthe jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the\ntrees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.\nOur VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to\nthe tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;\nthen another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to\nemerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set\nof beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet,\nin a psychedelic  hand, are the words: \"Gook Killer.\"\nThe head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier\nbeneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no\nshirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is\npainted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the\nright; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and\nslowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.\nOur VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though\nunrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.\nWe PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the\nswamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can\nin the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.\nAs we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow\nand houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted\nin a paisley design.\nNow the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST\nthe glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in\nambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.\nACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black\npajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.\nTheir feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make\nno sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of\neyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.\nThe VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER\nAND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front\nabout ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags\nand bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun\ncasually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles\nlaconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH\nUS. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out\nwith AUTOMATIC FIRE.\nOut VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,\nscreaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS\nappear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that\nwe fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.\nSome wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from\nfeathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long\nsavage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;\nthey wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.\nThey wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their\nbodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.\nThey appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US\nas they move.\nThe soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping\nmud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.\nWe begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly\nrunning for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,\nonly to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN\npainted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW\nFALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME\nand EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die\naround us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS\nare piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is\nfrightened.\nAn AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign\non it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down\nTOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the\ndead.\nOUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a\nVietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be\nstopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS\nwith primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth\nand green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US\nand the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,\nbright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,\nelectric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :\nMAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW\n2  TITLE SEQUENCE\nThe CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US,\ngrowing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;\ntransforming into an intense white heat that we can barely\nlook at, like the sun itself.\nThen it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once\nagain. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It\nis as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of\ncooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more\ndistant. The TITLES CONTINUE.\nWe are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the\nstars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the\nMUSIC  now.\nWe MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,\nas though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.\nWe are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,\nclose enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;\nCLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;\nLos Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like\nshapes of :\n3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY\nThe VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin\ncruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.\nIt is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in\nbathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking\ncocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the\nhead of a large American Corporation, and this is his\nparty. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to\ncatch some of the late sun. Others have their faces\nsmeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war\npaint. Charlie is going on and on :"
