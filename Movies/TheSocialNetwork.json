   "text": "Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for\nthe final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and\nprestigious Henley Royal Regatta.\nThe two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The\nport-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the\nIlollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a\npair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the \"H\" of\nHarvard.\nWe HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing\nsection. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot\n-- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n\nblazers and brightly colored floral ties.\nBut the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just\ntheir own breathing as they pull against the longest natural.\nstraight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half\ntorture test against the best competition they've ever faced.\nAnd they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the\nDutch.\nThe CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of\nthem can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late.\nMixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving\nthe flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of\nAmericans.\n124.\nWe'll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and latex\nwe'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next\nto him is their mother, who can barely watch.\nBack on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice\nthrough the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and\nthere's still no daylight between them.\nWe see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON's left hand begin\nto stream down his arm.\n25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy--\neven the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups\nthe closest race in the history of the competition. The 'ATH_PT'\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nis silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed--\nthe MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.\nThe blood that's covering CAMERON's left arm is being diluted\nby the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig,\nand pull, and pull, and pull, and---\nPOP!\n--the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of\nthe water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.\nCAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch\ngroup holding a giant flag and.jumping up and down. The\nAmericans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.\nThe two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug\nas the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.\nThe MOTHER drops her head-and looks down. The FATHER refuses\nto look away.\nFrom CAMERON and TYLER, just the'breathing.,"
