We\nmove from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO,\nuntil finally we begin to hear...\n...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN]\nWe settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing.\nThe driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on\nher radio -- then starts SINGING.\nThen -- she EXITS her car. Then -- she starts MOVING down the\nlane.\nOne by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING\nalong. Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL-\nFLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER...\nDrivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making\nuse of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. Arms\nswaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts.\nWe WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars,\ntaking the magic in...\nFinally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles --\nand the song comes to a dramatic stop.\nFlash title card:\nWINTER\nA1   We settle on a new car. A 1983 Dodge Riviera. In it is\nSEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. He's listening to the radio. He's\nplaying a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious\nMonk's \"Japanese Folk Song\". But he keeps stopping it, over\nand over and over -- always rewinding to the same exact spot."
