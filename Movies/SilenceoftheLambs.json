GRUBBY HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (DIMLY LIT)\nA woman's face BACKS INTO SHOT, her head resting against\ngrimy wallpaper. She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with\nconcentration. This is CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim,\nvery pretty. She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy\nwindbreaker, khaki pants. Her thick hair is piled under a\nnavy baseball cap. A revolver, clutched in her right hand,\nhovers by her ear. She raises a speedloader, in her left\nhand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads.\nCLOSE ON\nA guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its\nknob. Suddenly, wish a sharp CRACK!, the knob explodes, and\nthe door bursts open.\nWITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT\nas she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke. She\nshoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at\nthe ready in both hands...\nCUT TO:\nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY\nCLARICE'S POV - MOVING - as she first sees, sitting on the\nedge of a bed - a FEMALE HOSTAGE. Black, late 20's, gagged,\nhands behind her back. Then, SWIVELLING... she sees a startled\nMALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a\nrifle in his hands. He is turning towards her...\nClarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts."

Then another puzzling detail registers...\nTHE SUSPECT'S HANDS\nare taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use\nit even if he tried. Suddenly we hear a metallic CLICK, which\nregisters with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts,\ndrops to the floor, rolling sideways, and -\nTHE \"HOSTAGE\"\npulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in SLOW\nMOTION, raising it in her untied hands. She fires repeatedly,\nflames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar\nin these close quarters, but -\nClarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is\nalready firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send -\nTHE \"HOSTAGE\"\npitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still\nin a haze of gunsmoke. Clarice rushes to her, clamping one\nknee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case\nof movement. HOLD for a few beats... then we hear the shrill\nblast of a WHISTLE from somewhere, off screen, as normal\nACTION and SOUND are restored."
