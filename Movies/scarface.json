Within seventy-\ntwo hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed\nfor Cuba.   In the next few weeks, it\nbecame evident that Castro was forcing\nthe boat owners to carry back with\nthem not only their relatives but the\ndregs of his jail population. 3y the\ntime the port was closed 125,000\n'Marielitos' had landed in Florida.\nAn estimated 25,000 had criminal\nrecords.
