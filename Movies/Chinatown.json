He turns at a fork in\nthe road which allows him to continue following the flood\nchannel.\nFURTHER UP \u0096 MOVING\nThe road is narrower. Gittes drives more slowly. Foliage is\novergrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.\nSTILL FURTHER \u0096 NIGHT\nThe road is dirt. Heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus\nare everywhere. It is very still. Another turn and a pie-\nshaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be\nGLIMPSED.\nPOV \u0096 CHAIN-LINK FENCE\nOver the road, bolted. It says \"OAK PASS RESERVOIR. KEEP\nOUT. NO TRESPASSING.\"\nThe chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel\nand down into it, making access along the channel itself\nimpossible.\nGittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the\nspotlight.\nA lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole\nillumination.\nThere is only the eerie SOUND of the tension WIRES HUMMING.\nGittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood\nchannel itself.\nON THE OTHER SIDE\nGittes carefully works his way up through the thick Foliage\ntoward a second and large chain-link fence. Lights from the\nreservoir still higher above can be SEEN.\nSuddenly there is a GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. Gittes dives into\nthe flood control channel, which is at this point about four\nfeet deep and six feet wide. There is the SOUND of men\nscurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating.\nGittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.\nHe waits. The men seem to have passed him by. But there is\nanother SOUND now. An echoing growing sound. It puzzles\nGittes. He starts to lift his head to catch the direction.\nGITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL \u0096 NIGHT\nThen he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over\nhim, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging\ninto its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the\novergrowth to hang on and pull himself out. But the force of\nthe stream batters him and carries him with it until he's\nbrought rudely to the chainlink fence. It stops him cold.\nHe's nearly strained through it.\nSwearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing\nwater by means of the fence itself.\nDrenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and\nmakes his way toward his car.\nAT GITTES' CAR\nHe fishes for his car keys, looks down. One shoe is missing."
