Mad-\nmartigan ducks out of his way, hanging onto a post at\nthe edge of the tailgate.  The minion comes after him.\nSuddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off.\nThe jolt throws the minion off balance.  Madmartigan\nkicks him.  The minion hurtles off the taligate but\nholds on, dragged by the wagon.\nRool and Teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large\nwooden keg.  Together they yank it.  Untying the keg and\nsending it tumbling off the back.  The minion looks up\nin horror as the heavy keg crushes him.\nBut the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along\nwith one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins\nand looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them\nis the war chariot!\nThe Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the\nreins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to\ntwirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his\nhead.\nMadmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post.\nThe chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK!\nIt lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the\nchariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up\neach other.  At last Madmartigan lets go of the post\nand the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the\nairl, over a cliff to his death."
