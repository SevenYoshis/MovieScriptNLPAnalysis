PATRICK'S DAY\nDOWNTOWN BOSTON\nAs we open we see the inside of an enormous church. A young\nlooking PRIEST in his mid-thirties is finishing the delivery\nof the Lord\u0092s Prayer. In the back of the church, in the last\npew, there are two who kneel on the cold, stone floor.\nThey do not stand to sing, nor do they offer signs of peace\nwhen told, but they pray. They grip and rub their rosaries.\nThey mutter their words in Latin.\nCONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (mid-twenties) are shrouded in\nthick waist length navy P-coats, worn leather boots and the\nhungry clothes of the poor. The boys heads are shaved and\nthey have facial hair."

He is a very\ngood-looking, slender man.\nHe looks intently, for a moment, at four uniformed officers.\nThey approach two dead bodies, laying next to a dented green\ndumpster with half the paint job scraped off.\nOne man, IVAN CHECKOV, lays on his stomach, closer to the\ndumpster than the other. The ass of his pants has been burnt\nout and a large cotton bandage is in its place.\nThe other, VLADDY, has a blood soaked bandage around his\nhead and is on his stomach as well. There are hundreds of\npieces of porcelain of various sizes everywhere. Three plain-\nclothed homicide detectives, DUFFY, DOLLY and GREENLY hover\nclose to the bodies. Dolly and Duffy listen to GREENLY, an\nobvious rookie, give his over-confident theory of what took\nplace.\nThe chief is about to interrupt them, but Smecker holds him\nback with a smile.

A woman toward the end of the\nhall is so badly beaten she is unrecognizable.\nAs the song builds to a more harrowing chorus, a man enters.\nHis clothes suggest he's a pimp. He is not injured. He looks\naround as he stands, perturbed, at the end of the hall.\nHe reaches over and grabs the beat up woman by the hair and\nbegins to drag her out. She is kicking and screaming from\nthe floor, grabbing at his wrists as he hauls her away.\n(Slo-mo) The boys, instantly furious, stand and begin to go\ntoward the action, but Connor's legs give out on him and he\nfalls to the floor.
