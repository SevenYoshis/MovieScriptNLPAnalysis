ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.\nZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder\u0092s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can\u0092t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.\nOBI-WAN has jumped into the driver\u0092s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger\u0092s seat.\nANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM\u0092S hand. She grabs the Jedi\u0092s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of it\u0092s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter\u0092s speeder.\nJust as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street."

The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.\nAhead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.\nA nightclub sighs is flashing over the door.
