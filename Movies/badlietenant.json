LT plows his way through the CROWD, heading toward\nthe back of the club and the entrance to the V.I.P ROOM.\nEven this state, when he sights ACQUAINTANCES. LT turns on\nthe charm and works the room.\nLT nears the V.I.P. ROOM.\nPOV LT - The entrance to the V.I.P. ROOM is guarded by a\nPURPLE VELVET ROPE and an effete DOORMAN.\nWhen the DOORMAN sights LT, he lifts the ROPE, nods\nrespectfully at the habitual patron.\nCUT TO:\nINT: EVENING - LIMELIGHT NIGHTCLUB - THE V.I.P. ROOM\nLT arrives.\nThe V.I.P. ROOM is more laid-back, less populous than the\nthrong-filled cave outside. The MUSIC is muted here, and\nmore interesting.\nPARTIERS sit at the BAR, or at COCKTAIL TABLES. CHIC WAITRONS\nserve the clientele: HOTSHOT BOHEMIAN REGULARS, DRUG DEALERS\nand HOPEFUL RICH ADDICTS. In the privacy of the V.I.P.ROOM,\ndrug use is hardly concealed.\nLT sashays over to LITE'S table, sits down. LT has taken on\nan attitude of false bravado. He greets LITE with a crazy\ngrin. LITE is grim, doesn't respond in kind. He's not amused.\nLT orders a VODKA."
