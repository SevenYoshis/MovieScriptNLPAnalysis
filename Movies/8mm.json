Looks like a hotel\nroom.  We only ever see three walls.  The once beautiful\ngirl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes,\nstaring blankly.

The mask covers his entire head.\nHe's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled,\npale.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems\nto be saying something to her, but the film is silent and\nthe ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole\nCLATTER.  It's all one long take.

The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes\nclosed, but she remains upright.  Masked Man uses his thumbs\nto open her unseeing eyes.  He touches her mouth with his\nfingers, presses his lips to hers.  Then, Masked Man backs\naway, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked\nMan standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid\nout.  Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...\nWelles rises slowly, still watching.\nON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves\nback towards the girl...\nWelles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful.\nWE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM\n, but Welles\ndoes.  In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs\ninvoluntarily away from the horrible images, holding his\nfist to his mouth, breathing hard.\nWelles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall.\nThe PROJECTOR'S CLATTERING.
