   "text": "EXT. FOREST - DAWN\nBare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white\nlike ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled.\nSTARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a\ncreeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A\nLIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold.\nA CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as\nthe domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and\nrank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral.\nIt moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the\nforest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces\nacross a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:\nA DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare.\nFace frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in\nhis head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair.\nAs the cat moves closer, approaching warily:\nP.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING\nAbout thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW,\nDEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.\nCLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES\nThe MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked\nonto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.\nTHE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More\ncautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body.\nON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled\ntree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs\nand bracken. A \"ghillie suit\" of the kind used by snipers.\nTHE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a\ngrotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks\naround again, checking its surroundings for predators.\nTHE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering\nhim rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the\nfamiliar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.\nTHE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the\nwatcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An\ninterminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?\nFinally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass,\nnibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers."

   "text": "THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing\nand SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground.\nTHE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing\nhim to us for the first time.\nHe wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater\nwith more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work\nboots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear.\nAlong with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a\nDISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT\nwith dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat.\nAround his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT\nhanging from a frayed twine cord.\nHis name is ELI.\nHe shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches\nbeside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood\nfrom the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body.\nSuddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils,\nfalling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT\nFIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him.\nEli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the\nground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the\nwrithing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still.\nHe sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow.\nHe yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath.\nImpossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man.\nFor a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat\nand returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie\nsuit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back.\nA canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to\nits side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old\nSAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back.\nHe gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on\nhis cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK\nSMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH.\nEXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY\nEli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured\nasphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees."

He heads toward it.\nThe car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch.\nStripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a\nMUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead.\nEli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle\nbut it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually\nwrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet.\nThey're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath.\nHe leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he\nwalks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn\nloose, held in place now only by a rubber band.\nEXT. ROAD - DAY\nEli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in\nno hurry. A man who has been walking a long time.\nThe road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now\nthrough a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk.\nThe sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no\ncolor to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light\nleaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed.\nCRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of\na CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise\nfrom within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED\nAND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones.\nEli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on\nappears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on\nthe horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland.\nAfter a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down\nthe other fork, away from the city.\nEXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY\nLittle more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli\nwalks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris.\nIgnoring the petrified corpses lying in the street.\nHe passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty\nshelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even\nlook inside, knowing already that he will find nothing.\nUntil he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old-\nfashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze."

It swings\nopen on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from\nthe frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.\nINT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS\nEli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been\ncleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the\nfloor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.\nEli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword\nidly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.\nAs he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe\nbox. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off\nhopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.\nHe strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head\ngrimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.\nEXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY\nOn the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint,\nbroken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable.\nEli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish,\novergrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting\nsun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house.\nINT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY\nThe front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick,\nrevealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun\nunhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.\nAnother dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air.\nEverything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise\nlargely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.\nKITCHEN\nEvery cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in\nthe dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.\nHe opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small\nICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at\nit with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.\nInside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND.\nFloating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick\nenough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on."

Twisting gently back and forth.\nUnfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old\npair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal\nankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.\nHe checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and\nshakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards\nhis ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.\nHe walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the\nnew shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.\nLATER\nEli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat\nover a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he\nwatches it cook.

The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.\nSUNDOWN\nThe last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's\nbroken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a\nSMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.\nHe sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an\nOLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog-\neared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.\nEli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the\nbeat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.\nHe begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading\nsunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.\nMANY PAGES LATER\nEli closes the book and parcels it back up as before.\nReplaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.\nA CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to\na tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli\nreaches into his pocket and produces:\nAN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together\nwith duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery\ncable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.\nThe music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor.\nEli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.\nTHE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air,\nas though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by\nthe music to another world, a world far from this one.\nMORNING\nSunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the\nexact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.\nThe rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly,\nhe wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on.\nChecks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.\nHe gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside.\nAll seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons."

Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt.\nThe road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a\nworld long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road\nreads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: \"CIRCUIT CITY\".\nUp ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli\narrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in\nfilthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.\nThe SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a\nroadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of\nfood, old clothes.
