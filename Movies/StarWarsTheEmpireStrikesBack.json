   "text": "THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\nWritten by\nLawrence Kasdan\nand\nLeigh Brackett\nFrom a story by George Lucas\nEXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH\nA Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots\nfrom its underside.\nOne of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-\ncovered surface.  An explosion marks the point of\nimpact.\nEXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY\nA weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A\nstrange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the\nsmoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the\nsnow plain and disappears into the distance.\nEXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY\nA small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled\nrider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving\nplumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged\nbeast.\nThe rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling\noff his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the\nsky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and\nthrough them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.\nThe wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink\ntransmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him."
