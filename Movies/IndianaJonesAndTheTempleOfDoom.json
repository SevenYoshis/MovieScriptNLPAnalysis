   "text": "INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM\nSTORY BY:\nGEORGE LUCAS\nSCREENPLAY BY:\nWILLARD HUYCK\nAND\nGLORIA KATZ\nTM* & (c) Lucasfilm Ltd., 1984\nFADE IN:\n1.     INT.  \"THE DRAGON\" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                            1.\nA Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco pa-\npoda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which\nrows of beautiful women start descending   (BEGIN MAIN TITLES)\nThe lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange,\nhaunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if it\nweren't for their sexy, clinging lame gowns.\n2.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                             2.\nFrom the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty\nface: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat-\nup American baseball cap.\nSneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns\nand silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom.\n3.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                              3.\nShort Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub.  On the\nstage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around\nthe pagoda.\nNow, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and\nits enormous jaws open.  Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star\nof the stage show:\nWILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or-\nchestra wails the accompaniment.\nBut Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames.  He surveys\nthe rich Chinese, American and European revelers.  Jewels flash\nand champagne flows.  Short Round finally spots a table of\nsomber-looking Chinese men in suits.\nShort Round chews gum and stares at the men.  Then he turns to\ngo.  WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short\nRound leave.\n4.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                            4.\nAs Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a\ntuxedo entering the club.  Short Round looks up at the man, but\nwe don't see his face.\nThen Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door-\nman hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the\nway.\nA maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check\ngirls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom.\nWe notice something incongruous:  the man in the tuxedo is wear-\ning work boots caked with mud.\n5.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                             5.\nThe man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing sexily\non the stage.  Then he looks around and sees the table of somber\nChinese men that Short Round spotted earlier.\nAs the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a\ncigarette from a silver case.  He arrives at the table just as\nthe chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo --\nAnd on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham-\nmer toward an enormous brass gong --\nThe man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette-\ngirl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to reveal his face\nfor the first time:\nIt's INDIANA JONES.  Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill.  The\nTITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen:\nSHANGHAI - 1935\nAt the table, the four Chinese man in suits stare coldly at Indi-\nana."
