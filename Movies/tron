The montage takes place in two worlds, the\nELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD.\nThe Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the\nelectronic information in our computers, television sets and\ntelecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs,\ndata, and the characters from countless video games. For the first\ntime, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through\nthe window of television screens.\nCUT TO:\n2    CYCLE GAME                                                   2\nTWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a\ndark background.
