(MONTAGE).                                                   1A.\nNIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME begins as we FADE UP on a SERIES OF SHOTS,\nall CLOSE and teasing.\n-- A man's FEET, in shabby work shoes, stalking\nthrough a junk bin in a dark, fire-lit, ash-\ndusted place.  A huge BOILER ROOM is what it\nis, although we only glimpse it piecemeal.\nThen we SEE a MAN'S HAND, dirty and nail-bitten,\nreach INTO FRAME and pick up a piece of METAL.\n-- ANOTHER ANGLE as the HAND grabs a grimey\nWORKGLOVE and slashes at it with a straight\nrazor, until its fingertips are off.\n-- CLOSE ON SAME HANDS dumping four fishing knives\nout of a filthy bag.  Their blades are thin,\ncurved, gleaming sharp.\n-- MORE ANGLES, EVEN CLOSER.  We can HEAR the MAN's\nwheezing BREATHING, but we still haven't seen\nhis face.  We never will.  We just SEE more metal\nbeing assembled with crude tools, into some sort\nof linkage -- a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus,\nagainst a background light of FIRE, and a deep\nrushing of STEAM and HEAVY, DARK ENERGY.\n-- And then we see this linkage attached to the glove.\n-- Then the BLADES attached to all of it.\n-- Then the MAN'S HAND slips into this glove-like\napparatus, filling it out and transforming\nit into an awesome, deadly claw-hand with\nfour razor/talons gleaming at its blackened\nfingertips.  Suddenly the HAND arches and STRIKES\nFORWARD, SLASHING THROUGH a DARK CANVAS, tearing\nit to shreds.\n1.    EXT.  LOS ANGELES.  NIGHT.  (2nd Unit)                             1.\nA PULSATION OF LIGHT AND SHADOW.  MUSIC DROPS AWAY to a hushed\nRUSHING OF WIND and DISTANT SIRENS.  CAMERA RACKS INTO FOCUS on a\nHIGH PANORAMA of the San Fernando Valley, its night sky lit from\nwithin by a strange GREENISH LIGHT.  TITLES BEGIN.\nCAMERA TILTS DOWN and ZOOMS SWIFTLY into the valley's web of\nlight.\nCUT TO:\n2.    INT.  CONCRETE PASSAGEWAY.                                         2.\nTITLES CONTINUE as TINA GRAY, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin\nnight shift, moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor.  Her\nsteps quicken as TITLES appear in the portion of frame she leaves\nfree.\nA subliminal COLLAGE of SOUND threads in and out of the MUSIC.\nDistant insane LAUGHTER.  Slamming iron DOORS.  A bleating animal\nCRY.  A LAMB, white and blank-faced, skitters across her path and\non into the dark.  No reason why it's there.\nThen another SOUND, much nearer -- the slithering SCRAPE of\nsomething like\nfingernails\nacross slate.  It sets our teeth on\nedge, twists the MUSIC, and sends TINA running.\n3.    INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 3.\nSuddenly TINA's a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam\npipes and catwalks -- a shadowed forest of iron and stone.  She\nstops, listening intently as the SOUND of tiny hooves suddenly\nturns into the rattle of DISTANT RAIN.\nThen she hears RIPPING FABRIC.\nSomeone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas,\napproaching TINA.\nCLOSER ON THE CANVAS.  The long curved fingerblades suddenly\npunch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping\nthrough the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh.\nThey make a hideous, extended RIPPING SOUND.\nTINA rushes away, hands over her ears.\nANOTHER ANGLE -- as the blinded girl stumbles backwards.  Then\nthe canvas flaps free.  The blades are gone.  The TITLES END, and\neverything goes silent.\nCAMERA CIRCLES until TINA's looking right into our eyes.  The\nlight from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress,\nleaving her naked and vulnerable.  Then a deep, ragged VOICE\nwhispers at her as CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HER FACE."

She crosses to her bed.\nNext\nsecond the KILLER dives through her window and seizes her in a\nshower of shattered glass\nNANCY twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with\nboth of hers, barely keeping the blades from her throat.\nThe two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing\nonto NANCY's bed.  Her grip is broken -- the MAN stabs -- NANCY\ntwists away, backed into a corner of bed and walls.  Defenseless,\nshe snatches a pillow up; the KILLER lashes out -- disemboweling\nthe pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying.  NANCY\ndives for escape in a virtual blizzard.\nThe KILLER manages to snare her with his other hand, and the two\ncrash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all\nits contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers.\nANGLE AT FLOOR LEVEL -- CLOSE ON NANCY'S AND THE KILLER'S HEADS.\nThe blades inch towards the girl's face -- the drool of the\ngrizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her\neyes.  Feathers are everywhere; MUSIC is absolutely insane!\nBut just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her\neyes, the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to\nNANCY's head goes off with a jarring RINGGGGGGG!\n96.   Instantly the MUSIC STOPS.  And a moment later the room is         96.\nlight.\nWIDER as NANCY reels up, blinded by the sudden light, SCREAMING\nAND FIGHTING\non her bed\nANGLE ON GLEN, lurching from his own sleep at the frightening\nnoise.  He discovers NANCY pressed in terror against her\nheadboard, clutching a pillow like a drowning woman would a\nstraw.\nIt's an intact pillow, and there isn't a feather in sight.\nNANCY stares incredulously at GLEN, then around the room,\nuntangling herself from her bedclothes.  Wary and furious, her\nvoice hoarse."

Uniformed POLICEMEN spill\nout FOREGROUND.\nLT THOMPSON and PARKER exit the unmarked car.  By habit or by\npremonition THOMPSON glances at the house that was his home.  His\neye is caught by a movement; his daughter is at her upstairs\nwindow, white-haired, hollow-eyed, looking down on him through\nher bars.  She gives a little wave.\nUnnerved, THOMPSON waves back, then walks rapidly for GLEN's\nhome.  MR LANTZ, pale as a ghost himself, waits on the porch; we\ncan hear the mother's WAILING inside.\n166.
