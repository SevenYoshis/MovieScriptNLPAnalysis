On the road a GERMAN PEASANT FATHER\nis herding along three sickly looking cows.  His two SONS\nare with him.  His youngest son sits on one of the cows\nand sings a soft, plaintive song.\nThey become aware of another sound behind them on the road\n-- the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather.  The\nFather immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the\nroad.  They stand-still, eyes down:  the familiar posture\nof subjugated peoples throughout history.\nA wagon train rumbles past them.  Three ornate wagons\nfollowed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily-armed\nPRAETORIAN GUARDS.\nThe young boy dares to glance up at the passing Romans.\nHis eyes burn with hatred."

On each platform is a snarling\nBengal tiger restrained by a chain.  Tiger's teams of\n\"cornermen\" hold the chains through a pulley system.  The\ncornermen are safely inside cages.  The platforms stop at\nground level.\nThe four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the\nbattleground.\nTiger takes advantage of Maximus' momentary confusion and\nassaults brutally -- forcing him back toward one of the\ntigers -- the tiger claws for Maximus -- Maximus just\nevades it claws -- rolls for a new position -- another\ntiger snaps at him --\nTiger attacks -- Maximus is on the defensive -- fighting\noff Tiger and evading the four snarling beasts --\nAnd then all four tigers are suddenly closer.  The teams\nof cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit,\ngradually reducing the size of the battle ground.  The\ncrowd roars.\nBut the fight is hardly fair.\nWhenever Tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen\npull back the tiger slightly -- when Maximus is near a\ntiger they let it out a bit.\nMaximus and Tiger fight -- swirling action -- finally,\nMaximus has the edge -- he circles so that the sun stabs\ninto Tiger's eyes -- then Maximus lunges forward under\nTiger's swinging sword and SLAMS into him -- they fall --\na tiger swats at Maximus' face -- he jerks his head back\n-- he shoots out a leg and kicks Tiger's sword toward one\nof the tigers -- it is out of reach -- Maximus leaps up\nand stands over the winded Tiger, sword to his throat.\nTiger is gasping for breath, crushed.\nThen one of Tiger's corners suddenly cheats -- they\ncompletely release a tiger -- it leaps for Maximus --\nMaximus barely has time to turn -- the tiger crashes into\nhim -- its claws slashing into his back, cutting through\nhis leather armor -- Maximus shoves an armored forearm\ninto the tiger's jaws and stabs with his sword --\nTiger takes this chance to pull himself up -- one of his\ncorners throws him another sword -- the crowd boos --\nMaximus wrestles with the tiger -- spinning it around with\nsuperhuman effort so it is always between himself and\nTiger -- so that Tiger can't get at him --\nMaximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for Tiger -- he\nquickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground --\nMaximus stands over him -- ready to administer the coup de\ngrace.\nAll eyes turn to the Emperor.\nCommodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the\nImperial Box.  He raises his arm and gives the fatal\nthumbs down.\nMaximus looks up at him.\nAnd then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground,\nrefusing to kill Tiger.\nCommodus is stunned.\nThe crowd gasps -- a collective intake of breath -- and\nthen an enormous roar building.  It cascades around the\nColosseum.  It is a roaring celebration of the unexpected\nact of mercy.  And the delicious act of defiance of the\nEmperor.\nCommodus slowly sits.\nMaximus walks across the arena -- the people stand and\ncheer for him.  Cries of \"Maximus the Merciful\" can be\nheard.\nIt is the birth of a hero."
